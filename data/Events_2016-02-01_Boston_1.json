All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Professor West will discuss that, for the first time in human history, we know that planets are common around other stars and that most of the stars in our Galaxy (and others) are not like our Sun, but instead cooler, smaller, and fainter. He will talk about what we know about exoplanets and what his research group is doing to study and help characterize the red dwarfs around which most exoplanets orbit.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Science by the Pint<\/b> is sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.\u00a0 In between their sleepless hours of hard work at Harvard Med School, they bring cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Burren<\/b> is located on Elm Street right in the heart of Davis Square, just a short walk from the Red Line stop.\u00a0 If you prefer to drive, there are metered spots on the street and in nearby municipal lots (see link below).\u00a0 Meters are active until 8:00 PM, and metered spots are free thereafter.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/227610259\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlyvcbpb","time":1452556800000,"updated":1452571815000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01970","country":"us","city":"Salem","address_1":"254 Essex Street, Suite 204","name":"Essence of Healing","lon":-70.896767,"id":12620772,"state":"MA","lat":42.521461,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.258310318,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415654571000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for a guided meditation to help you achieve a state of well-being, relaxation, and strengthen your connection to self.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Each week, Elaine &amp; Nicol alternate leading the group in a guided meditation to induce a deepened state of relaxation, healing on all levels.\u00a0 You can achieve an expanded state of self and a higher state of consciousness, connecting you to the ALL that IS!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Elaine and Nicol are able to connect with the most highest vibrations and frequencies of light\u00a0that serves the group as a whole.\u00a0 Your personal experience will be enhanced by the group setting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>All levels of meditators are welcome to join us.\u00a0 A sacred space is created to help you feel safe and comfortable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please RSVP your intention on attending.\u00a0 Cost is $5 at the door.\u00a0 Doors open at 6:45pm with the group staring at 7pm!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Visit our website for more info <a href=\"http:\/\/www.essencehealing.net\/\">www.essencehealing.net<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/227640067\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Weekly Meditation Group","id":"qbfnclyvcbpb","time":1452556800000,"updated":1452569137000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Natick","phone":"508-655-9636","address_1":"13 Common Street","name":"Common Street Spiritual Center","lon":-71.346542,"id":23688124,"state":"MA","lat":42.282578,"repinned":false},"headcount":11,"distance":15.137471199,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449352340000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>{Pick up new insights about your own relationships, while supporting and getting to know a fellow member of the MetroWest personal growth community} <\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/5\/a\/600_355870842.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Our Guest This Evening<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/4\/1\/600_444923361.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Wendy Williams, R.N., M.Ed., is a PGN member from Framingham who is passionate about\u00a0helping married people break out of old ruts and connect again with their significant others.<\/p> <p>As a marriage mentor, she helps\u00a0couples create\u00a0soul-satisfying (re)connections with simple, reliable, practical methods.\u00a0She also co-hosts the weekly Mighty Married Moms podcast, where she regularly interviews guests on topics related to health, relationships, and family life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Wendy is coming to this evening's Heartbeat Salon not only to share some of what she's learned and observed about long-term relationships, but also -- and perhaps more importantly -- to share her story, and ask for our collective wisdom and guidance as she seeks to have the greatest possible impact in her work.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Some of the key questions she's coming with include:<\/p> <p>\u2022 How do different people relate to the things I have to say about marriage and relationships?

He explores the history of places, like Vienna of 1900, Renaissance Florence, ancient Athens, Song Dynasty Hangzhou, and Silicon Valley, to show how certain urban settings are conducive to ingenuity. And, with his trademark insightful humor, he walks the same paths as the geniuses who flourished in these settings to see if the spirit of what inspired figures like Socrates, Michelangelo, and Leonardo remains. In these places, Weiner asks, \u201cWhat was in the air, and can we bottle it?\u201d<\/p> <p>This link can be traced back through history: Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution gelled while he was riding in a carriage. Freud did his best thinking at this favorite coffee house. Beethoven, like many geniuses, preferred long walks in the woods.<\/p> <p>Sharp and provocative, The Geography of Genius redefines the argument about how genius came to be. His reevaluation of the importance of culture in nurturing creativity is an informed romp through history that will surely jumpstart a national conversation.Praise<\/p> <p>\u201cAn intellectual odyssey, a traveler\u2019s diary, and a comic novel all rolled into one.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227754935\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvcbpb","time":1452558600000,"updated":1452570891000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hudson","address_1":"582 Main Street","name":"Regina's Connection","lon":-71.49984,"id":21872462,"state":"MA","lat":42.392548,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.0998897552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452178546000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Chant the powerful mantra of non myoho range kyo<br\/>to clear and realign your energy while opening you to abundance.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/227428091\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"Traditional Multi-player Card Games","id":"227428091","time":1452639600000,"updated":1452734154000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"4 Copley Place, 2nd Floor","name":"InsightSquared","lon":-71.078598,"id":24299609,"state":"MA","lat":42.347256,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":115,"headcount":108,"distance":0.986004889011,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1449606686000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A lot of people talk about \u201cSales Culture\u201d, but how does one create culture and what does a great sales culture really look like?

With more attention to his record, the White House sees the address as a chance to tout arguments Obama has already made, especially those related to the environment and trade.

Michelle Obama, meanwhile, will leave one seat in her box empty \"for the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice,\" the White House said. Other seats in the first lady's box will be occupied by Edith Childs of Greenwood, South Carolina, and Earl Smith of Austin, Texas. Childs, a Greenwood County councilor, is known for her \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d chant that became an unofficial slogan of Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Smith gave Obama in February 2008 a military patch he wore while serving in Vietnam. The patch struck a chord with Obama, and the then-presidential candidate carried it in his pocket throughout his campaign. The first lady will also host Jim Obergefell, who was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Refaai Hamo, a Syrian refugee living in Troy, Michigan; and Spencer Stone, who helped prevent an attack on a Paris-bound train last year; among others.<\/p> <p>Who\u2019s delivering the GOP response?<br\/>Long seen as a rising star in the GOP and as a potential vice presidential pick, South Carolina Gov.

Trove provides methods to manage these databases throughout their lifecycle and perform operations like backup and restore, configure and operate complex topologies like replication and clustering, and manage the configuration settings of these databases. Trove currently supports relational databases like MySQL (including MariaDB and Percona), PostgreSQL, and Vertica, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, CouchDB, and Redis.<\/p> <p>An important aspect of Trove is that it is easy to add support for a new database and in this talk we illustrate how one can add support for a new database in Trove using the example of Apache HBase. In this presentation, we describe the architecture of Trove and the actual code changes required to add support for Apache HBase in Trove and demonstrate a simple Apache HBase database orchestrated by Trove.<\/p> <p><b><i>Reminders:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A light dinner and soft drinks will be provided <b>courtesy of Tesora <\/b>~ <b>6:15pm<\/b> and we will kick off the sessions ~ 7:00pm.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If you are interested in giving a Lightening Talk shoot us a note with a topic or just come to the session ready to speak!<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>DON'T FORGET -<\/b> for security reasons, the NERD center requires attendees to show a government issued photo ID in order to gain access into the building.<\/p> <p>\u2022<b> Parking: <\/b>Best option for parking is the NERD center parking garage which charges a flat rate after 4pm.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Openstack-Boston\/events\/227826780\/","yes_rsvp_count":87,"name":"OpenStack and data bases!","id":"227826780","time":1452642300000,"updated":1452655038000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1319666895000,"name":"Openstack Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":2713322,"urlname":"Openstack-Boston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"stackers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02453","country":"us","city":"Waltham","address_1":"415 South Street","name":"Brandeis University","lon":-71.25885,"id":13852582,"state":"MA","lat":42.366249,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.67082595825,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434505401000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We'll park at the Brandeis track and then run the loop around Brandeis.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Come spend an evening hanging out with the local Progress Community, including members of the OpenEdge development team.<\/p> <p>1) Data Plus<\/p> <p>In 1990, faced with the demise of the minicomputer market, Data Plus migrated its Hospitality-specific\u00a0 back office system to Progress. For an IDE, Xponent, itself written in Progress, was chosen to provide forms-based Progress 4GL code generation, report generation, and source code control. Continued development of the Xponent system itself ended a number of years ago, and we realized that a complete system rewrite was required to modernize the application using Object Oriented programming with modern n-tier architecture. We were able to bring the current code up to OE 11 as a stop-gap measure to continue deployment on current client and server operating systems. After two-plus years we are about to launch the eighth generation of our product using GUI for .NET, an OO programming style and the Progress App Server. This presentation is intended to describe the evaluation and selection process that we went through with the assistance of Progress and others in the Progress community to create an entirely new system.<\/p> <p>2) \u00a0Roundtable Software\u00a0 Projects must be on time and under budget. With ever increasing demands, maintaining mature, consistent software configuration management practices is critical to ongoing success \u2026 but is not always an easy thing to accomplish. Built on and for the OpenEdge platform, Roundtable TSMS can provide the tools to make those practices clear, repeatable, and scalable, while also reducing time-to-market, improving product quality, and ensuring SOX compliance. This presentation explores how the Roundtable TSMS plug-in for Progress Developer Studio helps to provide these benefits and more for hundreds of OpenEdge development teams worldwide, large and small, putting them firmly in control of their development projects. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We expect members of the progress OpenEdge development team to be present at this meetup well.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will serve Pizza, Beer and Soft drinks.

Today, Sonic Osmosis is a playground for Improvised Music. If you ever met Improvised Music, you know she has a free spirit.

Sadly, many venues don\u2019t have the patience to indulge Improvised Music and her whimsical ways. \u201cSell more drinks!\u201d they scream at her. Thank [higher power] for Out of the Blue Too Gallery!<\/p> <p>Once a month (or so), we book a handful of groups and solo performers who have made the foolhardy choice to court this lovely, impetuous muse. Each group\/artist plays at least one 10-20 minute set, at some point during the night -- no set times, because of course, Improvised Music would scoff at the idea.<\/p> <p>Mixed in between these sets, we shake it up!

Members of different groups might form an impromptu ensemble; two or more groups might fuse into a super-group in a brilliant stellar collision\u2026<\/p> <p>And maybe\u2026bold audience members, who came with noise-makers in tow, step into the playground and add their verse to our collective ode. Don\u2019t worry -- no one will pressure you to participate, for the muse surely would not approve.<\/p> <p>Hopefully, by the end of the night we have expanded our vocabulary, sensitivity, and imagination, had some fun and satisfied our insatiable muse!<\/p> <p>If you\u2019ve still got questions about what this is all about, my name is Marc, leave me a message!

Paul, her less-than-attentive father, took her from from her unfit mother, and he and Tooly traveled from Australia to Bangkok, thanks to his short-term, government-funded computer assignments. Left to her own devices much of the time, it seemed inevitable that Tooly would fall in with a ragtag group of ex-pats\u2014mercurial Sarah, Russian literature lover Humphrey, and their Svengali-like leader, Venn\u2014who took her under their collective wing. What is not predictable, however, is that Tooly will be abducted once again when Venn and company elevate her from mascot to compatriot. Rachman, celebrated for The Imperfectionists (2010), spans the last 30 years in this tale of a rocky road to adulthood. Over the course of flashbacks and fast-forward escapades, Tooly gradually pieces together the jigsaw of her unconventional life to confront a complete picture that isn\u2019t always comforting.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

But the most potent innovation is not the currency itself. Rather, it\u2019s the technology that undergirds bitcoin, the distributed-ledger technology known as the blockchain that allows payments to flow through an economy in an entirely decentralized way\u2014without banks or other intermediaries. This infant technology could change the financial system; think the Internet before browsers. It could reduce the cost and increase in the speed and accuracy of financial transactions; it could truly disrupt the banking business. Or it could fizzle. But already it is raising a host of policy questions \u2013 about financial stability, consumer protection, choking off terrorists' finances, and tensions between established and upstart financial institutions and between regulatory agencies.<\/p> <p>On January 14, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will explore the future of distributed ledger technology, paying special attention to the innovation\u2019s impact on financial services and policymaking. Hutchins Center director David Wessel will convene leading industry and policy experts for a panel discussion.

But the most potent innovation is not the currency itself. Rather, it\u2019s the technology that undergirds bitcoin, the distributed-ledger technology known as the blockchain that allows payments to flow through an economy in an entirely decentralized way\u2014without banks or other intermediaries. This infant technology could change the financial system; think the Internet before browsers. It could reduce the cost and increase in the speed and accuracy of financial transactions; it could truly disrupt the banking business. Or it could fizzle. But already it is raising a host of policy questions \u2013 about financial stability, consumer protection, choking off terrorists' finances, and tensions between established and upstart financial institutions and between regulatory agencies.<\/p> <p>On January 14, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will explore the future of distributed ledger technology, paying special attention to the innovation\u2019s impact on financial services and policymaking. Hutchins Center director David Wessel will convene leading industry and policy experts for a panel discussion.

Quil is a popular Clojure graphical library, but as is it has a very imperative feel to it. Two recent additions to Quil help programming in a purely functional style:<\/p> <p>functional mode (\"fun-mode\") middleware by Nikita Beloglazov which is a functional MVC model for handling state: one needs to supply event handlers that take the old state and return the new one.<\/p> <p>A small library for creating and manipulating first class shapes that was developed by my students Thomas Hagen and Ryan McArthur last summer. It allows defining shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, imported images, etc. as values in a program, combine them into complex shapes using functions such as \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbeside\u201d, and then draw them on a specified position on the canvas when needed. The approach is modeled after the Racket programming language.<\/p> <p>The combination of the two approaches provides a \u201csuper-fun\u201d mode that is beginner-friendly, purely functional, and abstracts over a lot of low-level details.<br\/><b>Bio<\/b>: Elena has been teaching computer science at University of Minnesota, Morris, an undergraduate public liberal arts college, since 2003. Her Ph.D. is from Boston University. For the last couple of years she has been working with students on a project ClojureEd that focuses on putting together a CS1 course (a first course that students would take in a CS major or a minor) that incorporates Clojure.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Talk #2) Focused UI Component Development with Devcards<\/b> - David Mohs<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Description<\/b>: Devcards is a ClojureScript development tool by the author of Figwheel, Bruce Huaman. It creates a UI with \"cards\" pulled from your codebase, which allow you to focus on a single UI element during development. The documentation is great, so this demo will focus purely on motivation and practical usage.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b>: David is a software engineer at the Broad Institute, a YC Founder, and formerly an engineer at Google.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Near the Kendall Square T stop","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Clojure-Group\/events\/227354955\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"2 Talks: Quil and DevCards","id":"ddqvjjyvcbsb","time":1452814200000,"updated":1453089479000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294421299000,"name":"Boston Clojure Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1761322,"urlname":"Boston-Clojure-Group","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Dedham","address_1":"Dedham Plaza Shopping Center","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-71.167656,"id":24142030,"state":"MA","lat":42.24361,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.48373413086,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1409060656000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a group of independent players (intermediate through highly experienced).

Today school gardens have taken a turn into the 21st century. With modern advancements in agricultural technology these \"Learning Gardens\" have opened the door for students to learn well past plant anatomy and cultivation techniques.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

It is this experience toward which the course is directed.\" (ACIM Manual for Teachers)<\/p> <p>Designed to correct perception and lead to a universal experience of knowledge, A Course In Miracles has been translated into 23 languages, is referenced and utilized by many of today's most reknowned spiritual teachers, and has inspired countless books and curriculums based on its teachings. But it can be a difficult book to grasp. It is lengthy, the writing is abstract, and its use of Christian terminology alienates many.<\/p> <p>And yet it has become one of the most influential spiritual books of today.\u00a0Join us as we dive into it, and are led to understand its principles against the backdrop of our own personal experiences and insights.\u00a0Beginner as well as advanced Course students are welcome.

When two new lovers are naked for the first time, there is an electricity that creates a scent that is arousing to them, but will nauseate any passersby. What we're saying is that you're better off seeing The Rekcus perform than hearing about it second hand.<\/p> <p>Then: your headliner: INTERESTING POINTS with panelists Steve Delfino (Terrible People), Laura Clark (Good Loser), Kevin Quigley (Naked Comedy Showcase), Jenny Chilikian (Mendoza Line), and Matt Kona (The Comedy Studio) and your host Josh Poirier! What is it about funny people that makes them interesting? Is it the things they know or the things they do? Is it the memories they share or the lies they make up? Whatever it is, it's hilarious. Boston's best comedy panel show is BACK. Five comedians answering questions, having fun, and making you laugh is the name of the game!<\/p> <p>And: our first OPENHAUS of 2016! That's right - YOUR sketch comedy open mic. Bring an untried five minute (or fewer) script, we'll provide the actors, and see your creation ON STAGE!

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

It is time to let in the light people!<\/p> <p>In Sanskrit, the movement of the Sun from one zodiac sign into another is called Sankranti and makara is the movement of the sun into the zodiacal sign of capricorn.<\/p> <p>In this sound healing, we will focus our intention on manifesting strength, as capricorn is a power sign. We will also focus on what we are harvesting in our life now and what we want to plant\u00a0for our next harvest!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?\u00a0<\/p> <p>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Pllease bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!

It will be a smaller group. Please order your tickets now at www.johnnyds.com . Tickets will sell out quickly and I can't guarantee you can join us unless you buy the tickets. Two bands, one full evening of dancing and musical fun.<\/p> <p>The Band That Time Forgot:<\/p> <p>This rag-tag group of hard working elders have meant a lot to many people through the years - from students to scientists, from bikers to full-swing golfers. And still they rise\u2026. and fall ... and rise ... and stumble....and rise again Disgruntled with a lack of recognition and with babies on the horizon, Stash devised a name \u201cThe Band That Time Forgot \u201d and a concept - the band would play the greatest 60\u2019s songs that nobody else would ever play. But a name with no band is no band. Stash called his pal Head West whose career he had been trying to ruin since 1972. There was only one truly great keyboard\/guitar playing\/singer to call Sonny California. After a few false starts they managed to convince Rainbow (then Richard) that such a band might have fun, make money, start a commune, have dozens of children, and eat many mushrooms. Rainbow being one the nicest guys in the world (everybody says so - though he can be very bad, too) said OK. And thus the band was born....<\/p> <p>The Love Dogs: Take one red-hot horn section - we're talkin' alto, tenor, baritone saxes and trombone - down and dirty. Add liberal amounts of barrelhouse boogie-woogie piano and stinging Fender guitar. Pour over a funky and swinging rhythm section that Blues Review magazine called \"the best in the business\", and top it all off with a crazy and charismatic front man with one of the biggest blues voices around. Season with a few years on the road tearing up juke joints, festivals and concert halls across the U.S. and Canada and on both sides of the Atlantic. Sound tasty? It's a recipe for music and mayhem, for intensity and irreverence; it's THE LOVE DOGS.<\/p> <p>Based out of Boston, this hard blowing septet just celebrated its sixteenth year wowing audiences and critics alike with their combination of great musicianship and pure fun. The Dogs combine elements of jump blues, New Orleans R&amp;B and early rock 'n' roll into their own powerhouse sound. You can hear it loud and clear on their three Tone-Cool cds \"I'm Yo Dog\" (1996), \"Heavy Petting\" (1998) and \"New Tricks\" (2000). Many of the cuts from these three discs have been blues radio favorites, several of the Dogs' signature original songs have been used in feature films and on television, and one has even been sampled for use on the upcoming Run-DMC cd!<\/p> <p>But as much fun as the Dogs' studio discs are, it's nothing compared to seeing them live. FMQB magazine called Love Dogs' concerts \"the stuff of legend\" where \"soulful vocals, killer grooves, unpredictability and pure entertainment play equal parts\". With their newest cd \"Live And On Fire\" The Love Dogs have finally captured the unbridled energy of their live show on disc. Far from a live retread of previously recorded tunes, \"Live And On Fire\" features ten brand new tracks captured live on a summer weekend at the famous Sea Note nightclub on the outskirts of Boston.<\/p> <p>\"It's important to us to have fun, and sometimes even we don't know what we're gonna do next.\" says lead vocalist and songwriter EDDIE \"DUATO\" SCHEER, a former sideman of R&amp;B legend Johnny Adams. \"We have a lot of humor in our music, and we love to surprise each other and make each other laugh. When a crowd can see that, it becomes contagious. Pretty soon they're giving us back as much energy as we're putting out, and the whole thing keeps escalating. We call it the 'tribal love vibe'\".<\/p> <p>Featuring some of the Northeast's best players, it's impossible not to notice the high level of musicianship in this band. \"We're all lifetime fans of blues, jazz, and R&amp;B, and we all have a real reverence for the music. Part of what makes this band special is that we really play together as a unit, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" The band's lineup consists of SCHEER, ALIZON LISSANCE (keyboards, vocals), MYANNA (alto\/tenor sax, vocals), GLENN SHAMBROOM (guitar, baritone sax), RANDY BRAMWELL (bass, vocals), STEVE BROWN (drums, vocals), along with part time Dogs MARIO PERRETT (tenor sax\/vocals), MARK PAQUIN (tenor sax, trombone) and old friend \"SAX\" GORDON BEADLE (tenor and baritone sax).<\/p> <p>Part Rat Pack party, part 20th century musical encyclopedia, and part revival meeting, \"Live And On Fire\" showcases the Dogs at their best, leaving their audience breathless and begging for more. The New York Post says \"Even though the music could make Leonardo's David dance, it's the songwriting that separates these dogs from the rest of the pack\" and Blues Review agrees \"If there were a Superbowl for crowd pleasing rhythm &amp; blues, a photo of The Love Dogs would be on every Wheaties box in America.\" Scheer sums it up by saying \"If this band doesn't put a smile on your face, check your pulse because you just might be dead.\"<\/p> <p>go to Johnny D's and make reservations now - tickets are very limited, as are spaces at our tables.

It is a way of communicating with your inner or spirit self and retrieving information. Your inner self is in constant communication with all aspects of your environment, seen and unseen. You need only journey within to find answers to your questions. Be prepared, however, for whatever insights you may receive, whether you like them or not.<br\/>The spirit healing journey is not always what people expect, and sometimes there is uncertainty as to what one should experience in altered states. The ecstatic trance is an individual journey into non-ordinary reality; therefore, experiences vary from person to person and from journey to journey. Once you enter a trance state, the rhythm or sound of the drum tends to change. The drumbeat may appear to speed up or slow down, while the sound may grow louder, softer, or disappear. You may experience a change in body temperature, feel energy flowing through your body, or find yourself twitching, swaying, or rocking. It is not uncommon to hear sounds or voices. You may even smell specific aromas. You may see colorful patterns, symbolic images, or dreamlike visions. Some people may find that they have a highly developed inner vision while others may rely more on instinct, intuition, or intent.<br\/>During the spirit healing journey, one's awareness transcends ordinary reality. In journeys to the Lower World, one may experience the sensation of falling, sliding, or spiraling downward into or under the Earth. In Upper World journeys, one may experience the sensation of rising, floating, flying, or spiraling upward through the air or sky. Journeys to the Lower World involve the movement of awareness to a level beneath ordinary reality and Celestial journeys involve movement to a level above ordinary reality. Lower levels are denser, lower in frequency, and more involved with the physical body, the earthly plane, and material reality. Higher levels are higher in frequency, less dense, and subtler.<br\/>You will experience at least two spiritual journeys. You do not need prior journeying experiences but an openness of the process and possibilities. Elaine is a training and practicing Shaman and will safely lead you on your journey. Please bring a yoga mat, blanket, something to cover your eyes (scarf), and journal as you may wish to write your experiences immediately following the journey. $10 Any questions or to register please contact Elaine [masked] or[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/227688681\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"An Evening of Shamanic Spiritual Healing","id":"qdwwpgyvcbvb","time":1452987000000,"updated":1453075330000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Lowell","address_1":"353 Wilder Street, Floor 1 (corner of Wilder St and Princeton Blvd)","name":"Darrick and Lindsay's place","lon":-71.331406,"id":23556745,"state":"MA","lat":42.635792,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.2950458527,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452607479000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>*** Please read and\/or post comments below for additional info. ***<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/6\/2\/600_83177762.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us this new year for our\u00a0<b>2016 Season of Reason Party!<\/b>\u00a0This will be our 8th\u00a0winter celebration for the Greater Lowell\u00a0skeptic and atheist community!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please come and enjoy some\u00a0warm intellectual\u00a0conversations around a variety of delicious\u00a0potluck food-ery, fun science swap-ery, and maybe a little tomfoolery.<\/p> <p>The science swap has been really fun in past years and it is now tradition.

Are you ready for the one and only Carl Craig?<\/p> <p>Carl Craig is described as a creative visionary, an electronic music icon, an esteemed Grammy-nominated composer, a world-class DJ and an ambassador for<br\/>his native Detroit. Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical<br\/>canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. The prolific<br\/>producer has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader,<br\/>guided by his tendency toward forward thinking.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy livelihood is making music that I can perform, whether I\u2019m doing orchestral<br\/>production or modular strangeness or generating club music. I don\u2019t restrict<br\/>myself,\u201d said Craig. \u201cI defined myself by being who I am. The ultimate self respect<br\/>is when you say you\u2019re going to do something and you go and do it to the best of<br\/>your ability.\u201d<\/p> <p>Craig released his first track in 1989 on a Virgin UK compilation album, with two<br\/>singles following on labels run by his first collaborator Derrick May. After a series<br\/>of ambitious releases for his co-owned Retroactive imprint, in 1991 Craig launched<br\/>his second record label Planet E with the groundbreaking EP \u201c4 Jazz Funk Classics\u201d,<br\/>under his alias 69. Planet-E turned 20 in 2011 and Craig celebrated the label\u2019s<br\/>history by taking Planet-E and its artists and collaborators on a world tour for the<br\/>first time ever. He also previewed the 69 Live show for the first time, at select<br\/>festivals around the world, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig<br\/>created 69\u2019s own entity. As well as this, Planet-E invited friends of the label \u2013 like<br\/>Luciano, Kirk Del Giorgio, Loco Dice and more - to pick their favourite Planet-E<br\/>track to remix and re-release. Reflecting a year that was packed with events and<br\/>releases, Craig readily admits that when he started the label he was hoping \u201cit<br\/>would last forever.\u201d He cites artistic freedom as the highlight of running the label<br\/>and adds, \u201cIt was never a struggle for the label to be an outlet for my or other<br\/>people's music. It was always a struggle to stay in business, actually a war to stay<br\/>in business.\u201d<\/p> <p>:: DOWNSTAIRS ::<\/p> <p>CARL CRAIG<\/p> <p>CHAD SPIGNER<\/p> <p>MATT MCNEILL<\/p> <p>21+<br\/>Party by CSC<br\/>Visuals by Jon Von Bonk<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1593897024269328\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1593897024269328\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonEDM\/events\/227829162\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"CSC presents SWEET SHOP w\/ CARL CRAIG","id":"227829162","time":1452999600000,"updated":1453139554000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1196924921000,"name":"Boston Electronic Dance Music","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":861021,"urlname":"BostonEDM","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"EDM Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","city":"Somerville","phone":"(617) 591-2100","address_1":"65 Holland Street","name":"Orleans","lon":-71.123784,"id":1020328,"state":"MA","lat":42.398326,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.82215952873,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445281914000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Be All You Can Be!

Negative or traumatic experiences, stress, unexpressed emotion, fear, anger, resentment or self-limiting beliefs can become \u201cstuck\u201d (or suppressed) in the body and inhibit or disrupt the flow of vital life force at a cellular level. These energy blockages limit our experience of life and can result in a lack of spontaneity, energy depletion, a feeling of unrest, agitation or dis-ease.\u00a0<\/p> <p>IET uses a unique Cellular Memory Map\u00ae to target specific areas in the body where these \u201ccellular memories\u201d are stored, helping to release them on all levels \u2013 physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. As these blocks are cleared, your energy field is re-balanced. The more your energy body opens and vital life force can flow freely through it, the closer you move to a natural state of being: pure joy.<\/p> <p>Our IET training classes are each powerful days of self-healing and energy therapy certification training. In each class, you will be attuned to a powerful angelic energy ray that activates your 12-strand Spiritual DNA. You will then learn how to heartlink to the energy of your angels and use their energy for healing.

Before you say \u201cfrom the tap,\u201d think again. It had to get to the tap from somewhere. But where? And how?<\/p> <p>That\u2019s where we come in.<\/p> <p>The Waterworks Museum is located on the site of the original Chestnut Hill Reservoir and pumping station. By the 1880\u2019s, Boston\u2019s water system couldn\u2019t keep up with the rapid growth of the city and its water needs. Chestnut Hill was identified as the location for a new reservoir and main pumping station. The original station was built in 1887, but by the 1890\u2019s, it was clear that demand had quickly outstripped the ability to transport sufficient water. The need for more water resulted in the installation of increasingly powerful (and enormous!) pumping engines, which operated every day until the 1970\u2019s, when the site was taken offline, and Boston\u2019s water supply shifted to the Quabbin Reservoir. The Chestnut Hill Reservoir, however, is still used as a back-up source of water in case of emergencies.<\/p> <p>So why visit us?<\/p> <p>We tell some important regional stories about clean water, health, people, brilliant engineers, and magnificent architecture. Our stories tell how Boston grew to be the city it is today.<\/p> <p>You can explore the remarkable machinery, wonder at the massive wrenches that kept the pumps running, and marvel at the beautiful architecture.

It's quite another to learn to curtsy and throw a knife at the same time. Welcome to Finishing School.<\/i><\/p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is a great trial to her poor mother. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper manners--and the family can only hope that company never sees her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. So she enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality.<\/p> <p>But Sophronia soon realizes the school is not quite what her mother might have hoped. At Mademoiselle Geraldine's, young ladies learn to finish...everything. Certainly, they learn the fine arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but they also learn to deal out death, diversion, and espionage--in the politest possible ways, of course.

Victoria is Queen. Charles Darwin\u2019s son is Prime Minister. And steam is the power that runs the world. At 17, Claire Trevelyan, daughter of Viscount St. Ives, was expected to do nothing more than pour an elegant cup of tea, sew a fine seam, and catch a rich husband. Unfortunately, Claire\u2019s talents lie not in the ballroom, but in the chemistry lab, where things have a regrettable habit of blowing up. When her father gambles the estate on the combustion engine and loses, Claire finds herself down and out on the mean streets of London. But being a young woman of resources and intellect, she turns fortune on its head. It\u2019s not long before a new leader rises in the underworld, known only as the Lady of Devices . . . When she meets Andrew Malvern, a member of the Royal Society of Engineers, she realizes her talents may encompass more than the invention of explosive devices. They may help her realize her dreams and his . . . if they can both stay alive long enough to see that sometimes the closest friendships can trigger the greatest betrayals . . .<\/p> <p><b>This Monstrous Thing by Mackenzi Lee <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/c\/event_444301596.jpegIn\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/c\/event_444301596.jpegIn<\/a> 1818 Geneva, men built with clockwork parts live hidden away from society, cared for only by illegal mechanics called Shadow Boys.

No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating. We have lots of resources that we can suggest for learning ASL from a qualified teacher or authentic source, such as books, online classes, and local classes at various locations near Boston.<\/p> <p>If you can, \"officially\" RSVP, even if the RSVP is \"No,\" so that we know who is definitely going to come.<\/p> <p>It will be great to see folks!<\/p> <p>Sean<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be there signing our beautiful language to inspire all of you!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonasl\/events\/227909977\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"ASL WEEKLY SOCIAL","id":"zfccmlyvcbwb","time":1453064400000,"updated":1453073692000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1223604065000,"name":"Boston ASL","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1298565,"urlname":"bostonasl","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"ASL Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02124","country":"us","city":"Dorchester","address_1":"80 Talbot  Ave","name":"The Carver Den","lon":-71.083761,"id":836082,"state":"MA","lat":42.293667,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.64612483978,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451440099000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/5\/0\/600_442915376.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"On the dance floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Steppers-of-Boston\/events\/227707206\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Carver Den - Step it Up","id":"227707206","time":1453064400000,"updated":1453076779000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1229737841000,"name":"The Original Steppers of Boston Inc. 2006","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1340809,"urlname":"Steppers-of-Boston","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Original Steppers of Boston"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":8.15622138977,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447187590000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>To be a vegetarian is good for your body and soul!

This is not a vegetarian event, so if you have an amazing Italian Wedding Soup recipe, make it! <b>To the vegetarian members of the group, mark your calendars for February 21. <\/b>I'm planning a Vegetarian Chili Exchange for that day. <b>NOTE :: <\/b>Once you know what soup you want to make, please post it in the comments section. This will help avoid duplication and inspire a better variety of soups.<\/p> <p><br\/>2.<b> Containers<\/b>. Since I consider myself a seasoned swapper of soups, I find that the 4 cup twist top storage containers are PERFECT for traveling and storing in the fridge or freezer. Plus, 4 cups of soup makes for a lovely dinner for 2 (or an individual lunch and dinner). See image below. You can easily find these containers at the grocery store or places like Target.<b> Remember to buy the 32 ounce size. <\/b>NOTE :: You may want to lightly wash them before filling them with soup. Sometimes the new plastic smell is overwhelming.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/2\/5\/600_445724581.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>3.<b> How much to bring?<\/b> Now that we're all on the same page with the soup containers, let's discuss how many containers to prepare. Each person is asked to bring a MINIMUM of 8 containers \u2014 <b>6 for swapping + 1 for donating + 1 for sampling<\/b>. You are welcome to bring more than 7 containers, if you're feeling ambitious enough\u2014go for it! Essentially, whatever amount you bring for swapping, that's the amount of soups you'll be bringing home. For example, if you bring 10 containers for swapping, you'll leave with 10 different soups! <b>NOTE :: <\/b>Even though 20-30 of us will be coming together for this event, you do NOT have to bring 20-30 containers of soups\u2014that's cray cray (but awesome).<\/p> <p><br\/>4.<b> Sampling the soups.<\/b> We're going to have chafing platters set out to display our soups for easy sampling. <b>No crockpots needed<\/b>. One less thing to carry . . . hooray (plus the tables won't be near an electrical outlet). So, of the 8+ containers you're bringing, set one aside for sampling. I'll give you a bowl and a label to fill out. There will be plenty of\u00a0 spoons and chips for tasting the soups. <b>NOTE :: You don't have to bring a copy of your recipe, but I do ask that each of you write down a list of all the ingredients. <\/b>This will be super helpful for everyone involved. Thanks!<\/p> <p><br\/>5. <b>Swapping rules.<\/b> Though there will be a great variety of soups for this event, you will most likely NOT be bringing every type of soup home. If you brought 6 containers for swapping, you will be choosing 6 different soups to take home. During the \"tasting\" part of the event, you will be making note of the soups you'd like to potentially swap (almost like you're shopping for soups). <b>NOTE :: <\/b>There's no guarantee you're going to get the exact soups you want. It's up to the other person to decide if they want to take YOUR soup home, too. I know, it sounds confusing. I'll explain everything at the event. But trust me . . . it's going to be fun and no one will go home empty-handed!<\/p> <p>6. Empty-handed. That leads me to the <b>charitable<\/b> part of the event. With the abundance of incredible food we'll be sharing together, I felt compelled to have each of us donate a container of soup for those in need. So, I've connected with 2 local families to whom we'll be giving our soups (and a gift basket of goodies from Prime Meats &amp; Provisions). The following Monday, I'll drive to their houses to deliver the food. This small gesture will make a huge impact on these families. <b>Thank you for doing your part to make this donation possible.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/primemeatsandprovisions.com\/\">Prime Meats &amp; Provisions<\/a><\/b> is the venue for our soup swap.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

For this year we\u2019ll do a loop hike along the eastern, lesser traveled section of the Skyline Trail from Shea Rink in Quincy to Chickatawbut Hill and back. This hike will be on Martin Luther King Day, Monday January 18th at 10AM. The Skyline Trail is a strenuous and rugged trail that transects the Blue Hills Reservation from east to west. The summits of the numerous hills offer incredible views of downtown Boston, the Harbor Islands and the surrounding communities. Please consider joining L.L. Bean Mansfield on this challenging excursion. The full hike should run over 3 hours and cover over 6 miles. I\u2019ll check trail conditions the day before and let everyone know what special equipment they\u2019ll need to bring (snowshoes, traction devices, trekking poles, etc). We will do a shorter hike if trail and weather conditions are less than optimal.<br\/>Please dress appropriately for the weather conditions. Dressing in layers works best.<br\/>Wear appropriate footwear for hiking. Please bring water, snacks and any personal medicines and gear you may need as well. These outings are free but you are responsible to have everything you need.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Thank you!<\/p> <p>FAQs<\/p> <p>Who does our service benefit?\n<br\/>Your helping hands help thousands of Cambridge (and Somerville) families in need. Last year we made more than 500 fleece scarves and blankets for homeless children, teens and adults; more than 2400 Valentines for isolated elders, veterans, troops overseas and homeless parents and 1500 activity kits for children waiting in hospital emergency rooms. We collected and distributed more than 500 grocery bags of food to 12 local food pantries, dozens of bags of winter clothes to shelters and dozens of bags of childrens' books to local literacy programs. We reached approximately 7000 vulnerable children, teens and adults in our community.<\/p> <p>Can we bring kids?<br\/>\nYes! We've designed the projects to encourage even the littlest hands to be able to participate. We have had children as young as 2 and seniors 90+ lend their generous hands in service.<\/p> <p>What are my transport\/parking options getting to the event?\n<br\/>The best way to come is by MBTA. We're in Central Square on the Red Line. The #1 Mass Ave bus stops across from City Hall. There are some public parking lots nearby as well. Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?<br\/>\nPlease feel free to email us at [masked]. We'll be in touch soon!<\/p> <p>Can I bring a group from my company, church, school, sports team, Girl Scout troop, etc?\n<br\/>Absolutely! Please contact us as soon as you can (ideally by January 15), so we can be sure to place you together.

Over the long term, I would like to see several members assume event host positions that specialize in particular mystical traditions. More than one student-member can specialize in the same topic but we would clearly benefit with some diversification and pluralism in the field. For example, I plan on focusing on the Kabbalah, but it would be very acceptable if others choose to concentrate on the same tradition.<\/p> <p>Diversification and focus is the key. We will benefit by various student-members who specialize in different aspects of mysticism. At the same time,\u00a0 having more than one student-member concentrating on the same area will only deepen understanding. I mentioned that I will focus on the Kabbalah, but I fully intend to branch out into other areas as well. My sense of mysticism is that it possesses\u2014perhaps more than any other area of study,\u00a0 a deep complementarity that embraces a wide range of ostensibly different traditions that are also deeply similar in their essence. I realize that I have made a broad generalization, and generalization can be dangerous! But if our pursuit of the different mystical traditions is done with an attitude of loving intention\u2014which I believe is at the heart of mysticism, then failure to pursue what the heart may yearn may be the greater danger.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'm the guy in the picture","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Philosophizers\/events\/227425721\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Mysticism Study Group","id":"227425721","time":1453161600000,"updated":1453217598000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1304716937000,"name":"Social Philosophizers","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1826065,"urlname":"Social-Philosophizers","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Philosophizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Somerville","address_1":"17 Holland St","name":"Johnny D's","lon":-71.122841,"id":23552572,"lat":42.397369,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.74138021469,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452714372000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NEW YEAR, NEW WILD MEMORY NATION!<\/p> <p>Folks, we see the new year in strong with our very first Wild Memory Nation of the year.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/228047694\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvcbxb","time":1453163400000,"updated":1453239831000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"Davis Sq","address_2":"Davis Sq","name":"Johnny D's","lon":-71.122551,"id":849803,"state":"MA","lat":42.396507,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.68948578835,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450026223000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>One of our members (thanks, Diane!) has done this and said it's fun.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right.
