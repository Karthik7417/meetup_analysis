The vibe, the music, the drinks, the staff, THE FOOD! I wish they took reservations for less than 6 people Bc we love to go but it's so busy we are never sure if there will be a table. Everything I've ever had has been cooked perfectly. I've always been satisfied. Oh, and stickabutta pie of course...don't leave without dessert.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We want for brunch for the first time. Small plates, so filling and delicious.pork belly and biscuits and the egg in a jar were on point. And everything else we ate. Go to The Cookery. You will not be disappointed.\"<\/p> <p>Another said, \"\u00a0Cauliflower is an awful, ridiculous, unneeded vegetable that tastes like crap ... and The Cookery's cauliflower ravioli might be the best thing on the menu. That's how good this place is.<\/p> <p>In two visits, I've had eight appetizers and three entrees (that's not a typo, by the way) and each one somehow was better than the last; topped by the cauliflower ravioli, I have no idea how they made that terrible vegetable taste so good.<\/p> <p>What I like most about the place, though, is how they manage to have one of the best restaurants in the area and it kinda-sorta looks like they aren't even trying. Many spots in the area have a shtick or a motif and that's fine. However, it is hilarious to see a restaurant put out such a great product as the Cookery does while totally not taking itself too seriously.\"<\/p> <p>And one more said, \"How does he do it? Chef Dave just keeps the hits coming, from innovative creations like the fried chickpea appetizer, amazing bitter greens salad and second-to-none pasta dishes. The Lamb Bolognese is as good as the first day I fell in love with it, as well as the cauliflower ravioli and butternut squash lasagne. Eyeball-rolling good!\u00a0I just love this place.

Edgar has lived in Guatemala his entire life and has produced an exceptional photographic coffee table book on the country\u2019s friendly people and colorful places. Edgar is very proud of his country and is excited to welcome visitors and show the many faces of Guatemala.<\/p> <p>Edgar has created a tour that focuses on three main concepts: color, culture and traditions. It aims to portray basic aspects of Guatemalan culture so you can appreciate it as an observer. You will create images of unique moments that involve people, traditions and history.<\/p> <p><b>March 13-20, 2016 <\/b><br\/><b>Early registration by Nov. 1 is $2,879.<\/b> Regular Price: $3,479.<br\/>Rate is for double occupancy. Single supplement: $750.<br\/>Non-photographers: $400 discount.<\/p> <p>We start in the city of Antigua, which is less than an hour drive from the main airport in Guatemala City. Our base in Antigua is the Casa Santo Domingo, a five star hotel that is a converted convent. If we didn\u2019t leave the hotel grounds we\u2019d make amazing pictures, but Edgar has us going to photograph colonial ruins, a volcano, convents and a colorful craft market. We will travel to other towns visiting Mayan communities, a coffee plantation, meeting people in their natural environment making crafts and clothes and we\u2019ll be photographing unique ceremonies. We will take a boat to visit towns around a large lake, where the scenery is spectacular. (See the full itinerary below).<\/p> <p>There are few countries left in the world where people live their historic culture, where they wear the traditional clothing of their ancestors on a daily basis and not just on special occasions. Guatemala is such a place. Guatemala is a living culture, full of people enjoying their colorful environment and traditions dating back to their Mayan ancestors and the colonial period.<\/p> <p>As you are photographing beautiful Guatemala, Loren and Edgar will be working with you to ensure you get the best photographs of your life. We will offer tips on how to approach people, how to get candid photos, seeing and working with Guatemala\u2019s unique light and strengthening your images with better composition. You will get instant feedback on your photography.<\/p> <p>We will be out shooting early and staying out late to capture the best light of the day. We will take breaks for rest and dining during the day.<\/p> <p>All of your Guatemalan arrangements will be made for you. We will meet you at the airport on Sunday and book your room in fine hotels. We will be traveling together in one van with Edgar at the wheel. He knows the areas we are visiting quite well and we\u2019ll stop whenever a photo opportunity arises.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/lorenphotos.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/edgar_arches610-366x500.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Being a tourist in Guatemala <\/b><br\/>You will need a valid passport but no special visa if you are staying less than 90 days. Electricity is 120V as in United States, so you don\u2019t need special electrical adapters. All the hotels have Internet service and there is cellular phone coverage in the areas we are staying. The money exchange rate is very favorable for the tourist, right now it is 7.70 quetzales per dollar. There are areas of Guatemala that are not safe for tourists, mostly on the border with Mexico. We won\u2019t be going anywhere near there. But like any other place, tourists can be targets, so you want to make sure you are careful and don\u2019t flaunt your camera gear.

You should have shorts, jeans and comfortable clothes, a hat or cap and some casual clothes for night. It\u2019s very rare to have rain in March.<\/p> <p><b>Dining: <\/b><br\/>Breakfast each day is included, it may be after a sunrise shoot. You are responsible for other dining expenses. We will be on the move but taking breaks to enjoy the scenery and dining.<\/p> <p><b>Hotel: <\/b><br\/>Hotel accommodation costs are included. You may want to tip the friendly service.<\/p> <p><b>Photo Equipment:<\/b><br\/>You\u2019ll want to have a wide angle, telephoto and possibly a macro lens. Make sure you have lots of memory cards, spare batteries and charger and maybe a polarizer filter. I\u2019m a tripod shooter, but we will be in lots of markets, churches and areas where a tripod may not be appropriate. But I\u2019m bringing a travel tripod. I also suggest bringing a laptop to download your photos and a way to have a backup, either on the original cards or an external hard drive. If you aren\u2019t absolutely sure of everything that your camera does, bring your instruction manual so I can help you fix any problems.<\/p> <p><b>Payment:<\/b> The full fee is required 120 days prior to the workshop.<\/p> <p><b>Deposits and Cancellations: <\/b><br\/>A $750 deposit must be paid in order to secure your space in our workshop. Full payment must be received 120 days prior to the workshop.<\/p> <p>I must receive notice of your cancellation in writing, at which time I offer the following refunds:<br\/>120 days or more before workshop: Full workshop or deposit refund.<br\/>119 to 60 days before workshop: 50% of workshop cost.<br\/>59 or fewer days before workshop: no refund. If you must forfeit your workshop fee we will refund your full payment, minus the deposit, if I can fill your spot.

Workshops are sold as a package only.<\/p> <p>If a workshop is cancelled, you will receive a full refund of any money paid, but I\u2019d have to be on my deathbed before I\u2019d cancel. But if I\u2019m on my deathbed and need to cancel the workshop, I will not be held responsible for your other expenses, such as airline ticket, that may be associated with the canceled workshop.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

As vegetarians\/vegans, we are living in a world where the majority of people are either blind to the truth or simply ignore it. We know the truth, we have chosen to change our lifestyle because of what we know, and now it is our duty to speak up and educate others. If we are silent, we are not helping to advance the movement.

We'll meet up at the Hoboken PATH station and start with a brief discussion during which experienced leafleters will give tips and answer questions. We will also discuss chalking and give examples of things to write\/draw. Then, we will divide into three groups and spread out across Hoboken, targeting places like Church Square Park, Columbus Park, and Maxwell Place Park. Each group will have some members leaflet while others are writing the chalk messages. As people show an interest in what the \"chalkers\" are doing, the leafleters can hand out information and discuss our group and our purpose. We will also leaflet as we are walking to our destinations (probably down Washington Street as there is heavy foot traffic there).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/8\/a\/600_447321898.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The leafleting\/chalking will last for 1.5-2 hours. Afterwards, we'll head to a local establishment to grab a bite to eat and socialize. We'll also discuss what we learned, what was positive, what was challenging, and how we can improve in the future. The whole event should be done in about 3 hours. Come for the whole thing, or pick which part you want to attend and just come for that part. If you are not sure you are ready to leaflet and\/or chalk, please feel free to still join and just hang out with us and learn. Maybe you'll be ready the next time! It is our hope that we can raise awareness in Hoboken and hopefully meet new vegans\/vegetarians in the process!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/a\/2\/600_447321922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Note:<\/b> While we welcome all veg types, this event is about promoting veganism, so please remember to advocate for veganism when chalking or and\/or speaking to others, even if you are not vegan.<\/p> <p>Let's get out there and be voices for animals!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/8\/8\/600_447322152.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-JC-Vegan-Activist-Meetup\/events\/229126522\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Vegan Activism - Leafleting and Chalking","id":"229126522","time":1457888400000,"updated":1457901712000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1456357033000,"name":"Hoboken & JC Vegan Activist Meetup","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":19621296,"urlname":"Hoboken-JC-Vegan-Activist-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"EARTHlings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Exact Location Disclosed On Ticket","name":"Westchester","lon":-74.005943,"id":24306549,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457380751000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Learn how to make scrubs, candle melts and diffusers!

Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.calleochonyc.com\/menu\/brunch\/\">menu<\/a>, and get ready for a fantastic, and what will be sure to be a FUN (with not only a capital F, but a capital UN as well!) brunch! \u00a0The free sangria is served while we are still eating, so we don't need to rush through the meal (although they do have a 3 hour time limit). \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The reservation time is for 2:15 p.m. \u00a0Please arrive by 2 pm\u00a0<b>at the latest<\/b>. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Here are their brunch \"rules\"<\/p> <p>BRUNCH HOUSE RULES\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Please enjoy one glass of sangria at a time. Don\u2019t worry, there is plenty more where that came from!<\/p> <p>\u2022 Complimentary sangria is served during the course of your meal, not forever (unfortunately)! If that last bite of burrito has been sitting on your plate for 3 hours, you\u2019re kind of toeing the line of \u201cforever.\"<\/p> <p>\u2022 If one person gets cut off, so does the rest of your table. So please ask your boyfriend to save his awesome tabletop dancing skills for another day.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Management reserves the right to discontinue serving any patron at any time. (Boring, we know -- our lawyers made us put this one in).<\/p> <p>\u2022 Sangria is served in 20 oz. glasses, so don\u2019t be sad if you don\u2019t get to all the flavors. We still think you\u2019re a champ!<\/p> <p>\u2022 No sangria is allowed outside the restaurant.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Please don\u2019t forget your children here. We WILL put them to work.<\/p> <p>\u2022 We encourage our guests to enjoy a fun, leisurely sangria brunch, but please also be mindful of our additional reservations. Your fellow brunchers would also like to enjoy the sangria (and perhaps a bite to eat).<\/p> <p>\u2022 Please drink responsibly.<\/p> <p>HAVE FUN AND ENJOY!<\/p> <p><i>This event will be for My New Friend members only. \u00a0No guests. \u00a0So if you have someone that you want to come, they will need to sign up for the group and RSVP for themselves.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"An email will be sent out before the meetup to those attending.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/My_New_Friends\/events\/228865306\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH!!!","id":"228865306","time":1457892900000,"updated":1457966804000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1400194011000,"name":"!

But if you're like me, it takes some hands on experience to really get to learn something. So I present to you . . . . . Part II of the Long Exposure Workshop!<\/p> <p>After part one of the workshop, there's ample time to clear your schedule, check to see what gear you have and what gear you need, look up some of the photography terms online and get yourself ready to put all that knowledge to use. We will meet at the corner of Delancey Street and Pitt Street in Manhattan, close to the Williamsburg Bridge. Once there, we will walk over to the East River Promenade and get out gear ready for a view of the sky, East River, Williamsburg Bridge and the people walking along the promenade. Here, you can make clouds stretch across the sky, make water turn smooth as silk, get light trails from the cars on the bridge and make people on the promenade disappear. (Don't you wish you could really do that with a camera???)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll get there BEFORE sunset so we can look around the area, set up shots and capture the sunset over the bridge. Then, we can get some really long exposures when the sunlight is completely gone. This is when you can get into the rhythm of setting up your camera for long exposures. I will wait until the morning of the 13th to see if the weather forecast calls for rain. If the chances of rain are over <b>40%<\/b>, I will reschedule the MeetUp. Hope to see you all there!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Night photography and long exposures are always better with tripods, however we will be located in a place with pedestrian traffic. \u00a0If you have a strong, table-top tripod or gorilla pod, those would be handy. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Don't forget your charged batteries and empty memory cards. If you have any lens filters, those may also come in handy.<\/p> <p>\u2022 As always, please be on time.

Animals are enslaved, abused and forced to spend their dismal, horrendous lives engaging in behaviors wholly unnatural to them, performing under constant threat of pain and punishment by this ravenous cash machine of a \"circus\". and get treated like garbage even as those who survive all the horror, a joyless life of mechanistic use and abuse, approach convalescence.<\/p> <p>Again,\u00a0we will have signs, leaflets and relevant props. If you have something you want to bring, that's fine, but all you NEED to bring is YOURSELF, a heart full of empathy\/compassion and a voice to demonstrate your love for pachyderms, primates, bears, big cats, all creatures great and small.<\/p> <p>Blessed be ALL animals, FIGHT for their rights!!!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/2\/2\/event_89836162.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/228243800\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":9000000,"name":"**\"FAUN vs. Ringling: Animal Circus, Begone!\" demo @ Prudential in Newark, NJ!**","id":"228243800","time":1457902800000,"updated":1457997830000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457397439000,"fee":{"amount":10.6000003815,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/1\/3\/600_447343027.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/9\/f\/600_442236255.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We're back! \u00a0And we're better than ever. \u00a0Our gym is brand new with NBA Stars like Lebron James and Stephen Curry participating in the ribbon cutting ceremony. \u00a0We're hosting an open run for only $10 for basketball at our brand new facilities. \u00a0Sign up before all the spots are taken!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ABCHoops\/events\/229424126\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":7200000,"name":"Indoor Basketball Full Court Pick Up!","id":"229424126","time":1457902800000,"updated":1457910982000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1327992578000,"name":"ABC Hoops - Indoor Pickup Basketball","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3202582,"urlname":"ABCHoops","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"ABC Hoopers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"257 West 39th Street #14E","name":"Champions Studios","lon":-73.990364,"id":12271242,"state":"NY","lat":40.755238,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":0.362980991602,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1416324253000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A chance to refine skills and practice push hands with a diverse group of martial artists.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"When you get to Champions look for a posting for \"tai chi\" to see what room we're in.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Mid-TownTaijiquan-Push-Hands-Meetup\/events\/229394836\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Push hands","id":"pndrclyvfbrb","time":1457902800000,"updated":1457910979000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1415305443000,"name":"NYC Mid-Town Taijiquan Push Hands","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18120272,"urlname":"New-York-Mid-TownTaijiquan-Push-Hands-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11101","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Astoria","address_1":"3801 35th Ave","name":"Panera","lon":-73.94139,"id":888618,"state":"NY","lat":40.76373,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":2.72075843811,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1438571727000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>5:00-5:15: Requisite fifteen minute schmoozing.<br\/>5:15-6:15: We write for an hour, a la the \"Shut Up &amp; Write\" meetups.<br\/>6:15-6:25: Replenish mind and body after intense and gratifying writing session via the ordering of food and drink.<br\/>6:25-8:00: We critique, in a a supportive way, two pieces from group members.

As part of HVRW, we will enjoy a 3 course meal at this five star restaurant for $29.95 plus tax, tip and drinks.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0Overlooking the Hudson River and the Palisades, Havest's Tuscan Farmhouse is one of the most beautiful restaurants in the New York Area. Garden and patio dining, sunset views, a comfortable lounge and a 30-foot high stone fireplace make the Harvest a perfect choice for any event.<\/p> <p>The Mediterranean cuisine prepared by Chef Vincent Barcelona is centered on Italy and includes foods and flavors from throughout the region. Their garden provides dozens of varieties of Heirloom tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and other vegetables and herbs\u2014all of which find their way into Vincent's cooking.<\/p> <p>I will post the menu when it is published but for now you can check out their website to view the regular menu:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.harvesthudson.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.harvesthudson.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.harvesthudson.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Here are comments from prior diners:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Harvest serves Italian food with general Mediterranean influences - their menu categories are pretty basic, but some standouts are a variety of artisan pizzas and pastas - plus a selection of cured meats and cheeses and a raw bar. On my most recent trip I decided to start with the crispy artichoke - it was flavorful and the leaves were fried nicely. It came with shaved parmesan and a lemon wedge which complimented the flavor of the artichoke well. For my main I had the shrimp bruschetta which was out of this world - large shrimp served with white beans and cherry tomatoes in a lemon butter sauce served on top of a grilled country bread. The flavors were amazing, and they didn't skimp on the shrimp which I appreciated. For dessert I had the peanut butter ice cream cake - you can taste the peanut butter without it being overbearing, it was the perfect finisher.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I know other reviews cite the service as a weak spot but I've never had a bad experience with it. Harvest is probably my favorite Westchester restaurant on the river and one I will return to time and again.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Another said, \"My fianc\u00e9e and I came here for Valentine's Day and not only is the food amazing, but 5 stars for the ambiance and service. They had a 3-course meal. I ordered the Caesar salad and wow was it amazing. And for entree, I got the chicken scarpariello and it was delicious. My fianc\u00e9e got the short rib and it was melting in our mouths! Definitely make sure you come here and you won't be disappointed.\"<\/p> <p>And one more reported,\"This is a beautiful restaurant on some prime real-estate!\u00a0Went for restaurant week dinner sunday evening and it was a pretty dusk light that filled the interior. Started w a drink at the bar. Bartenders were helpful, knowledgable and accommodating. Had the mule, it was delicious!<br\/>Sat by the window for dinner, pretty views and calming atmosphere. Apps were the Cesar salad for my bf, carpaccio for me. The carpaccio was very delicious paired w the zucchini and cheese it comes w. Entrees were short rib and pork milenesse. Short ribs were better than the pork by far! Desserts were the chocolate and the grape desserts. Both were delicious and a nice ending.

In the opening pages of The Rent Collector, Sang Ly\u2019s grandfather promises that it will be a very lucky day. What role do you think luck plays in our lives? How does the idea of luck reconcile with the novel\u2019s epigraph, the quote from Buddha on the opening page?<\/p> <p>\u00a02. After reading Sarann (the Cambodian Cinderella), Sopeap and Sang Ly discuss how story plots repeat, reinforcing the same lessons. Sopeap calls resurfacing plots \u201cperplexing\u201d and then asks, \u201cIs our DNA to blame for this inherent desire to hope? Is it simply another survival mechanism? Is that why we love Sarann or Cinderella? Or is there more to it?\u201d How would you answer? What are possible explanations for the phenomenon?<\/p> <p>\u00a03. Sang Ly says that living at the dump is a life where \u201cthe hope of tomorrow is traded to satisfy the hunger of today.\u201d How might this statement also apply to those with modern homes, late-model cars, plentiful food, and general material abundance?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. Sang Ly mentions that Lucky Fat has an \u201cuncanny knack of finding money lost amongst the garbage.\u201d Do you suppose someone may have been helping him by placing money for him to find? If so, who?<\/p> <p>\u00a05. Speaking of her clock, Sang Ly says, \u201cSometimes broken things deserve to be repaired.\u201d What might she be referring to more than the clock?\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. The shelters at Stung Meanchey are built to protect the resting pickers from the sun. What other purposes do they serve? What \u201cshelters\u201d do we build in our own lives? How would you react if the \u201cshelters\u201d in your life were constantly being torn down?\u00a0<\/p> <p>7. At first, Ki is reluctant to welcome change, specifically to see Sang Ly learn to read. He says, \u201cI know that we don\u2019t have a lot here, but at least we know where we stand.\u201d What do you think he means? When have you found it hard to accept change?<\/p> <p>\u00a08. Sopeap tells Sang Ly: \u201cTo understand literature, you read it with your head, but you interpret it with your heart. The two are forced to work together\u2014and, quite frankly, they often don\u2019t get along.\u201d Do you agree? Can you think of examples?<\/p> <p>\u00a09. Koah Kchol, or scraping, is an ancient remedy Sang Ly says has been practiced in her family for generations. Do you have your own family remedies that have been passed down? What are they, and do they work?<\/p> <p>\u00a010. Sang Ly and Sopeap discuss dreams. Have you ever had a dream that changed your attitude, decisions, or outlook? Was it a subconscious occurrence or something more?\u00a0<\/p> <p>11. In a moment of reflection, Sang Ly admits that she doesn\u2019t mean to be a skeptic, to lack hope, or to harbor fear. However, she notes that experience has been her diligent teacher. She asks, \u201cGrandfather, where is the balance between humbly accepting our life\u2019s trials and pleading toward heaven for help, begging for a better tomorrow?\u201d How would you answer her question?<\/p> <p>\u00a012. Sang Ly speaks often to her deceased grandfather, but not to her father, until after her meeting with the Healer. Why did her attitude change? How might the same principle apply to relationships in our own lives?\u00a0<\/p> <p>13. Sopeap always wears thick brown socks, no matter the weather. As Sopeap lies dying, Sang Ly notices that the socks have slipped, exposing scars on Sopeap\u2019s ankles. How would you presume Sopeap got these scars? How might Sopeap\u2019s scars (or rather their source) have influenced her appreciation for the story of the rising Phoenix? In what ways does Sopeap rise from her own ashes, literally and figuratively?<\/p> <p>\u00a014. The story ends with Sang Ly retelling the myth of Vadavamukha and the coming of Sopeap to Stung Meanchey.

Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/229460068\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup at Stand Up New York Free admission 2 drnk min","id":"229460068","time":1457912700000,"updated":1457925613000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213936546000,"name":"Free NYC!

The methodology he developed in 1993 and formalized in 1995 with Ken Schwaber has since been adopted by the vast majority of software development companies around the world. But Jeff realized that the benefits of Scrum are not limited to software and product development. He has adapted this successful strategy for several other industries including: finance, healthcare, higher education and telecom.<\/p> <p>As the CEO of Scrum Inc. and the Senior Advisor and Agile Coach to OpenView Venture Partners, Jeff sets the vision for success with Scrum. He continues to share best practices with organizations around the globe and has written extensively on Scrum rules and methods.

His original lyrics to 'Stolen Moments,' 'Red Clay' and more are known the world over. His innovative projects range from the work of Nat 'King' Cole to Jack Kerouac to Ivan Lins and Eddie Jefferson. Stereo Review dubbed Mark 'one of the major artists of our age.' 'For decades the question 'What exactly is a jazz singer' 'has had two easy answers, Betty Carter and Mark Murphy.' wrote the New York Post. 'He was arguably the best male jazz singer in the business,' declared Rex Reed.<\/p> <p>The event is co-produced by Ari Silverstein, a New York impresario and founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FNYCJazzTour.com%2F&amp;h=qAQHa8KBuAQHkXriN1TihVfUar6PpzS2jERCmj7DkvSt5YA&amp;enc=AZNqNHaU1_2D4CNaJHHyLsuhrXY3wcd79rM-LkI42Z4aFzRDQr_kLrLSbgiaAPN79EJ74Or5pJ_XB_892jXx7p-i5PHxbFUUAwDTaVIUQCltAQEwp1zKiKstFPGn9icjucHTVhuuawhggFvaxWPFdmqx_KDQUSM5kNG-r0Mm1Cqc3g&amp;s=1\">NYCJazzTour.com<\/a>, and Jean-Pierre Leduc, founder of Lunched Management &amp; Booking, and Murphy\u2019s last manager. \u201cWe wanted to make Mark\u2019s first birthday since his passing a memorable one, an evening worthy of the man himself,\u201d said co-producer Silverstein. \u201cThere is a distinct line between those considered artists and those who are considered innovators. Mark was the latter, pushing boundaries and the standards for the sub-genres of jazz, for example his inclusion of poetry, book readings, highly original scat solos or his own lyrics. Everything Mark touched he truly made his own.\u201d<\/p> <p>Leduc observed that, \u201cwhile Mark was underappreciated by the music business at large, and the general public too, for that matter, every astute singer idolized this giant, and was regularly amazed by his artistry on recordings and his magnetism and charisma on stage. In his later years, this gift was undiminished, as countless dazzled audiences will attest.\u201d Leduc added that he expects the event to be cathartic, too, as it will be \u201cthe first opportunity to collectively and publicly grieve Mark\u2019s passing.\u201d<\/p> <p>Living legend and jazz vocalist Sheila Jordan adds, \u201cMark Murphy was like a kid brother to me. I loved his caring, his sense of humor and his wonderful singing. His music will live forever.\u201d Wendy Oxenhorn, director of the Jazz Foundation of America, was also a dear friend, saying \"Mark Murphy is and will always be on a planet of his own.\u00a0<br\/>Unreachable. Few flew as high. His ballads were untouchable. Mark was a bird alone, like Abbey, Chet and Jimmy Scott.\u201d Oxenhorn adds, \u201cMark was one of the greatest abstract expressionist vocalists that ever roamed the earth. This Celebration of Life will give us the chance to send him off with our gratitude for the freedom, the grace, the love and the space he gave us to fly with him.\u201d<\/p> <p>The producers acknowledge the invaluable assistance of The Jazz Foundation Of America.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Practical information about the event:<br\/>Memorial Concert Celebrating the Life and Music of Mark Howe Murphy March 14, 2016.<br\/>Reception at 6:00 pm; Concert at 7:00 pm<\/p> <p>The Sanctuary at St. Peter\u2019s Church, 619 Lexington Avenue (Entrance on E 54th St.) Admission is free; space is limited; seating is first come, first serve.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Photographs of Mark Murphy, as well as interviews with Mr Silverstein, with Mr Leduc or Ms Oxenhorn, are available upon request.

Lewis. The thought behind the book study is that we have a healthy discussion. The hope is that the discussion won't be a debate, but more of a safe space for people to say their point of view and raise questions.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.\u00a0<br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses\u00a0<br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.\u00a0<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you\u00a0<br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind\u00a0<br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.\u00a0<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Wyckoff, one of the founding titans of technical analysis, developed a method in the early 20th century to anticipate future market direction by analyzing only price, volume and time. Many successful professional and institutional traders still rely on his principles of judging the market by its own action; Wyckoffs approach is as valid today as when it was first articulated and continues to work well for any freely traded security in any time frame.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Mr. Roman Bogomazov, an internationally recognized expert in the Wyckoff Method, will describe how to apply this approach for several different instruments in multiple time frames. He will demonstrate how Wyckoff-style analysis identifies high-probability opportunities in stocks, e-minis, and forex even in the volatile markets of the past year. The Wyckoff Method provides reliable signals regardless of a traders time horizon, as Mr. Bogomazov will illustrate with case studies using intra-day, daily and longer-term charts. Traders of all levels of skill and experience will definitely benefit from this presentation.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Stock-Investors-Wyckoff-Educational-Meetup\/events\/229290601\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":2700000,"name":"Applying the Wyckoff Method in Any Time Frame","id":"229290601","time":1458071100000,"updated":1458075329000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410723956000,"name":"NYC Stock Investors Wyckoff Educational Meetup","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":16990212,"urlname":"NYC-Stock-Investors-Wyckoff-Educational-Meetup","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Wyckoffians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"51 west 14TH ST #2R","lon":-73.996061,"phone":"212 929-3302","name":"PhotoManhattan","id":5973732,"state":"NY","lat":40.737016,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":0.95358890295,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":29,"created":1451178704000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for another one of our great classes, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.photomanhattan.com\/photography-workshops-nyc-s\/1896.htm\">Seminar Framing &amp; Composition: Mar 15, Tuesday 3:45 PM-5:45 PM.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn3.volusion.com\/ydugw.xtrfr\/v\/vspfiles\/photos\/CFB-SE-2T.jpg?1449931330\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cdn3.volusion.com\/ydugw.xtrfr\/v\/vspfiles\/photos\/CFB-SE-2T.jpg?1449931330<\/a><\/p> <p>Improve your imagery with this 2-hour seminar!

It is explained how money is created by the banking system as a whole and by individual banks. The role of central banks as system stabilizers and liquidity providers is elucidated. Both the Chicago Plan and the Free Banking Proposal are discussed. It is shown how in the process of money creation, banks become naturally interconnected. A novel Extended Structural Default Model describing the stability of the Interconnected Banking Network is proposed. The purpose of bank capital and liquidity is explained. A multi-period constrained optimization problem for a bank\u2019s balance sheet is formulated and solved in a simple case. Both theoretical and practical aspects are covered.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Alexander Lipton<\/b> is a Managing Director, Quantitative Solutions Executive at Bank of America, Visiting Professor of Quantitative Finance at University of Oxford and Advisory Board member at the Oxford-Man Institute.<\/p> <p>Prior to his current role, he was a Managing Director, Co-head of the Global Quantitative Group at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a Visiting Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College London. Earlier, he was a Managing Director and Head of Capital Structure Quantitative Research at Citadel Investment Group in Chicago; he has also worked for Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust. Before switching to finance, Alex was a Full Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois and a Consultant at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in pure mathematics from Moscow State University.<\/p> <p>Lipton\u2019s interests encompass all aspects of financial engineering, including large-scale bank balance sheet modeling and optimization, enterprise-wide holistic risk management and stress testing, CCPs, electronic trading, trading strategies, payment systems, theory of monetary circuit, as well as hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and astrophysics. Lipton authored two books, and edited five books, including, most recently, Risk Quant of the Year Award, Risk Books, London, 2014, and The Oxford Handbook of Credit Derivatives, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011 (with Andrew Rennie). He published more than a hundred scientific papers on a variety of topics in applied mathematics and financial engineering.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Disclaimer<\/b><\/p> <p>This a joint IAQF\/Thalesians seminar, and not an instructional program of New York University.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/thalesians\/events\/228350367\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":9900000,"name":"(NY) - Alexander Lipton - Modern Monetary Circuit Theory","id":"228350367","time":1458078300000,"updated":1458589521000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1239886472000,"name":"The Thalesians","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1435784,"urlname":"thalesians","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Thalesians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Rahway","address_1":"TBD","name":"Bill's Place","lon":-74.274361,"id":24016698,"state":"NJ","lat":40.60434,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.0175857544,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447895677000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>This event is currently at its maximum and is closed to new players.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>From humble beginnings, a handful of lost souls must rise above their misfortune to achieve greatness.<\/p> <p>The uncountable islands of the subtropical Korina Archipelago are\u00a0the sanctuary for many who have fled from the never-ending wars of distant Altamere. That land, where the life of the common man is cheap and reckless kings all-too-often burn their lives, and kingdoms, out in blazes of glory.<\/p> <p>The Korina Archipelago is home to several large city-states, each of which views the others as rivals, but generally coexist, for there are greater threats to their safety. Renegade Altameran privateers,\u00a0depraved nation-less pirates, demon-worshiping cannibals, horrors from the uncharted oceans, and far worse are reminders for the city-states of the constant dangers that exist outside their walls.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These dangers are all-too-real, and to whom can one turn to in times of desperation and need when threats arise? Each city-state will defend its own, but outside that, help is not easy to come by. Even the enlightened gods favor all, yet they favor none; those whose prayers and sacrifices are the most persuasive bend their ears for a time. The gods are powerful and wise, but fickle they are, too, and to understand their ways is not the way of man.<\/p> <p>This is no place for the weak of heart. Salvation comes from strength and strength alone. The strong survive, the weak do not.

Here's the description:<\/p> <p><i>In a fit of idealism, Ed Boland left a twenty-year career as a non-profit executive to teach in a tough New York City public high school. But his hopes quickly collided headlong with the appalling reality of his students' lives and a hobbled education system unable to help them: Freddy runs a drug ring for his incarcerated brother; Nee-cole is homeschooled on the subway by her brilliant homeless mother; and Byron's Ivy League dream is dashed because he is undocumented.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>In the end, Boland isn't hoisted on his students' shoulders and no one passes AP anything. This is no urban fairy tale of at-risk kids saved by a Hollywood hero, but a searing indictment of schools that claim to be progressive but still fail their students. Told with compassion, humor, and a keen eye, Boland's story is sure to ignite debate about the future of American education and attempts to reform it.<\/i><\/p> <p>You can get the book here: <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1nzHGxD\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/amzn.to\/1nzHGxD<\/a><\/p> <p>p.s. this restaurant has a fire place, so hopefully we can sit near it this time to sip our sangria!;-)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Womens-NYC-Centric-Book-Club-Meetup\/events\/228524640\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Discuss \"The Battle For Room 314\" and eat Nicaraguan food!","id":"228524640","time":1458079200000,"updated":1458094345000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1406830218000,"name":"Women's NYC-Centric Book Club Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":16104292,"urlname":"Womens-NYC-Centric-Book-Club-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"NYC Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":" 115 W 18th St.","name":"wework ","lon":-73.995644,"id":24242444,"state":"NY","lat":40.740368,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.729847252369,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456764128000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for the Open Entrepreneur Pitching Event for Digital Media, High Tech and Healthcare Start-Ups<\/p> <p>Every Entrepreneur Gets a Table - We Bring the Investors to You!<\/p> <p>Now with more Investors than ever!

Before building my own company, I helped dozens of firms with their software, including some government agencies.

They also have those awesome new reclining seats! And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If you purchase tickets online and can\u2019t make it to the theater, just respond to the email address you receive the confirmation email from (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>) and they can refund the payment remotely.<\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Thur\/Fri) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket unless you buy a gift card at the theater and pre-load it. 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to driver there in advance if you want seats near us.

His research focuses on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Programming_language\">programming languages<\/a>, and he is a prominent author in the field.<\/p> <p>With David Wise, Friedman wrote a highly influential paper on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lazy_evaluation\">lazy programming<\/a>, specifically on lazy streams (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ICALP\">ICALP<\/a>\u00a01976). The paper, entitled \"Cons should not evaluate its arguments,\"\u00a0is one of the first publications pushing for the exploration of a programming style with potentially infinite data structures and a form of programming that employs no computational effects (though programs may diverge). Over the 1970s, Friedman and Wise explored the topic in depth and also considered extensions to the world of parallel computing.<\/p> <p>In the 1980s, Friedman turned to the study of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scheme_(programming_language)\">Scheme<\/a>. He explored the use of macros for defining programming languages; with Kohlbecker,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matthias_Felleisen\">Felleisen<\/a>, and Duba, he co-introduced the notion of 'hygienic macros' in a 1986 LFP paper that is still widely cited today.<\/p> <p>With Haynes and Wand, he simultaneously studied the nature of continuation objects, their uses, and the possibilities of constraining them.\u00a0Following that, Friedman and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matthias_Felleisen\">Felleisen<\/a>\u00a0introduced\u00a0a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lambda_calculus\">lambda\u00a0calculus<\/a>\u00a0with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Continuations\">continuations<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Call-with-current-continuation\">control operators<\/a>.\u00a0Their work has spawned work on semantics, connections between classical logic and computation, and practical extensions of continuations.<\/p> <p>Friedman is also a prolific text book author. His first text book,\u00a0<i>The Little <\/i><i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/LISP\">LISPer<\/a><\/i>, dates back to 1974 and is still in print in its fourth edition, now called\u00a0<i>The Little Schemer\u00a0<\/i>(with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matthias_Felleisen\">Felleisen<\/a>). Friedman and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matthias_Felleisen\">Felleisen<\/a>\u00a0wrote three more \"little\" books in the 1990s:\u00a0<i>The Little\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ML_(programming_language)\">MLer<\/a><\/i>,\u00a0<i>The Seasoned\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scheme_(programming_language)\">Schemer<\/a><\/i>, and\u00a0<i>A Little\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Java_(programming_language)\">Java<\/a>, A Few Patterns<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Friedman is also the lead author of\u00a0<i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Essentials_of_Programming_Languages\">Essentials of Programming Languages<\/a><\/i>, a text book on programming languages. As such, it changed the landscape of language text books in the 1980s, shifting the focus from surveys of languages to the study of principles via series of interpreters. Today's text books on this topic tend to follow this organization, employing operational semantics and type theory instead of interpreters. Like\u00a0<i>The Little LISPer<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Essentials of Programming Languages<\/i>\u00a0is a long-living book and is in its third edition now.<\/p> <p>Friedman also resumed work on his \"Little\" series with\u00a0<i>The Reasoned Schemer<\/i>\u00a0(with Byrd and Kiselyov), explaining logic programming via an extension of Scheme.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most recently Daniel Friedman and Carl Eastlund\u00a0 published The Little Prover which introduces inductive proofs as a way to determine facts about computer programs.<\/p> <p>It is written in an approachable, engaging style of question-and-answer, with the characteristic humor of The Little Schemer (fourth edition, MIT Press). Sometimes the best way to learn something is to sit down and do it; the book takes readers through step-by-step examples showing how to write inductive proofs. The Little Prover assumes only knowledge of recursive programs and lists (as presented in the first three chapters of The Little Schemer) and uses only a few terms beyond what novice programmers already know. The book comes with a simple proof assistant to help readers work through the book and complete solutions to every example.<br\/>.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LispNYC\/events\/228580298\/","yes_rsvp_count":170,"duration":9000000,"name":"An Evening with Dan Friedman","id":"228580298","time":1458082800000,"updated":1458211611000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1291904633000,"name":"LispNYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1748515,"urlname":"LispNYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Lispnycs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"241 west 30th st.","name":"A.R.E.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.
