Acting now is in America\u2019s best interest.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street is the game changer for a fairer, more democratic, humane, balanced, and moral American Tax System<\/p>\n<p>This tiny sales tax on Wall Street is:<br>\n\n .5% on stocks, just $.50 (50 cents) for each $100 of stock trades;<br>\n\n .1% on bonds, just $.10 (ten cents) for each $100 of bond trades;<br>\n\n .005% on derivative speculation in currencies, commodities, or other trades, just $.005 (half a penny) for each $100 of trades<\/p>\n<p>The revenue generated is estimated by economists to be up to 350 billion each year! The Robin Hood Tax can mean slightly less for the 1% at the top and lots more for the 99% below.<\/p>\n<p>Our Current Sales Tax System Does Not Tax the Items That the Top 10% American Households (by Wealth) almost exclusively own.<br>\n\n Things everyone has to buy have a Sales Tax like toilet paper, toothpaste, cars, condo\u2019s and homes. Things only the top 10% of Wealthy Households buy have no sales tax. Sadly that\u2019s True.<\/p>\n<p>Even Worse the top ten percent of American Households have 81% to 94% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and almost 80% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America. Sadly this is another clear example of: Those that have the gold get to make the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations representing over 100,000,000 Americans are now involved with the American Robin Hood Tax Campaign. Thousands of endorsers, 100\u2019s of Organization endorsers, over 1,000 economists, the Vatican, Some of the brightest minds in the country and the 4 of the richest men in America, have endorsed the Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Three Benefits of the Robin Hood Tax<br>\n\n Although every Robin Hood Tax has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.<br>\n\n Curbing volatility of financial markets<br>\n\n In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, \"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.\" Rescuing enterprise from becoming \"the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation\" was also an intended purpose of the Robin Hood Tax and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes.<br>\n\n More fair and equitable tax collection<br>\n\n Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. An Automated Payment Robin Hood tax taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.<br>\n\n According to several leading figures, the \"fairness\" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and\/or replaced, \"prevention of volatility\" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative is one such economist: he sees a Robin Hood Tax as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.[23]<br>\n\n Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives<br>\n\n According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. An Automated Payment Robin Hood Tax employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Stop Blaming the Poor for Wall Streets Greed<\/p>\n<p>Warren Buffett isn\u2019t the only rich guy who wants to higher taxes on the rich, such as The Robin Hood tax which he has specifically endorsed. A survey from Spectrem Group found that 68% of millionaires (those with investments of $1 million or more) support raising taxes on those with $1 million or more in income. Fully 61% of those worth of $5 million or more support increased taxes on million-plus earners.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/highres_409075492.jpeg","photo_id":409075492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/600_409075492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/thumb_409075492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":170802232,"name":"Robin Hood","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/highres_226474072.jpeg","photo_id":226474072,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/member_226474072.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/1\/8\/thumb_226474072.jpeg"}},"members":3,"name":"Manhattan - Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street Campaign Events","id":16974892,"state":"NY","urlname":"Robin-Hood-Tax-on-Wall-Street-Campaign-Events-USA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Robin Hood's Team Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410639851000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"night-photography","name":"Night Photography","id":32968},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"night-photography-workshop","name":"night photography workshop","id":127998}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYNight\/","rating":4.42,"description":"<p>New York has a long, rich history of night photography.

We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, will be judged, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can\u2019t trust the future, we need more ambition and drive, and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world \u2014 full-out. We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be. For more information about Byron Katie and her work, go to thework.com or read her book Loving What Is. There are plenty of youtube.com videos of Katie doing The Work with others and explaining how The Work works. &nbsp;Another good addition to this meetup is my meetup \"Marketing for Artists and Other Creative People\" at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon at our meet up! &nbsp; &nbsp;Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/highres_444638292.jpeg","photo_id":444638292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/600_444638292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_444638292.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14005872,"name":"DezVFX","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/highres_12033901.jpeg","photo_id":12033901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/member_12033901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/4\/6\/d\/thumb_12033901.jpeg"}},"members":1480,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","id":17017142,"state":"NY","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Creative People"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410833210000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"merengue","name":"Merengue","id":20216},{"urlkey":"ballroom-latin-salsa-swing-tango-hustle","name":"Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Swing, Tango, Hustle","id":20839},{"urlkey":"hustle-dancing","name":"Hustle Dancing","id":21002},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"latin-dancing-salsa-merengue","name":"Latin Dancing - Salsa, Merengue","id":33158},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"salsa-classes","name":"Salsa Classes","id":44955},{"urlkey":"salsa-for-singles","name":"Salsa for Singles","id":52314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProAmDanceTeamNYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Do You enjoy dancing Latin, Ballroom, Salsa or all of these dances?

TO THE ORIGINAL BRONX DESIGN MEETUP GROUP<\/p>\n<p>About The Organizer: <br><\/p>\n<p>Hi! My Name is Monica Liu. I started an online Art and Design service named Mon Liu Designs and Art Studio. I run a guest house in The Bronx for traveling artists and professionals who comes from all over the world, currently looking to expand our studios into Queens, hoping to break in to NYC soon. I graduated at The New York School of Interior Design, and an ongoing Student Artist at the Art Student League of New York. I am also a mother of a very open hearted toddler boy. I have covered a variety of mediums: Mix Media Art, Fiber Art, Paper Art and Origami, Painting, Drawing, Set and stage design, Photography and Filmmaking, Economical Friendly Art Installations, Murals, Technical Drafting, Interior Design, Computer-Aid-Design and Architecture.<br><\/p>\n<p>My interest in building a group is: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. To meet Designers and Artists where we can all exchange and learn from each others work. <br><\/p>\n<p>2. To create a meditative space where we can create our work.<\/p>\n<p>3. I make sure part of my meetups are dedicated to parents with small children who never had the chance to get to know the passion inside of themselves and hoping they can find a space here to create artistically. <br><\/p>\n<p>4. I am a lover of traveling so I love to hear and share stories from people that come from other countries and go to visit the country myself to learn about different cultures.<\/p>\n<p>If What you are looking for is 3 or more of the above, You are encouraged to join! We are all about creating a positive lifestyle with arts and retreats. <br><\/p>\n<p> About The Group:<br><\/p>\n<p>We are CREATIVE DESIGNERS who are not just about pick and choose materials for a space but also working creatively on making a space, indoor or out, into creative spaces such as customized ceiling murals, economical-friendly Installations\/ Visual Displays. <br><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever wonder how to get a project started? or have you gotten in the middle of a project and needed someone to give you a nudge to help you thinking outside the box so you can see the project at a new perspective? How about brainstorming with collages, or coming up with a design pattern for a partition wall? How do I achieve that result?&nbsp; I am here to help you spark that creativity within you.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>It sounds fantastic, and we need pure confidence. Knowing that we can make something seems impossible at times when we are so caught up in our lives. SO here I am, working on the creative person in me, I want to create a group to come together with those who are at a creative block at times like myself, we all need some inspiration. We all have build-up on creativity when we dont use it, We're are all talented with something. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are at beginning level, Graduated or an Emerging Professional who did, or learning all aspects of design or getting creative with art projects, me and others are here to encourage you to get that project started and accomplished! To be sure that you get the practice with sufficient hands on experience. <br> <\/p>\n<p>We are based in the Bronx, but we will be holding some meet ups in New York City, go to shows &amp; events, design shops and workshops as we learn to do artistic things like drawing, painting and the process of making something creative. Depending on the experience of our Design Enthusiasts available, we hope to put together some hands-on real projects experiences and tailor meet ups according to our members, so be sure to let us know what you hope to achieve with us. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our group pages at the top panel, as we will consistently update inspirational websites of Art and Design Trends. Also, come back check out our calendar even when there are no meetup scheduled, we could be meeting up with other interior design group events in the city.

So once a month, set aside a night to come eat, drink and listen to some of NYC's most inspirational leaders talk about what they learned from their biggest fuck ups.","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":79328632,"name":"Leonardo M-a","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/3\/a\/highres_230494362.jpeg","photo_id":230494362,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/3\/a\/member_230494362.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/3\/a\/thumb_230494362.jpeg"}},"members":185,"name":"Fuckup Nights NYC","id":17290302,"state":"NY","urlname":"Fuckup-Nights-NYC","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Fuckupers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412012399000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"postgresql","name":"PostgreSQL","id":10361},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"hdfs","name":"HDFS","id":61682},{"urlkey":"gemfire","name":"GemFire","id":1424812},{"urlkey":"hawq","name":"HAWQ","id":1505160},{"urlkey":"spring-xd","name":"Spring XD","id":1505161},{"urlkey":"sql-on-hadoop","name":"SQL on Hadoop","id":1505162},{"urlkey":"greenplum","name":"Greenplum","id":1505163},{"urlkey":"pl-python","name":"PL\/Python","id":1505164}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pivotal-NY\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Welcome to Pivotal New York's Big Data and Analytics Meetup Group.

We want to avoid competitive training and promote co-operative collaboration and mutual support. Our desire is to be quite unique...to be VERY different than the stereotype that music educators often seem to portray. Check out (info@beyondrock.org) (facebook.com\/beyondrockcamp). That 2-4 week summer program is a model of something 'truly' unique. We desire a year round expansion of that program...this is our ultimate goal... classes, lessons, diverse workshops, showcases, etc.\u00a0 Anyone who wants to serve kids\/teens with teaching and coaching rock\/pop\/alternative\/hip-hop\/etc. music (as primary) but ALSO in various other areas... conflict resolution, acceptance of new ideas, theater improv therapy (through theater games), yoga, an array of creative activities and community and confidence reinforcement. Helping kids\/teens \"step outside their comfort zones\" with no fear of judgement. The teaching is one thing and takes exceptional people... still, it's the skilled, strategic, pro-active, organization, directorship and management part that is the really tough part.\u00a0 It takes the combination of educator, humanitarian and entrepreneur to implement such a mission. With all participants from administration to volunteers to equipment setup to instructors...we absolutely prefer the concept of the 'work WITH' mentality...we're not all that fond of the term 'work FOR'. A socialistic, democratic angle to building a company...perhaps...but it seems to work amazingly well with Beyond Rock. A feeling of ownership is essential to develop passion in an individual. That said, obviously there still needs to be an agreement on philosophy and mission and those individuals who thoughtfully plan &amp; guide - leading the course of events. They need to be sharp, very pro-active, extraordinarily communicative (staff, parents, students) and decisive.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/highres_415797942.jpeg","photo_id":415797942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/600_415797942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_415797942.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":116670792,"name":"Maria,Scott & Michael (founders)","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/highres_242605358.jpeg","photo_id":242605358,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/member_242605358.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/0\/e\/thumb_242605358.jpeg"}},"members":101,"name":"Business Entrepreneurs With Music Education in Mind","id":17300272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-Educators-With-Spiritual-Based-Business-in-Mind","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Educators Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412041509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"transgender","name":"TG","id":1237},{"urlkey":"genderqueer","name":"genderqueer","id":4562},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gender-fluid","name":"Gender Fluid","id":25560},{"urlkey":"gender-queer","name":"Gender Queer","id":34510},{"urlkey":"where-to-meet-other-tg-people","name":"Where to Meet other TG People","id":37560},{"urlkey":"shemales","name":"Shemales","id":49111},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"queer-and-questioning","name":"Queer and Questioning","id":53773},{"urlkey":"male-to-female-mtf-transgender","name":"Male to Female, MTF, Transgender","id":62199},{"urlkey":"transsexuals","name":"Transsexuals","id":63635},{"urlkey":"transgender-women","name":"Transgender Women","id":67037},{"urlkey":"transgender-mtf","name":"Transgender MtF","id":138956},{"urlkey":"tgirl","name":"tgirl","id":503042},{"urlkey":"transgender-non-binary","name":"TransGender \u00b7 Non-Binary","id":1497202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonbinary-Safe-Space-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>There are not a lot of safe spaces for nonbinary\/gender variant individuals to meet and socialize, so we've taken the liberty of creating one in NYC.

While we are primarily East Coast, Brooklyn based gamers, our online community contains gamers who we regularly play with across many different States (Utah, Colorado, New Orleans, Massachusetts... etc), across many different platforms and games. We also keep in contact with one another across many different mediums, such as facebook, skype, internet forums, and regular text. As gamers we are all adults, with full-time jobs, some with families, and\/or pursing further schooling. As a result, our atmosphere is drama-free, friendly, and mature. Who has time for drama when you have work in the morning? Ages 21+ is our preferred atmosphere. We enjoy online gaming not just as a hobby, but also a means to foster communities and build friendships. Many of us, are not just fellow gamers who share in a hobby, but are also real life friends. Many of those friendships were formed within different online gaming communities across the decade. We hope our meetup group will continue to build these types of positive relationships created by gaming. As a gaming group, we are an eclectic group with different tastes who all consider online gaming a hobby. Many of us are both casual and hardcore online gamers, with roots also stemming in tabletop and collectible card games (MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh, Versus, Pokemon, D&amp;D... etc).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We are currently engaged in Destiny for the Playstation 4 and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn across multiple platforms and are actively recruiting. While online guilds and clans are a-plenty, our group likes to know who we're playing with. If you're interested in joining our local online gaming community and our other extended online gaming community, we tend to meet-up at different places in Brooklyn and NYC.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In addition, think of our meetup as a way to meet new people who might be playing other online games as well. We hope this is an opportunity to form brand new communities, organic, specifically to meetup. Take the opportunity to meet new people and see what types of games they play. It's a great opportunity to find similar ground in similar games, to build relationships in-game and as well as in real life.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Typically we meet at Xe May Sandwich Shop: 96 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009.

Liberals, don't<br>\n\n do it.<\/p>\n<p>It began in New York City in May, 2003, when it felt as though the<br>\n\n politicians, press and public were giving conservative cons a free pass.<br>\n\n We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session,<br>\n\n playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be<br>\n\n saying.<\/p>\n<p>And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made<br>\n\n buttons.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back<br>\n\n up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards.<br>\n\n But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a<br>\n\n space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and<br>\n\n enlarge a circle of progressive friends.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/highres_419391462.jpeg","photo_id":419391462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/600_419391462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/0\/6\/thumb_419391462.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176938362,"name":"DL","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/highres_233554912.jpeg","photo_id":233554912,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/member_233554912.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/thumb_233554912.jpeg"}},"members":433,"name":"Drinking Liberally NYC","id":17535782,"state":"NY","urlname":"Drinking-Liberally-NYC","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Proud Liberals"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412976329000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mensa","name":"Mensa","id":311},{"urlkey":"gifted","name":"Gifted Adults and Children","id":10476},{"urlkey":"smart-people","name":"Smart People","id":16148},{"urlkey":"intelligent-conversation","name":"Intelligent Conversation","id":45071},{"urlkey":"high-iq","name":"High IQ","id":71674}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup\/","rating":4.58,"description":"<p>A Meetup Group for members of Greater New York Mensa<\/p>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.GNYM.org\">www.GNYM.org<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/highres_439547040.jpeg","photo_id":439547040,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/600_439547040.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/0\/thumb_439547040.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":36158832,"name":"Laura Catania","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/highres_236798392.jpeg","photo_id":236798392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/member_236798392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/f\/8\/thumb_236798392.jpeg"}},"members":84,"name":"Greater New York Mensa Meetup","id":17538592,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greater-New-York-Mensa-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Mensans"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412990206000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dogrescue","name":"Dog Rescue","id":109},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"animalrescue","name":"Animal Rescue","id":10495},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"giant-large-breed-dogs","name":"Giant\/Large Breed Dogs","id":19162},{"urlkey":"dog-friendly-events","name":"Dog Friendly Events","id":22760},{"urlkey":"animals","name":"Animals","id":37663},{"urlkey":"pets-animals","name":"Pets","id":53052},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"large-breed-dogs","name":"Large Breed Dogs","id":687062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DoggyBnBnyc\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>Calling all PET LOVERS in the New York pet community. <br><br>DoggyBnB is a new Dog Sitting Social Network.

We began as one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought Democrats needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176938362,"name":"DL","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/highres_233554912.jpeg","photo_id":233554912,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/member_233554912.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/6\/0\/thumb_233554912.jpeg"}},"members":26,"name":"Drinking Liberally Queens","id":17564492,"state":"NY","urlname":"Queens-Drinking-Liberally","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.75,"who":"DL Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1413105699000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bornagain","name":"Born Again Christian","id":602},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Christian-Leadership-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"The Brooklyn Christian Leadership Group is established to help aspiring Christian Leaders to grow with training and provide resources to excel in awareness to effectively impact, equip, and empower the Body of Christ.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":177180332,"name":"Donna Ghanney","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/d\/5\/highres_245262709.jpeg","photo_id":245262709,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/d\/5\/member_245262709.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/6\/d\/5\/thumb_245262709.jpeg"}},"members":76,"name":"Brooklyn Christian Leadership Meetup","id":17565152,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Christian-Leadership-Meetup","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Christian Leaders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1413131768000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"chihuahua","name":"Chihuahua","id":106},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"toydog","name":"Toy Dogs","id":10003},{"urlkey":"chihuahua-small-dogs","name":"Chihuahua, Small Dogs","id":22986},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"chihuahua-socialization","name":"Chihuahua Socialization","id":79606},{"urlkey":"chihuahua-play-group","name":"Chihuahua Play Group","id":90287},{"urlkey":"small-breed-dog-play-groups","name":"Small Breed Dog Play Groups","id":94029},{"urlkey":"teacup-yorkshire-terriers","name":"Teacup Yorkshire Terriers","id":147962}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Chihuahua-Play-Group-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"All chihuahua owners in Brooklyn.

It started in 2003, during what was a fairly rough time to be politically liberal, as a group that was one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought the political left needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If any of this resonates with you, this group is the right place for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This group is for those of us who do not want to watch our unlived life go by -- the one we know in our hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other without judgment, and create a community that promotes and celebrates risk-taking for your heart's goals (which, unfortunately, our families, friends and society are not always on board with).

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others. (If you do not know the meaning of ANY of these abbreviations, then most likely, you cannot join this group. Sorry...

Brain Body Mastery has two main components. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindfulness\">mindfulness<\/a> and other types of meditation, or low stimulus attention control, meaning focusing in a slow and quiet way. The other component is high stimulus attention control, which is about taking simple movements and brain exercises, and integrating them into complex, whole brain activities. They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain. Practice mindfulness or meditation, and you grow your brain. Even just practice being curious once in a while, and usually your brain grows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The goal of BrBd is to be as <b>in control of our conscious energy<\/b> as possible. The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions. Aside from the longer term benefits, practicing just makes ya feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For more on the subject of skill learning, here is a page from my website on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.com\/insights-from-research.html\">how to master anything<\/a>.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/highres_427608962.jpeg","photo_id":427608962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/600_427608962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/2\/thumb_427608962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128312972,"name":"David Wolovsky","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/highres_238573622.jpeg","photo_id":238573622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/member_238573622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/6\/thumb_238573622.jpeg"}},"members":397,"name":"Brain Body Mastery","id":17933752,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brain-Body-Mastery","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Brain Body Masters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"West New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414583651000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"bni","name":"BNI","id":17157},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-networking-international-bni","name":"Business Networking International (BNI)","id":22878},{"urlkey":"bni-business-based-on-professional-relationships","name":"BNI - Business based on professional relationships","id":47292},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Gold-Coast-Professional-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>If you're looking to grow your business, there is no better way than network referral marketing.

I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/highres_112494562.jpeg","photo_id":112494562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/member_112494562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/thumb_112494562.jpeg"}},"members":27,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414861657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"italian","name":"Italian Language","id":184},{"urlkey":"french","name":"French Language","id":185},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"italian-culture","name":"Italian Culture","id":15028},{"urlkey":"spanish-culture","name":"Spanish Culture","id":19169},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"italian-lessons","name":"Italian Lessons","id":29637},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-italian","name":"Learn to Speak Italian","id":45489},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"learning-spanish","name":"Learning Spanish","id":50595},{"urlkey":"spanish-lessons","name":"Spanish lessons","id":51717},{"urlkey":"french-lessons","name":"French Lessons","id":82861}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Learn-to-Speak-FRENCH-ITALIAN-SPANISH-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in learning FRENCH, ITALIAN, and SPANISH language and culture in NYC!

Our objective is to present public concerts of Songs from India - different regions and languages, in a chorus style, sprinkled with solos. We generally stay away from Bollywood songs. In concerts, we employ live orchestra for accompaniment. Our orchestra is a collection of Indian and Western instruments. While our music is authentically Indian, our performance is a bit fusion in style. Our presentation style is formal and professional, sort of like that of the New York Philharmonic in Lincoln Center.<\/p>\n<p> Our recent concert on October 4, 2015, consisted of 12 non-Bollywood songs from different regions of India. It was a spectacular success and received 10+ minutes spontaneous standing ovation. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are always looking for new singers to join us. If you would like to sing with us or play ANY Indian instrument reasonably well, please contact us. We are located in Hastings on Hudson, NY. <br><\/p>\n<p>We do expect long term commitment for rehearsals and performance. There is a simple audition process before acceptance into the chorus.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to visit our blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/moiwestchester.blogspot.com\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/highres_442866637.jpeg","photo_id":442866637,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/600_442866637.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/e\/d\/thumb_442866637.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4779472,"name":"Avinash Lall","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/highres_240761462.jpeg","photo_id":240761462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/member_240761462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/f\/6\/thumb_240761462.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Westchester Music of India Group","id":18122872,"state":"NY","urlname":"Westchester-Music-of-India-Group","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.9700012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1415318532000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cashflow","name":"Cashflow","id":885},{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"multifamily-investing","name":"Multifamily Investing","id":58294},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-investments","name":"Commercial Real Estate Investments","id":70646},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-financing","name":"Commercial Real Estate Financing","id":71534},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-networking","name":"Commercial Real Estate Networking","id":77426},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-management","name":"Commercial Real Estate Management","id":77427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crowne-Management\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Greetings Everyone,<\/p>\n<p>Crowne Management is a full service property management, with the ability to handle services in commercial, rental and condominium buildings industries.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has the absolute goal to deliver the most efficient solutions and results.

Whole women make SMART decisions and know their value. We refer to ourselves as Diamonds and we are priceless! We bring out the BEST in each other! We plan events that cater to EVERY aspect of your life. We workout together, travel together, save and invest together, pray together, solve problems together. We encourge and RESPECT our sisters at all times This group will strengthen your finances, your relationships, your health and emotional well-being and your spirit. We dont plan events, we create experiences. Designed to help you grow, explore the unique and live OUTSIDE \"the box\". Deep, introspective and amazing!...Not for EVERYONE...only women who want to be wiser, stronger, smarter...who are bold enough to SAY...I WANT MORE. More money, more respect, more love, more self-worth, more adventures, more of ME! My best self. When you bring your best self to every situation, you have the confidence to demand MORE. We limit our group numbers and focus on growth from the INSIDE out. We want active, committed members who ADD to the warm loving supportive atmosphere that we create at our events. We will be leaving meetup soon and expanding. Going National, as we will be featured in a book that we expect to be a National best seller.

We want young females to not feel discouraged to pursue a career in the video game industry and older females to not feel awkward among other games. We want men to be empowered to achieve their dreams and not feel stigmatized by pop culture. Because what We stand for is a Niche Away from the Norm, We strive to create a balanced gaming community of respect, integrity, and harmony among gamers.

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4. Meetings will be held in Manhattan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Sample articles<\/b><br>\n\n List of abbreviations:<br>\n\n NYT - New Your Times<br>\n\n WSJ \u2013 Wall Street Journal<br>\n\n FT \u2013 Financial Times<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 0.\u00a0The Truth About Our Libertarian Age By Mark Lilla -\u00a0newrepublic.com June 17, 2014<br>\n\n 1.

In each dance you will do a set of patterns using skipping steps, which are taught and practiced during the weekly classes.

Sex or touching is not allowed except that sessions may include homoerotic poses; please read the details and FAQ below.

Everyone sets up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Overall session time is 3 hours. It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with a little social time before. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; All artists should be willing to pose on the model stand. First-timers are not required to pose. There are usually more artists than posing slots so not everyone will pose. Sign up for single\/duo\/3-person poses. Erotic\/sensual\/sexualized poses on the model stand welcome (see FAQ below re erotic poses).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Creating interesting poses is the group\u2019s collective responsibility. Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; There is no instruction. Bring all your own materials, drawing boards, portable easels, etc. There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Artists are encouraged to share their work by taping their work to the wall as the session progresses. If you are drawing in a notebook, please share them with whoever is taking the artwork photos at the session. We will photograph drawings to post on social media. We want this to be social (not formal). While we want to improve our artwork, we want to have fun doing it. Don't forget to take your drawings home with you!<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Photography of persons without permission is prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Sexual activity (other than as part of a pose) is prohibited anywhere in the building. While we are a sex-positive group, this is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Bring a towel or sit on your shirt. Please be hygienic.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Bring a backpack or bag to put your stuff in (wallet, phone, etc). MNDGNY or the venues are not responsible for lost or stolen items.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; First-time artists must sign a form allowing (or not allowing) us to publish photos of their artwork done during the session on the group\u2019s sites and social media. Our default is to post artwork only without any identification. It's okay to decline but still fill out a form.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Priority RSVP and \"no-show\" policy<\/b>:<\/p>\n<p> To reward regular attendance and reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d, we are implementing priority RSVPs similar to airline priority seating.

Is there any instruction? There is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. There will be special sessions with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b> I've never been to a naked event before.<\/b> What's it like?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. There are usually about 20 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed (except for footwear depending on venue) after checking in\/paying the fee and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. <i><b>However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, there IS some sexual energy. <\/b>Please read the entire FAQ.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>Do I need to bring my own supplies?<\/b> What is provided? You must bring all your own supplies (paper\/pads, pencils, drawing boards, easels, etc). Most guys draw on pads on their laps. The studio provides chairs, and running water.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>I've never posed before.<\/b> Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We're a friendly and relaxed group, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. We have 2-person poses to accommodate this.&nbsp;<span>First-timers are encouraged to but are not required to pose.&nbsp;<\/span><span>Not everyone poses every session. We have about 10 posing slots per session. There is a sign-up sheet for poses (varying lengths 5-20mins) at the beginning of each session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>What's an erotic pose?<\/b>&nbsp;Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;We're a naked drawing group where erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic\/sexualized poses can simulate sexual acts like masturbating, etc. We're open-minded but don't move&nbsp;too much. It's not a performance piece. If you drip, etc. please wipe off the model stand. Each venue has different guidelines on what's acceptable - this will be announced before each session.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Is this a gay group?<\/b>&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexualized so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>What's the sexual energy of the group like?<\/b>&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies quite a bit depending on who shows up.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I get an erection?<\/b><span>&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Who keeps the drawings that I posed for?<\/b>&nbsp;<span>Each artist keeps his own drawings.

Peer to peer feedback will be a routine aspect of each meeting along with career guidance from industry professionals. Affording opportunities to network both personally and professionally is a foundation of this organization. This is accomplished through the following types of monthly events: - Writing Workshops: We bring in industry professionals for hands-on sessions where you can learn new techniques and skills to improve your work. - Feedback Opportunities and Pitching Practice: You will have many opportunities to present in front of your peers in order to gain exposure and gather feedback. - Networking Events: Meet other writers, actors, directors, producers, and other industry professionals to explore and form new collaborations. - Film Screenings: We curate films based on the group's interest to stimulate and facilitate group discussion and learning. - Guest Speaker Series: We invite active industry professionals who will share their experiences, insights, and advice.

There are so many issues affecting gay or same-gender loving (SGL) men as individuals, and many issues that come up when two (or more) gay\/SGL men come together to form a relationship. These include issues like coming out\/family acceptance; differences in values, priorities and habits; sex, monogamy and sexual or romantic openness; addiction and recovery; financial and life planning issues; health and aging. I have been in a relationship for 25 years and all of these issues have come up. Time and again, my partner and I have felt isolated in wrestling with these issues. I have also had many gay male friends in relationships who have brought these issues up with me in private (and mostly tortured) conversation. Aside from expensive couples counseling, there doesn't seem to be a forum or group for gay male couples partners to share their experiences, seek feedback, ideas and support and offer some in return. (With the group's collective approval, there may be opportunity for a therapist\/facilitator seasoned in the issues and experiences of gay men and couples to help guide the discussion.)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/highres_432311982.jpeg","photo_id":432311982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/600_432311982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/thumb_432311982.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8999930,"name":"Angelo Ragaza","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/4\/a\/c\/highres_248285292.jpeg","photo_id":248285292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/4\/a\/c\/member_248285292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/4\/a\/c\/thumb_248285292.jpeg"}},"members":133,"name":"New York Gay Male Couples Support Meetup","id":18243198,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Gay-Male-Couples-Support-Meetup","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418166868000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"storytelling","name":"Storytelling","id":9429},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"telling-your-story","name":"Telling Your Story","id":18029},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"dating-again","name":"Dating Again","id":20814},{"urlkey":"non-fiction-writing","name":"Non-fiction writing","id":31732},{"urlkey":"short-story-writing","name":"Short Story Writing","id":35414},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shy-singles\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Introverted?

Then we can go out for some food, watch marathon some Netflix, I have a WII U and some games, or do something else.

At least to start anyway. We never start out at a bar, but we often end up at one; however, drinking is not a requirement. As a matter of fact, many of our members do not drink at all, but some do. <\/p> \n<p>Date Walks consist of men and women in a certain age range. We walk and talk while exploring nice outdoor locations such as waterfronts, parks, food festivals, art fairs and the like. Sometimes we do day stuff and sometimes we do night stuff and usually on the weekends. Every 6 or so minutes I ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken with until everyone has spoken with everyone. I usually take the group to a bar\/restaurant for further bonding. Date Walking really is the easiest way to meet someone special.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Some of my more popular and repeating Date Walks are:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>\u25ba Big Group Brooklyn Bridge Sunset Singles Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Central Park Singles Stroll <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles 3-Bridge Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Roosevelt Island Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Stroll around Astoria <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Sunset Walk on the High Line <br>\u25ba Big Group Date Walk for Dog Lovers &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Thank you, <br> Beau, your Date Walking Organizer <br> &nbsp; <br> Call\/Text: 347-225-3516 <br> Email: datewalking@gmail.com<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/datewalking\">Date Walking<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/datewalking\">Facebook<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/datewalking\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>I've tried Plenty of Fish, OKcupid, Coffee meets Bagel, Craigslist, Tinder and so on and it's the same thing every time: a little bit of back-and-forth communication that eventually diminishes to nothing. Either that or you actually meet a person here and a person there and there's no chemistry so it's over. More wasted time. I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't.

I adore great films and even more, sharing my opinions, hearing other's opinions and having lively discussions about movies. I would love to gather together other movie buffs to see movies in a theater and then do brunch, lunch or dinners where we talk about the film and just have fun. Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient. See you at the movies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: I appreciate yearly dues of $5.00 which are given to me at first meetup.<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and do not show up and do not notify us, you will be removed.

While the focus is here in Bay Ridge, we venture off to venues in other parts of Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn Museum and the Heights Players.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production.
