The location will be announced the week before.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s not that hard to understand why Khaled Hosseini\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Kite Runner\u201d (2003), became such a huge best seller, based largely on word of mouth and its popularity among book clubs and reading groups. The novel read like a kind of modern-day variation on Conrad\u2019s \u201cLord Jim,\u201d in which the hero spends his life atoning for an act of cowardice and betrayal committed in his youth. It not only gave readers an intimate look at Afghanistan and the difficulties of life there, but it also showed off its author\u2019s accessible and very old-fashioned storytelling talents: his taste for melodramatic plot lines; sharply drawn, black-and-white characters; and elemental boldfaced emotions.<\/p> <p>Like its predecessor, the new novel features a very villainous villain and an almost saintly best friend who commits an act of enormous self-sacrifice to aid the hero\/heroine. Like its predecessor, it attempts to show the fallout that Afghanistan\u2019s violent history has had on a handful of individuals, ending in death at the hands of the Taliban for one character, and the promise of a new life for another. And like its predecessor, it features some embarrassingly hokey scenes that feel as if they were lifted from a B movie, and some genuinely heart-wrenching scenes that help redeem the overall story.<\/p> <p><br\/>Read more: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/29\/books\/29kaku.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/29\/books\/29kaku.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Brunch-Book-Club-meetup\/events\/227316261\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Our theme for January is Best Books for Discussion","id":"227316261","time":1452441600000,"updated":1452454228000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1321928311000,"name":"Jersey City Brunch Book Club meetup","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":2849372,"urlname":"Jersey-City-Brunch-Book-Club-meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Bookworms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Brooklyn","name":"Brooklyn","lon":-73.966927,"id":23827008,"state":"NY","lat":40.632668,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.21322631836,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452019581000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/f7JbDEFNSQqhVNWCbgUV\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/d3mjyf8rb023qs.cloudfront.net\/api\/file\/f7JbDEFNSQqhVNWCbgUV<\/a><\/p> <p>Found a cool workshop where we can learn to weave and make our own wall hangings!

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

The Order of the Nail (the local Hellknights) have a great disdain for the Voobs; many a time they wait and watch until a single Voob acts outside the law in order to come down on them harshly\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>3) How are the VOOBs perceived by the city populous. Good, Bad, Indifferent?\u00a0<\/p> <p>The general populace tends to view them with awe, sometimes fear, and sometimes suspiciously.<\/p> <p><br\/>4) Is there slavery in the world and how is it considered?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yes, there is slavery on Golarion. \u00a0<\/p> <p>5) Is it condoned either explicitly or otherwise in the city?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Not in Korvosa but there are indentured servants.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6) Outside but nearby the city? Varisia isn't a unified country. \u00a0The city of Kaer Maga has conflicting attitudes to slavery. Slaves can be bought in Downmarket, and are particularly common in the Ankar-Te district, but in the The Bottoms district enslaving another is a capital offence<\/p> <p><br\/>7) Are the VOOBs all honest or can there be dishonest ones? Generally speaking they're honest. On whole I'd view them mostly as chaotic good\/chaotic neutral with some lawful &amp; true neutral members<\/p> <p><br\/>8) I assume that when you said the VOOBs are hired to get rid of \u201cpests\u201d, this was an all encompassing term, meaning not only beasts\/monsters but humanoid and others also. Is this true?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Thus far its only been Animals, Aberrations, Magic Beasts but not Humanoid. \u00a0Typically, the guard will handle humanoid problems.<\/p> <p><br\/>9) Do the VOOBs work for anyone as true mercenaries or do they have alignment ethics? Same answer to as to them being honest<\/p> <p>Note: If you're playing a human please choose one of the many Golarion Human cultures.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pathfinder-RPG-Group-of-Northern-New-Jersey-adults-25yrs\/events\/227835832\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":21600000,"name":"Pathfinder Robert's Campaign","id":"jhdvhlyvcbnb","time":1452448800000,"updated":1452530438000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1433259903000,"name":"Pathfinder RPG Group of Northern New Jersey  (21yrs+)","group_lon":-74.25,"id":18643791,"urlname":"Pathfinder-RPG-Group-of-Northern-New-Jersey-adults-25yrs","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14227032661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1356797713000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>419 Lafayette St. 6th Floor<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>First Degree<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>January 10, 2016 \u00a0<\/i><\/b><b>Introduction to Wicca <\/b><\/p> <p>1st\u00a0 Day of Registration 12:30pm\u00a0<\/p> <p>o \u00a0 What is Wicca?

The combat system keeps combat moving by allowing off-turn interrupts, encouraging players to remain alert and active during all of combat; it also scales seamlessly from two-person hand-to-hand combat up to capital ships battling with entire crews.

On these types of shoots you will be shooting to learn on your own. Feel free to practice, experiment and to learn to direct the model. All our models are hospitable and are willing to help you learn. They are expecting to be told to move to the left when it was meant to the right; Twist your body when meant to be told to turn. But this is what it's all about. To help photographers learn and get comfortable working with models. How the process works: Each photographer will get approximately 30 minutes of actual shooting time.<\/p> <p>The photographer's shooting time is equally divided to shoot each model. Turns will be taken (3 turns per model) by photographers. It's a process that works well and fair. When you arrive, the procedures will be explained before beginning at the same time fees are collected if any are due.

In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of scene work (role playing). You'll be on your feet quite a bit as I'm believer that you learn (and have more fun) through doing rather than hearing an instructor talk. Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.<\/p> <p>This class is $10.

Theatre of the Oppressed is an interactive methodology that is used to investigate situations in which cast members have been denied their basic rights, personally and collectively. In the rehearsal and development stage, the cast shares and combines their real-life stories and struggles into original plays. Topics have covered issues of homelessness and hunger, racism and profiling, unemployment and lack of access to health care, addiction, alcoholism, and an array of family problems. The result is a \u201cforum theatre\u201d performance in which the scenes ask a question of the audience, and the audience (or \u201cspect-actors\u201d) intervene in the action to try out various alternatives to the problems. A donation of $10 will be appreciated to defray costs and support the efforts of the ensemble.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-City-Congregation-for-Humanistic-Judaism\/events\/224229335\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Adult Perspectives - Theatre of the Oppressed","id":"224229335","time":1452457800000,"updated":1452465107000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1250374111000,"name":"The City Congregation for Humanistic Judaism","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1507125,"urlname":"The-City-Congregation-for-Humanistic-Judaism","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Humanistic Jews"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Cranford","address_1":"25 North Ave","name":"Cranford Theatre","lon":-74.302666,"id":23768465,"lat":40.65633,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.6456890106,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452126523000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>at 3:50, we'll see Danish Girl in Cranford Theater, then go to Avenue East on 16 north union ave at around 6:30<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Dinner-and-a-Movie-Meetup\/events\/227900072\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"movie and dinner","id":"227900072","time":1452458700000,"updated":1452471229000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424222063000,"name":"Westfield Dinner and a Movie Meetup","group_lon":-74.3499984741,"id":18442491,"urlname":"Westfield-Dinner-and-a-Movie-Meetup","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"movie and dinner near westfield"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07095","country":"us","city":"Woodbridge","phone":"(732) 602-1220","address_1":"21 Woodbridge Center Drive","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-74.297867,"id":822879,"state":"NJ","lat":40.548244,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.3695106506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451673113000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come play bridge!

You see and hear each other's true struggles, but someone was always there to help out.<\/p> <p>The bond and network you build at WSLab is something you cannot get from a tour \u2013 thinking you are getting the magic, but you often find yourself isolated.\u201d \u2015 Hashimoto Kentaro<\/p> <p>\u201cI've been a CEO for 8 years and thought I knew. I thought I was a risk-taking entrepreneur, but after starting the program, I realized I had stopped challenging myself and taking risks.<\/p> <p>Our thinking was constantly being challenged by design .

This talk will touch on a number of challenges\u00a0which arise in this environment: 1) high volume data streams of around 30 Billion daily\u00a0consumer touch points, 2) low latency requirements on scoring and automated bidding\u00a0decisioning within 100ms and 3) adversarial modeling in the light of advertising fraud and\u00a0bots. \u00a0Specifically, we will discuss an automated learning system implemented at Dstillery,\u00a0that uses privacy friendly data representation to build sparse targeting models for thousands\u00a0of products in Millions of dimensions. The solution incorporates ideas from transfer learning,\u00a0Bayesian priors, stochastic gradient descent, hashing and learning rate estimation. On the\u00a0sidelines, but of no less importance, are topics on bid optimization, data reliability, cross-device identification and observational methods for causal inference. Finally, I will touch on\u00a0a few higher-level lessons around incentive misalignments\/measurement issues in the\u00a0advertising industry and measuring causality on observational data.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio: \u00a0<\/b>Claudia Perlich leads the machine learning efforts that power Dstillery\u2019s digital intelligence for marketers and media companies. \u00a0With more than 50 published scientific articles, she is a widely acclaimed expert on big data and machine learning applications, and an active speaker at data science and marketing conferences around the world.\u00a0Claudia is the past winner of the Advertising Research Foundation\u2019s (ARF) Grand Innovation Award and has been selected for Crain\u2019s New York\u2019s 40 Under 40 list, Wired Magazine\u2019s Smart List, and Fast Company\u2019s 100 Most Creative People.\u00a0Claudia holds multiple patents in machine learning. \u00a0She has won many data mining competitions and awards at Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conferences, and served as the organization\u2019s General Chair in 2014.\u00a0Prior to joining Dstillery in 2010, Claudia worked at IBM\u2019s Watson Research Center, focusing on data analytics and machine learning. \u00a0She holds a PhD in Information Systems from New York University (where she continues to teach at the Stern School of Business), and an MA in Computer Science from the University of Colorado.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/att-nyc-seminars\/events\/227277573\/","yes_rsvp_count":60,"duration":10800000,"name":"Claudia Perlich, Dstillery","id":"227277573","time":1452526200000,"updated":1452538863000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442419133000,"name":"AT&T NYC Research Seminar Series","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18937940,"urlname":"att-nyc-seminars","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.61682844162,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413768231000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Mums - the cold weather is here so please join with other British Mums for our weekly play date.

Repetition. Repetition. <i>Repetition<\/i>. In this class, you will be focusing strictly on the craft of screenwriting, instead of the art. By stepping away and separating yourself from things like story and characters, you'll have the opportunity to really dig in and sharpen your craft, so it's the most effective tool in your arsenal.<\/p> <p><b>A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS CLASS:<\/b><\/p> <p>Before they\u00a0ever step out onto the field, pitchers train.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A pitcher\u00a0will throw curveball after curveball after curve ball until his body memorizes exactly what it needs to do\u2026and so should writers. We must have the muscle memory of the strongest execution of Action, Dialogue and Structure so we can forget it and focus on our story.<\/p> <p><b>In this four\u00a0week class you will get the in-depth attention to your craft and the repetition you need to make sure that every scene you write is as powerful as it can be.<\/b> A combination of lecture, in class exercises and at home assignments will throw you into the fast lane of mastering Formatting, Structure, Action and Dialogue. After mastering the craft you will be able to write faster and more effectively. Don\u2019t be surprised if your first drafts start looking like third drafts and writing becomes more fun and free. Learn to instinctively turn what you see in your head into a scene on the page in a way that anyone could read and not just understand but actually see and feel.<\/p> <p>Whether you are a new writer looking to develop your skills or a professional screenwriter looking to sharpen the well-worn down tools in your tool box, <b>this class is the fast, fun and effective way to make readers, producers and agents see your film\u00a0rather than just read your screenplay<\/b>.<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.writeyourscreenplay.com\/meditative-writing-nyc-online\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>NORMAL COST: $350<\/p> <p>MEETUP MEMBERS: \u00a0Check out the first day of this workshop for <b>only $5 bucks<\/b> with no obligation!<\/p> <p>Class size is strictly limited.

It is based on the belief that we have two thoughts systems, one based on fear and separation from the Divine and another one based on love and oneness with the Divine. The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

This is not an event for the casual observer, but the student and teacher. We are being joined by world famous marijuana researcher Dr. Sue Sisley, who is widely recognized as the most respected researcher in America in the field of cannabis. Dr. Sisley is best known from her appearance in the famed \"Weed 3\" documentary with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN. Her work with PTSD is vitally important to help so many people worldwide. She is a hero to our Veterans and to our industry.<\/p> <p>Dr. Larry Good is the CEO of Compassionate Care Center, a company which finished in the top tier of medical marijuana licenses in NYS. His career in gastroenterology spans close to 40 decades and he worked closely with Tikun Olam, the #1 medical cannabis\u00a0organization in the world. Dr. Good also had partnered up with the Flowering Hope Foundation, best known for its \"Haleigh's Hope\" tinctures which help so many children with epilepsy in Colorado.<\/p> <p>NYC Councilman Rafael Espinal will be on hand to discuss cannabis legalization in NYC and how we can work to legalize it! He will deliver a keynote speech to kick off our event!<\/p> <p>Please join us for a night of in depth learning and networking at our new event space in the beautiful 1250 Broadway building in Midtown Manhattan. Chances are, you have never been to a cannabis event in a more exclusive location. Lets get excited! New York's medical\u00a0cannabis program\u00a0will launch in January and those who attend this presentation will learn more in the two hours we spend together than you can gather in months online!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>As per usual wine, food, and snacks will be served! In addition a special \"THANK YOU\" gift bag will be given to all who purchase tickets with giveaways from our sponsors InnovativeCBD and more! We are breaking into 2016 with a bang! Join us for this luxurious experience on 1250 Broadway! We also will have several corporate sponsors joining us. We will be announcing in the coming days!

However, assuming a constant recovery has two major effects. The first is we have inconsistent pricing (if recovery is a known constant, what is the price of a recovery swap) and the second is over- or underpricing the default risk portion of the credit spread . In this talk I will present recent work on isolating the recovery risk premium in corporate bond and CDS spreads using both structural and hazard rate models.\u00a0 This allows us to isolate the recovery risk premium from the default risk premium, as well as provide a consistent pricing framework for all recovery linked products including bonds, CDS and recovery swaps.\u00a0 Finally, we discuss some trading opportunities that can be exploited using framework.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Costanzino<\/b> received his PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2006 from Brown University in Providence R.I.

If you don't get an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request. I always learn something new at the group, like an advanced feature, or a glitch\/bug to beware of. For example, did you know that formulas entered in the Named Range box calculate as \"Array Entered\". It's OK, to arrive half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient. This event is scheduled for 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM.

Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again.

Welcome to 2016.\u00a0\u00a0With so many new and new-ish players I've pulled \u00a0a few important sections of our FAQ page. We don't have many rules. What we do have is to help all of us have a great evening and to keep things moving \u00a0along. And to accommodate as many players as possible. Please take a minute to read what follows and take them to heart.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Q. What are the rules of this open mic?<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0We play up to two songs or 8 minutes, whichever comes first.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Be respectful of others and they'll return the favor.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Don't apologize on stage (or you will owe me a drink).\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Please no loopers,\u00a0iPad\u00a0backing tracks, fx boxes, extra amps, and stuff like that.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Please put $5 in the kitty to support the the Open Mic. \u00a0We have to pay fees\/dues to the parent MeetUp organization. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Q. How does signup work?<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>The sheet gets put out at about 6:00PM. You sign up for a slot and playing starts by 7. We try very hard to get to everyone on the list so a lot of the rules we have are in the interests of that.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>PLEASE NOTE:<\/i>\u00a0Because of the relatively small size of Mary O's, we can accommodate about 20 or so players. Please come come as early as you can to get on the list. Out of necessity the list gets closed when we max out our playing slots.\u00a0<b>\u00a0After the list is closed, we may be able to have a few extra players for one song each.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Q. Is there a drink\/food minimum?\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Yes.<\/i>\u00a0Mary O'Halloran requests that in return for hosting us, we return the favor by buying a minimum of two beers or two drinks, or a drink and something to eat. One cup of tea for the entire evening does not help Mary pay her rent.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The bar has plenty of great stuff to drink -- both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The kitchen turns out great food. Burgers, chicken, fish, and there are plenty of vegetarian and salad options as well. PLEASE partake.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Mary does need to make a living and we want her to love us so she keeps having us back.

It is a more efficient way to provide food and water to your plants. Plants don\u2019t use soil \u2013 they use the food and water that are in the soil. Soil\u2019s function is to supply plants nutrients and to anchor the plants\u2019 roots.

A project put together by a few members of the Maker Depot makerspace in Totowa, NJ.. This motorcycle was one of the projects that we highlighted at NYC maker faire in September.<\/p> <p>For 2016, we want to go even bigger. In terms of complexity and size of team. If you are a willing participant in the process, and are able to spend the necessary time over the next 8+ months to contribute your skills, we have a project for you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What are we going to make? Well, that is the purpose of this kickoff meeting. We want you to come to the meeting with ideas on what to make. We already have 3 or 4 ideas on the builds we would like to do, but we are going to be more democratic in our approach to determining what to build. Come with pictures, videos, drawings, figures, etc. of something that we can build together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>How Big? \u00a0While we would love to make a life sized AT-AT, that is actually a little too big of a job for us to take on, as well as storing the creation for the long term. We are looking at something that is probably about 10 feet tall and a 5 or 6+ feet wide\/deep. We would like the project to be somewhat familiar to the general population, so try to limit your ideas to that.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This project will kick-off in January and go until mid-September with the Maker Faire in Queens, NY to be its official unveiling. We would also like to have this showcased at the 2016 NYC Comic-Con, which is in October.<\/p> <p>Here are the ground rules for working with us:<\/p> <p>1 - You have to be committed to making 25 - 50% of the build days per month.. Probably have 8-10 official build days\/times that you can choose from. There could also be \"unofficial\" build days as we move into our build.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2 - You will be asked to donate materials or money to the cause. The budget is still undetermined, but we are thinking that $4000 is the max we would be spending for this entire project. If you have materials that you can find, scrounge or even supply that would be GREAT. If you don't have any materials, then providing some money each month to help fund the project will then be required. Again, the amount is unknown at this time, but we are thinking $50\/month maximum.<\/p> <p>3 - You have to be motivated and eager to learn and build something great with a team.<\/p> <p>Here is what you will get out of this:<\/p> <p>1. The pride of accomplishment of building a unique thing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. You will learn. You will learn a lot. Some of the technologies that I foresee using for this project include:<\/p> <p>3D printing and 3D designCAD (Computer Aided Design)CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)CNCing (Computer Numerical Control) for both wood and metalsMold making and castingWood workingWeldingPainting and finishingElectronicsProgramming<\/p> <p>\u00a0FAQs (Frequently asked questions)<\/p> <p>* Do I have to be a member of Maker Depot to participate?\u00a0<\/p> <p>No. You can participate with the project whether you are a member or not. To use any of the bigger tools, you will have to be a member and have been signed out on the machine.<\/p> <p>* If I am a member, do I get to do this for free?<\/p> <p>Again, we are \"crowd\" funding this project, and we ask for either supplies or money to help fund it. We will work with you on determining what you can offer and the value to the project.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* What if I can only work a few hours a month?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are looking for people that are dedicated to the project, but there is always room for people to participate at a lower level. There may be times during the months that you can work only a few hours, but those hours will add up.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* How many people are you looking to help?<\/p> <p>We are going to CAP this off at 30 maximum builders.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* How old do you have to be to participate?<\/p> <p>12 and older. You will have to be 18 and older to use any of the tools.<\/p> <p>* What skills do I need to bring to the party?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We expect to have people that have mad skills in making as well as those that have never done this. If you don't know what to do, we are here to work with everyone to show you and mentor you on how to make this project come to life<\/p> <p>* Who will own the project when it is completed?<\/p> <p>The Maker Depot will own this project at completion.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maker-Depot-makerspace\/events\/227780607\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Maker Depot \"BIG BUILD\" kickoff meeting","id":"227780607","time":1452641400000,"updated":1452704354000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420756782000,"name":"Maker Depot makerspace","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":18314443,"urlname":"Maker-Depot-makerspace","group_lat":40.9000015259,"who":"Makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"150 Broadway, 20th Floor","name":"LMHQ","lon":-74.010071,"id":23879840,"state":"NY","lat":40.709183,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":135,"headcount":0,"distance":3.01582670212,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":17,"created":1450379751000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.80000019073},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/7\/e\/600_445201918.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>AgTech innovation is on fire.

In fact Leonard Bernstein does this whole thing where he talks about the deep structure of poetry.\u00a0 So I think my Dad was very interested in people individually contributing to the film their own deep structure and I think that is the most important thing I can say about what my father felt about his films and what he felt was important and I extrapolate this from the fact that he loved that lecture so much.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be somewhere in the great new food court with a Stanley Kubrick Meetup sign on the table.

Ari\u2019s case was severe, and required over a dozen daily medications and several hospital visits. After reaching a personal low point in hospital, Ari decided he would do everything in his power to strengthen his, by then, weak body.\u00a0Through a combination of yoga, nutrition, natural supplements and rigorous exercise (Triathon and\u00a0Crossfit) he was able to fight back the symptoms of Crohns until he was finally able to suspend his medication. Eventually Ari was declared free of all traces of the \u2018incurable\u2019 disease, and competed in Ironman France in June of 2011.<br\/>Ari has since spoken at seminars and at a regional\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tedxtalks.ted.com\/video\/TEDxEast-Ari-Meisel-Beats-Crohn\">TED Talk<\/a>\u00a0about his struggle against a seemingly insurmountable\u00a0opponent.<\/p> <p>Through the process of data collection, self tracking, and analysis, Ari helped develop\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/lessdoing.com\/\">Less Doing<\/a>.

Happy holidays to all of my fellow Taquitos. After a little me time it\u2019s time to get back to Tuesday action. To make up for lost time I am hitting you with a Tuesday double header. Taco Tuesday's returns HARD with Los Tacos No 1. and Takumi Taco. I have been dying to hit both of these and am looking forward to doing it with you! First we have Los Tacos No 1. Straight out of Tijuana these guys &amp; gals focus delivering you the flavors of the motherland. There is even a coveted secret menu taco which I will tell you about when you get there. The promise is to deliver on sabor and authenticity in an environment known for luxurious vittles.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/2\/600_445500466.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>2nd up is a not so traditional setup. Takumi focuses on bringing you traditional Japanese flavors but in the vessel of Tacos and Burritos. Two things we can't ever seem to get enough of. (I know Gaby, Sacrilege) But with tacos like Sapporo Braised Shortrib w Napa cabbage, Japanese mustard, scallion, yuzu avocado crema, black sesame seeds, corn tortilla and Japanese Curry Beef, cotija cheese, napa cabbage slaw, in a gyoza shell I just can\u2019t front on that! I am looking to put these guys to the test but only after Los Tacos No 1. Or vice versa. (Order of operations TBD)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/b\/600_445500475.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join me on this MPD Trek that officially kicks off The Taco Tuesday for 2016 with a KABLAOWEY TACO BANG!!! We will assemble in the interior front of Chelsea Market to vote on the order of operations and go to town from there. This should be an amazing night filled with flavor on top of flavor and many other delights in between.<\/p> <p>For those down for the notorious D e R M after party action. There will be Tikis involved. See you there!<\/p> <p><b>P.S. Please be considerate and change your RSVP or let us know if you are running late.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

For our first event of the year, Mike Benjamin will be leading a discussion around medical diagnosis and the principles of Occam's Razor.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We have several new announcements to make at this event for our 2016 calendar and event format, so don't miss out!\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Without further ado, here's Mike!<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Event Description<\/b><\/p> <p>As medical diagnostic tools advance technologically, more and more data is available to physicians to theoretically make more accurate and timely diagnoses. The problem is the increased complexity that comes with greater access to this data.<\/p> <p>Historically diagnostic medicine\u2019s most important tool has been the \u201cHistory of Present Illness (HPI)\", the interview with the patient of symptoms. (See below for description.) This interview is still important to decide what tests to do, but even with these tests, there is still the problem of integrating and analyzing all of the information in a logical process and come up with an accurate diagnosis.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is getting even more complex as we have more tools which provide more data on each patient, making it more difficult for physicians to benefit form the advancing technology. I would even say, based on my own experience, that the diagnostic process becomes more difficult and physicians, overwhelmed with data fallback to oversimplification of the diagnosis and miss important correlations. (Occam\u2019s Razor vs. Hickam\u2019s Dictum)<\/p> <p>How do we address these increasing complexities. What technological solutions can we come up with to integrate and order this information to allow physicians to make more accurate and timely diagnoses? (i.e. AI, Data Informatics, etc.)<\/p> <p><b>A Brief <i>History of Present Illness<\/i> (HPI):<\/b><\/p> <p>It is also common wisdom in medical education that the most powerful diagnostic information is the patient interview, specifically the History of Present Illness (HPI).\u00a0<\/p> <p>The HPI is the portion of the patient\u2019s story of illness in which the patient tells the symptoms, time frame, relationship of the various symptoms, and his or her interpretation of them. The physician\u2019s task in this portion of the interview is to understand the patient\u2019s story in the context of the nonverbal clues for such things as anxiety, anger, or depression that are also present.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The physician must facilitate a story from a patient experiencing one of these uncomfortable emotions. This cumulative task requires enormous skill, which is not encouraged in much of the curricula of medical school.

Their desperate plan to revive an ancient legendary elder only lead to another powerful blood-slave for Prada.<\/p> <p>- The Carthian Movement was swept up in the furor of a demagogue Strix hell bent on a literal \"Eat the Rich!\" campaign, with only Oddvar emerging unscathed from the resulting diabelerie blood hunt. With their last elder Walt seemingly despondent and poised to leave the scene, the future of the Momvent is uncertain.<\/p> <p>- The Lancea Sanctum rules the city, but the Prince must deal with the realities of the political landscape, which means dealing with the players.<\/p> <p><br\/>Additionally, in the process of carrying out their personal vendettas the coterie has seized control of the large scale criminal enterprises of the city, enslaved judiciary figures and made deals with various other supernatural individuals and organizations.<\/p> <p><br\/>But each of the Demented raved of an apocalypse to come, other precognitive societies have distanced themselves from the Kindred and retreated underground, and the Cacophony is stirring with stories.. unbelievable stories.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, let's see if 2015 New York can do better than 1547 Moscow, 1303 Alexandria or 64 Rome and survive the Birds of Dis.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Noumena\/events\/227897462\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Vampire the Requiem 2E: Dark and Full of Terrors","id":"227897462","time":1452643200000,"updated":1452655328000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1336136080000,"name":"Noumena: A World of Darkness RPG Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3797562,"urlname":"Noumena","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Roleplayers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","phone":"917-842-3573","address_1":"Grand Army Plaza","name":"Prospect Park","lon":-73.970509,"id":693957,"state":"NY","lat":40.673468,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.39644241333,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1390919228000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be doing a Prospect Park training run meeting at the Grand Army Plaza Entrance to the Park (right outside the Park) at 7:00 PM.

Ever wanted to break into responsive, mobile development with only a background understanding of HTML\/CSS and some scripting languages? Feel like you understand some of the fundamentals of web-programming but know next-to-nothing about mobile apps? Want to brush up on some Javascript from a previous course? If so, this course is for you!<\/p> <p>We'll spend some time getting everyone up to speed on some basics of Javascript, and then explore the core features of Meteor as we\u00a0build a functional chat application with very little code (&lt;100 lines of Javascript! Wowwee!).\u00a0<\/p> <p>This two-part workshop will cover:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Meteor installation and creating your own app<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Implementing a basic chat app<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Adding user accounts<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Refining the app UI<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Deploying the app and creating a mobile version<\/p> <p>Want to try it yourself, or test it out before the class?

A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be running some commands for installation, changing directories, and interacting with Meteor's CLI throughout the class. Do not be intimidated, the course will walk you through all steps and you will be provided with sample code to build our course app!<\/p> <p>You should bring your own computer to class and have administrative privileges for installing software, and please bring your power supply! :)<\/p> <p><b>About the Instructor:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meteor-NY\/members\/13397212\/\">Christie<\/a>\u00a0is a technology entrepreneur working on communications and bioinformatics applications.\u00a0 Christie co-organizes events for Kids Technology Lab, PyLadies and Meteor NY.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/600_445500053.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/22281251\/\">Aurelia<\/a> is a developer working on community and code at the Mozilla Science Lab, you might have seen her newsletter emails for GDI.

Please let the coach on deck know if it's your first time with us and feel free to message Alex Barclay ahead of time if you have any questions. You will need to bring a swim suit appropriate for water polo, a towel, goggles and a lock. If you would like to practice with us regularly, you must become registered with US Water Polo at the silver level and pay our annual membership dues.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We ask that any practice participants have some prior experience playing water polo and be able to swim a hundred yards in a row in less than two minutes. If you have a swimming background and are interested in learning water polo, please read the pdf below thoroughly and contact Alex Barclay. The coaching is typically geared to an intermediate level of play and we do work on basic skills at every practice. Everyone should be familiar with the basic rules and concepts of the game, as outlined in this pdf:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nPractices typically include a swim set and some conditioning at the beginning, drills, and scrimmaging for the last 30-45 minutes (it's also ok to sit out for the scrimmaging portion if it's your first practice). Bob or Jeff are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Ask to be directed to the pool.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Water-Polo-Meetup\/events\/227807579\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"TNYA Intermediate Water Polo","id":"nfwcmlyvcbqb","time":1452646800000,"updated":1452655484000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1418707697000,"name":"New York Water Polo Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18256141,"urlname":"New-York-Water-Polo-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Water Polo Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York City","address_1":"221 West 38th Street ","name":"Tagine","lon":-73.989494,"id":18895822,"state":"NY","lat":40.754055,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.281905472279,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448933066000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The mesmorizing and beautiful\u00a0Arabella\u00a0will be bellydancing Tuesday night at 8pm.<\/p> <p>Enjoy delicious Moroccan dinner and an amazing show!<\/p> <p>Comes with\u00a01 appetizer, one dinner entree and a glass of wine or Moroccan Sangria.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.taginedining.com\/\">P<\/a>urchase tickets here:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-wonderful-and-spectacular-bellydance-show-by-arabella-tickets-20715554782\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-wonderful-and-spectacular-bellydance-show-by-arabella-tickets-20715554782\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-wonderful-and-spectacular-bellydance-show-by-arabella-tickets-20715554782<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.taginedining.com\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/5\/2\/600_445724370.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Happy-Hour-Meetup\/events\/227902991\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Dinner and Bellydancing Show!","id":"zqlpmlyvcbqb","time":1452646800000,"updated":1452658978000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427750247000,"name":"New York Happy Hour Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18526728,"urlname":"New-York-City-Happy-Hour-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"happy hour lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":21.9513301849,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1373383518000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>O'Connors has a great Trivia game going every Tuesday.

On Tuesday, President Obama addressed the nation in his final State of the Union address, where he\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage1.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=69046896d8&amp;e=93755f9018\">sang the praises of TPP<\/a>and urged Congress to pass it. In early February, President Obama will travel to New Zealand to participate in a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage1.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=a0304d9dac&amp;e=93755f9018\">TPP signing ceremony<\/a>with the 12 member nations of the agreement. But until Congress actually votes to implement TPP, President Obama's signature on the agreement is an empty gesture. Thus, after the signing, the President wants Congress to vote on TPP as soon as possible, recognizing that the closer we get to November, the more reluctant members of Congress seeking reelection will be to vote for unpopular trade policies<\/p> <p><br\/>Last week, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=10401f9877&amp;e=93755f9018\">Business Roundtable<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=1a9745cfbe&amp;e=93755f9018\">US Chamber of Commerce<\/a>\u00a0formally came out in support of TPP last week, after previously holding their endorsements until they could lock in more pro-corporate rules in the form of TPP side agreements.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=f0ca06648b&amp;e=93755f9018\">Unlike Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell<\/a>, they don't want to wait until after the election for a vote and want to rush TPP through Congress before even more of the public learns just how rotten a deal TPP really is.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt's clear that pro-TPP corporations have reason to worry. Also last week, energy company TransCanada launched a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=6015567d31&amp;e=93755f9018\">$15 billion NAFTA investor suit<\/a>\u00a0against the United States as a result of the Obama administration blocking the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, further illustrating the potential disaster of nearly doubling the number of corporations empowered to attack our environmental laws via TPP investor suits. Environmentalists nationwide will now recognize that climate justice requires trade justice, allowing us to grow the ranks of activists fighting to defeat TPP.<\/p> <p><br\/>As if that weren't enough bad news for TPP's backers, last Thursday, Citizens Trade Campaign released a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=dfa3386146a1d70682e4f52aa&amp;id=73020a4472&amp;e=93755f9018\">letter to Congress<\/a>\u00a0signed by over 1500 organizations vs. TPP. TradeJustice and several of our member groups were proud to add our named along with so many other groups fighting to put the public interest ahead of corporate greed.<\/p> <p><br\/>All of this makes this week a vital time for action. During the State of the Union, the pro-TPP group Organizing for Action (formerly Obama for America) held viewing parties to sell grassroots progressives on TPP. TradeJustice activists attended some of them to share the real facts about TPP. For the remainder of the week, we can expect to see the Obama administration and pro-TPP corporations continue to push their TPP talking points in the media. It's absolutely vital that we take action to counter the TPP backers' lies in the media and contact our elected officials to let them know that voters reject TPP \u2013 and demand that they do the same!. Below, you'll find critical actions you can take right from your computer plus a packed week of leafleting opportunities, lectures to attend live or via livestream, informational conference calls, a datentry party, and a major public TPP hearing in Washington, DC. The week ends with a national webinar looking at how the World Trade Organization continues to threaten our consumer and environmental protection laws and how this illustrates why we must stop TPP from expanding these attack on the public interest.
