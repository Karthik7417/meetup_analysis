This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees.

In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

As corporate America becomes more inclusive and further diversifies its supply chain, certification offers the opportunity for LGBT-owned businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors.<\/p>","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":68500742,"name":"Joe Renga","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/highres_248123136.jpeg","photo_id":248123136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/member_248123136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/thumb_248123136.jpeg"}},"members":347,"name":"New Jersey LGBT Chamber of Commerce","id":18757966,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-LGBT-Chamber-of-Commerce","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437503918000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LES-Writers-Salon\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Fiction writers, playwrights, and poets who want to get critiqued , get published, and make friends.<\/p> \n<p>No memoir writers please<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138438392,"name":"Ana Wieder Blank","photo":{"photo_id":185431662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/member_185431662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/thumb_185431662.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"LES  Writers Salon","id":18758170,"state":"NY","urlname":"LES-Writers-Salon","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437508595000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"exchangestud","name":"International and Exchange Students","id":3451},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/interEDGE\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.interEDGE.org\">interEDGE.org<\/a> provides monthly group coaching to international students in Greater New York City.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>The group will be limited to a small group at a time to ensure the quality of the conversation and guaranteed support to each member.<\/p>\n<p>*&nbsp;Who should join:&nbsp;All international students.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered.

It can be a bit more difficult meeting new like minded people to; try new things, exchange ideas and enjoy activities as single adults. \"Living Single\" was one of my favorite tv shows of the 90's! (If you missed out, check it out on youtube) The show was about a group of girlfriends making it through single life. I created this New Jersey group for women ( mid 20's to mid 30's) to cultivate a similar experience. So, if you're looking to meet new girlfriends, try out-of-the-box events and enjoy positive experiences around the tri-state, get from behind the T.V., iPad, iPhone and and come check us out!<\/i><\/p>","lon":-74.2699966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/highres_440309080.jpeg","photo_id":440309080,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/600_440309080.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/thumb_440309080.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10686067,"name":"Danielle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/highres_248325773.jpeg","photo_id":248325773,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/member_248325773.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/thumb_248325773.jpeg"}},"members":37,"name":"Living Single","id":18781269,"state":"NJ","urlname":"meetup-group-sPxvyFeJ","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Folks"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438137278000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"kayaking","name":"Kayaking","id":590},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"skiing","name":"Skiing","id":2294},{"urlkey":"snowboard","name":"Snowboarding","id":3425},{"urlkey":"ccskiing","name":"Cross-Country Skiing","id":3490},{"urlkey":"snowshoeing","name":"Snowshoeing","id":6696},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"snowsports","name":"Snowsports","id":28845},{"urlkey":"winter-sports","name":"Winter Sports","id":34378},{"urlkey":"downhill-skiing","name":"Downhill Skiing","id":37246},{"urlkey":"cross-country-skiing","name":"Cross Country Skiing","id":52821},{"urlkey":"snow-activities","name":"SNOW ACTIVITIES","id":133504}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pinnacle-Ski-Sports-Club\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>Skiers, snowboarders, showshoers, hikers, bikers, adventurers, winter sports enthusiasts.<\/p>","lon":-73.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/highres_441360711.jpeg","photo_id":441360711,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/600_441360711.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/thumb_441360711.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190577679,"name":"Pinnacle Ski & Sports Club"},"members":216,"name":"Pinnacle Ski & Sports Club","id":18781361,"state":"CT","urlname":"Pinnacle-Ski-Sports-Club","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Caldwell","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438181511000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"camping","name":"Camping","id":374},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"fishing","name":"Fishing","id":1255},{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"mountain-biking","name":"Mountain Biking","id":20266},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"northern-new-jersey","name":"Northern New Jersey","id":35537},{"urlkey":"local-activities","name":"Local Activities","id":64867},{"urlkey":"nature","name":"Nature","id":197471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/westessex\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>As a child, I spent much of my life outdoors. &nbsp;Whether in a backyard or campground, many of my fondest memories have something to do with being outside. &nbsp;Now with a family of my own, I cant help but notice how much time our digital devices consume us on a daily basis. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I'm a self proclaimed tech junkie. &nbsp;Like many of you, my cell phone is attached to my hip, whether for professional or personal reasons.<\/p>\n<p>I created this Meetup to encourage people to reconnect with the great outdoors.

Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English?&nbsp; <br>3. Ready to work&nbsp;<i>REALLY&nbsp;<\/i>hard and do the REAL work that it will take to truly become fluent?&nbsp; <br>4. Are you also ready to have fun and make friends who are as serious about language learning as you are?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If so, my name is Monroe Mann, and WELCOME TO THE FLUENCY PROJECT.&nbsp; <br> <br>MY DEFINITION OF NATIVE-LEVEL FLUENCY:&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of what is said on TV, in movies, and on the radio&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of modern slang&nbsp; <br>--can effectively and clearly communicate orally and in writing, with 99% grammatical and linguistic accuracy, not including technical conversations&nbsp; <br>--can read modern fiction, history books, newspapers, and magazines with a 99% word and sentence comprehension rate, without use of a dictionary<\/p>\n<p>I'm a linguist myself, and speak Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, and others (at various levels of proficiency). While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example:&nbsp; <br>* read books;&nbsp; <br>* write essays;&nbsp; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises&nbsp; <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy&nbsp; <br>* give presentations;&nbsp; <br>* watch movies;&nbsp; <br>* listen to the radio;&nbsp; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on.&nbsp; <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:)&nbsp; <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived.&nbsp; <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic&nbsp; <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup!&nbsp; <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

I want people to truly get to know each other...to have good conversation...I don't want this to feel like a networking\/pickup-y\/name-tag kind of group.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><strong>Our<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>group (whose&nbsp; events will be purposefully small&nbsp;in size) is not&nbsp;like other Meetup groups <\/strong>where you can&nbsp;feel anonymous.&nbsp; <strong>Not showing up<\/strong> for events of this size <strong><em>does<\/em> affect the host and other attendees<\/strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that things happen.&nbsp; All I ask is that <strong>if you can no longer attend, <\/strong>or have a strong sense you will be <strong>held up at work or with family issues<\/strong>, that you <strong>give me Two Hours notice.&nbsp; Anyone who simply does not show up or give me&nbsp;sufficient notice<\/strong> that they can no longer&nbsp;make&nbsp;the event (<em>or else who doesn't provide a damn good explanation and profuse apology after the fact ....lol<\/em>), <strong>will have to be removed from the group<\/strong>..&nbsp; I don't do this to be a taskmaster or anything...it's just&nbsp;<strong>very disheartening for me&nbsp;to pay Meetup Organizer dues,&nbsp; arrange events<\/strong>, provide very detailed information on events to the group, and <strong>then for me to&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;the venue, only to find a bunch of no-shows<\/strong>.&nbsp; All I ask is for <strong>common courtesy.&nbsp; If you're not prepared to give me&nbsp;that, that you shouldn't join <\/strong>this group.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Thank you for your understanding!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every so often I will arrange for a somewhat larger outing<\/strong>, once I feel that enough good relationships have been created between members of the group. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>'YES' to:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>- members that are <b>engaging<\/b>, who have a <b>positive energy<\/b>, with <b>varied interests<\/b>, and who are <strong>comfortable meeting new people and diving right into conversation!&nbsp;&nbsp; All profiles must include a clear photo <\/strong>of YOU (no sunglasses, no hat, no fuzzy\/long-distance photos, no photos of pets or avatars) <strong>and&nbsp;your real name<\/strong> (i.e., not the name of a Superhero, etc.)&nbsp; I don't like hosting small,&nbsp;intimate events and having no clue who I am to meet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>- <\/strong>members who understand <strong>our events will generally be small and intimate, <\/strong>and that&nbsp;<strong>communicating to the host if you can no longer attend, is expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p> - events where we <b>support and enjoy both<\/b> the n<b>ew AND the old-school establishments of Astoria<\/b>. <i>(I think it's hugely important to support the small businesses that have been in Astoria for more than a few years, and which seem to be gradually disappearing due to rent increases, etc,)<\/i> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>'NO to:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> - joining this group with the <b>sole purpose<\/b> of hoping to <b>fill that romantic void i<\/b>n your life.&nbsp; (I<i> prefer members who already consider their lives full and engaging versus people who come to events, scope out the attendees, decide there's no one that 'interests' them, and then they disengage from the group.)&nbsp; <\/i>There are plenty of other 'singles' Meetup groups if that's your area of focus. <br><\/p>\n<p>- joining this group because you <b>see all Meetup members as potential clients<\/b> for your business, product, etc.<\/p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br><\/p>\n<p>I find groups most interesting when they have&nbsp;a <b>good mix of members&nbsp;(singles\/couples, straight\/gay, younger\/older, etc.,<\/b>) so no one should think this group might not be for them!&nbsp; I'd like to have members who've already figured out that you can be good friends with people who have <b>different backgrounds from you, different political views, economic backgrounds, much older\/younger than you<\/b>, etc.&nbsp; What matters most is that we all are <b>people with positive energy, and respect each others' viewpoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; To help offset the fees<\/strong> that I must pay to Meetup.com each month as a Group Organizer, I'd like to <strong>kindly ask for a $2 donation from each member, whenever they attend one of our events<\/strong>.&nbsp; Thank you!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for your interest, and hope to see you soon!

A disproportionate number of young people are labeled and treated for A.D.D. in the U.S. compared to most other countries.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":31,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks.

We don't have the luxury of wide open fields with no one around to bother. I am a member of a local aviation club, but it can take up an hour or longer each way to get there and it just isn't always practical. I like to fly small to larger airplanes as well. I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that.

To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals!

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws. Forge new friendships and get support based on healthy living. &nbsp;The program is free to users except for the shared cost of the meal, about $15\/meeting.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/highres_444762109.jpeg","photo_id":444762109,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/600_444762109.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/7\/d\/thumb_444762109.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8033889,"name":"Michael Rickicki","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/highres_7711566.jpeg","photo_id":7711566,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/member_7711566.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/e\/thumb_7711566.jpeg"}},"members":167,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","id":18957225,"state":"NY","urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"East Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442936166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"nature-walks","name":"Nature Walks","id":19666},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/All-Women-Adventure-Travel-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for people who want to bond through international travel.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting? Each meeting will consist of a forum providing compliance advice for a specific aspect of the technology sector (e.g. WCAG guidelines for website\/app design, payment systems compliance issues, cryptocurrency issues, etc...), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A for items to be discussed either at that meeting or answered in the following meeting. The meetings will start in November and will be held on a monthly basis. We look forward to seeing you there!

The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.<br>EO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.<br>EO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.<br>From time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.<br>Members' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.<br>Professional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.<br>From time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game.

Let's explore this important new text together from the beginning and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers. Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week. It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of A Course in Miracles, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. A COURSE OF LOVE builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth. Classes are $20 and class cards are available. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. Read more... You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here: http:\/\/crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday ACIM class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing). He produces arts\/cultural\/educational events at the Center, leads Inner Vision Workouts, and works as a CRS Healer and teacher of A Course in Miracles.
