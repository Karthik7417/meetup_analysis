The warm, industrial d\u00e9cor by award winning designers AvroKO draws on cues from traditional New York City butcher shops, in the use of warm wood, stainless steel, and white marble. The space succeeds in being simultaneously rustic, inviting, and luxurious with rich details. Interior details include an homage to a traditional \u201cmeat locker\u201d interior with finished walnut planks covering the length of the downstairs dining room wall, butcher block end\u2011grain wood as the primary material for the staircase, and vintage market scales that have been transformed into a lighting installation in the upstairs dining room. These elements coexist flawlessly with understated accents drawn directly from butcher shop inspiration, such as white ceramic tiles, and chandeliers made of pulleys and large steel butcher hooks.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.qualitymeatsnyc.com\/home.cfm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.qualitymeatsnyc.com\/home.cfm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.qualitymeatsnyc.com\/home.cfm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nSteak &amp; Vino will reside at Holiday Inn Express Times Square:<\/p> <p>$269 King Beds<br\/>$299 Double Double (2 beds)<br\/>$309 Triple\/ Quads (3-4 ppl, 2 beds) These rates include complimentary breakfast and wireless internet access.

Lisa Reisert (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/rachel-mcadams-p334531\">Rachel McAdams<\/a>) is a young woman with more than her share of anxieties about flying. However, when circumstances demand she go to Miami, she gathers her nerves and books a seat on a late-night flight. Sitting next to her is a handsome and charming man named Jackson (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/cillian-murphy-p271775\">Cillian Murphy<\/a>), whom she already met in the airport, but once their jet is safely in the air, Lisa discovers he's not the pleasant traveling companion she imagined. Jackson is part of a terrorist cell plotting to kill the head of Homeland Security, and he's decided to draft Lisa into helping him. While Lisa has no interest in abetting Jackson's plan, he soon reveals he's holding a trump card -- his compatriots are holding Lisa's father hostage, and will kill him if she doesn't cooperate.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/red-eye-v313930\">Red Eye<\/a>\u00a0was the first feature film credit for screenwriter\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/carl-ellsworth-p364741\">Carl Ellsworth<\/a>, who previously scripted episodes of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-v174873\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer<\/a>\u00a0and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/xena-warrior-princess-v281847\">Xena: Warrior Princess<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XP0DdJ6_5xU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XP0DdJ6_5xU<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/226110971\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Red Eye 35mm film print midnight movie at IFC","id":"226110971","time":1445139000000,"updated":1445151286000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":12,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439340384000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be the Sunday after the Escarpment Traverse.

This is a fairly long ascent of 2 miles, fairly comfortable however due to numerous switchbacks. The next good resting spot is the Hunter Lean-to. After the lean-to, we start the gradual descent down to Diamond Notch Falls, a nice little spot to stop for a snack and relax by the falls.<\/p> <p>At this point we are three quarters done and it's onto West Kill mountain via a very long ascent. West Kill has some nice views, a nice chance to pause and admire the view. After West Kill it is approximately 2 miles to St. Anne's Peak, mostly downhill. Then a 400' climb to St. Anne's Peak. After St. Anne's it is 1 mile of downhill to the sharp turn the DP makes on its way the parking lot. The last 1.5 miles is an easy descent down to the parking lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Expect to be hiking for 12-15 hours!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Since we will all be hiking at a different pace, try to find someone in the group who hikes at your pace - don't hike alone!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SOME LONG DISTANCE (20 miles or more) HIKE EXPERIENCE BEFORE DOING THIS HIKE..

It is time to hike and run on some real mountains!<\/p> <p><br\/>I can pick you up in NYC and we'll carpool all together in our RawMobile. As you can see, the number of spots is very limited, so first come first serve. The details about pick up and drop off are below. To reserve a spot just RSVP to this meetup.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/c\/d\/600_440793485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our recent day trips to the Catskills were awesome, so we're doing it again. Some folks were running, some were hiking, but all had fun and made new friends. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/past\/?scroll=true\">our photos and comments from the past trips.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There are lots of ways to enjoy a day at North-South Lake Campground, but the main point of interest to us is probably the <b>famous Escarpment Trail<\/b>. If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not traversing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/b\/8\/600_442244984.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/7\/4\/600_441415156.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/225871614\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytnbxb","time":1445173200000,"updated":1445185598000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"711 12th Ave, Manhattan, NY 10019","name":"711 12th Ave, Manhattan, NY 10019","lon":-73.996437,"id":6418332,"state":"Ne","lat":40.768192,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.30403017998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444098367000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi ladies,<\/p> <p>For those that love food this is the event for you!

There are five mixed borders of trees, shrubs and perennial plants, and five seasonal beds featuring spring bulbs that are followed by annual flower displays.

Frequently, however, this openness masks a reluctance to explore the very traditions out of which we ourselves have emerged. In this series Rev. Robb will take a fresh look at the spiritual insightfulness and moral imagination contained in the teaching of Jesus while emphasizing how they may continue to be revelatory in our current context. It is always surprising to look carefully at the actual words of great teachers with whom we have assumed we were fairly familiar and to discover new ways of understanding and fresh insights of which we were unaware. In this series we will examine in depth some of the stories Jesus told\u2014the parables\u2014which were probably the most characteristic and innovative way he had to convey his own spiritual vision.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>\u00a0Rev.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

This fascia restriction can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention. \u00a0In addition, increased respiratory control and focus have been reported by students.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian\/chakras pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is emphasized to sensations in the body that are grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into vigorous strengthening postures and movement sequences.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p><br\/>Blessings<\/p> <p>Simon Deacon<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00ae \u201cVortexHealing\" is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it.

The novel follows a\u00a0New England\u00a0family and their ancestral home. In the book, Hawthorne explores themes of guilt, retribution, and atonement and colors the tale with suggestions of the supernatural and witchcraft. The setting for the book was inspired by a\u00a0gabled\u00a0house in Salem belonging to Hawthorne's cousin Susanna Ingersoll and by ancestors of Hawthorne who had played a part in the\u00a0Salem Witch Trials\u00a0of 1692. The book was well received upon publication and later had a strong influence on the work of\u00a0H. P. Lovecraft.\u00a0<i>The House of the Seven Gables<\/i>\u00a0has been adapted several times to film and television.\" - wikipedia<\/p> <p><br\/>The novel is set in the mid-19th century, although it includes glimpses into the history of the house, which was built in the late 17th century.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/3\/9\/600_442075865.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________\u00a0<\/p> <p>** <b>NOTE<\/b> : I WILL BE EMAILING MEMBERS ASKING YOU TO CONFIRM YOUR \"YES\" RSVP A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE MEETUP, WITH YOUR REPLY DUE NO LATER THAN APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT SO WE CAN GET A PRETTY ACCURATE HEADCOUNT.

Perfection of agency looks in many ways like the classical virtues. And its culmination bears a strong resemblance to sagehood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In short, Becker claims that modern day reasoning and facts leads to a new Stoicism.<\/p> <p>In this meetup, we'll explore Becker's descriptive argument concerning perfected agency as virtue covered in most of Chapter 6.

Furthermore, the path that the facts about the cultivation of agency points to bears a strong resemblance to many aspects of ancient Stoicism. Perfection of agency looks in many ways like the classical virtues. And its culmination bears a strong resemblance to sagehood.<\/p> <p>In short, Becker claims that modern day reasoning and facts leads to a new Stoicism.<\/p> <p>In this meetup, we'll explore Becker's descriptive argument concerning perfected agency as virtue covered in most of Chapter 6. To prepare, read most, but not all, of Chapter 6 from the beginning up the chapter up to (but not including) the section entitled \"The Argument for Virtue as the Perfection of Agency\". Please take note of any passages you'd like to bring up for discussion while you read.<\/p> <p>If time permits, we'll also attempt to balance Becker's theory with some practice by discussing practical Stoicism applied to our daily lives.<\/p> <p>Below are some focus questions to help guide your reading.

First, if you want to join, we'll be heading to the AMC Loews theater at 312 W 34th St. to see the movie (showtime TBD), and then after we'll walk a few blocks up to our usual spot, the Houndstooth Pub, for discussion of the book and the movie. Then we can really flesh out how the book and the movie compares.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"The Martian\" has become an instant bestseller, topping many favorites lists and nabbing awards. Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him &amp; forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded &amp; completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he\u2019s alive\u2014&amp; even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills\u2014&amp; a relentless, dogged refusal to quit\u2014he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nUpdate: \u00a0 AMC has changed their minds, and they will be showing \"The Martian\" on Sunday after all!

But beneath the surface, she is consumed by thoughts of her sister\u2019s death years earlier in Nigeria. Ella had introduced Angie to Black Power and a vision of returning to Africa. On impulse, Angie travels to Lagos and begins to retrace Ella\u2019s steps. Against a backdrop of the city\u2019s infamous go-slow\u2014traffic as wild and unpredictable as a Fela lyric\u2014she uncovers some harsh truths. For anyone who has wished to be of a different era, this book captures the pain of living vicariously and the exhilaration of finding yourself.<\/p> <p><br\/>***Where to Find the Book***<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1558618643?keywords=into%20the%20go%20slow&amp;qid=1443659957&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1\">Amazon<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/into-the-go-slow-bridgett-davis\/1118594034?ean=9781558618640\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/brooklyn.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/11821961062906_into_the_go-slow\">Brooklyn Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huemanbookstore.com\/book\/9781558618640\">Hue-Man Bookstore<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20308987052907_into_the_go-slow\">New York Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.queenslibrary.org\/node\/1779063\">Queens Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.feministpress.org\/books\/bridgett-m-davis\/go-slow\">The Feminist Press<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club\/events\/225740544\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"\"Into the Go Slow\" by Bridgett M.

EFT is a simple yet incredibly effective method of self healing that can be used to immediately reduce anxiety, stress, and other emotions that stand in our way of living in a place of optimum well-being and personal peace. Together we will do lots of EFT tapping to work on individual and collective issues of concern. The more of us who tap together in a group format, the more benefit can be received by all.<\/p> <p>At this meetup we will continue exploring the nature of our mind and emotions and learn how to identify \u2018stories\u2019 we tell about ourselves that contribute to any sense of personal 'Not-OKness'. Then we can release the charge these stories carry with EFT and increase our personal Emotional Freedom!<\/p> <p><br\/>One of the special features of our Meetup is that we demonstrate how we have unconscious blocks to happiness and Emotional Freedom. Using Energetic Rescripting Process (ERP), a technique that borrows from Kinesiology and EFT, we locate the nature of these blocks and remove them.<\/p> <p><br\/>Even from the demos we do in our Meetups\u00a0people get back to me with\u00a0remarkable stories of how things in their life are shifting\u00a0for the better!<\/p> <p><br\/>Registration for this meeting is requested but not required.

Please no spoilers about the show or books in this newbie friendly environment (including this comment section). Anything already watched by the group as part of the Countdown is fair game to discuss by all, but no discussing the resolutions of things in the presence of our newbies. (Maesters will have their own anything goes events and time after the show). Newbies are of course welcome to theorize and forecast, but those of us who actually know \"shall not pass\" the information!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis week we will be meeting at Stone Creek which has a great menu of affordable eats. (Next week we will most likely continue at Valerian Steel). For the past several years Stone Creek has been home to the coolest Game of Thrones watching parties during the GOT seasons. As we get closer to the season premier we will be at Stone Creek more and more so we can smoothly transition into \"in-season\" mode.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-of-Thrones-Meetup\/events\/225836809\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Game of Thrones Series Recap- Season 1 Episodes 7 & 8","id":"225836809","time":1445200200000,"updated":1445218364000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434343479000,"name":"New York Game of Thrones Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18673544,"urlname":"New-York-Game-of-Thrones-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"352 7th Avenue","name":"Mustang Harry's","lon":-73.992928,"id":15378682,"state":"NY","lat":40.74818,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.19875010848,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440022302000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ravens-Fans-in-NYC\/events\/224749985\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Ravens @ 49ers","id":"224749985","time":1445200200000,"updated":1445213203000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1252764948000,"name":"Ravens Fans in N.Y.C.","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1522432,"urlname":"Ravens-Fans-in-NYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Ravens Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443407684000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\u2022\u00a0LADIES ONLY!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u2022 This game supports the SoccerWithoutBorders Program for Girls in Granada, Nicaragua<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0ABSOLUTELY NO CLEATS ALLOWED per park rules (turf shoes are okay)!

The clear must ferments slowly in 500-liter oak barrels so it becomes quite stable naturally. It matured in those oak barrels for 14-15 months. It has a Burgundian nose, with subtle oak and orange peel, hints of pollen, and beeswax. The palate is very fresh, the grapes were harvested quite early to keep the acidity. The wine ends quite austere. Only part of it went through malolactic fermentation.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Chacra Cincuenta y Cinco Pinot Noir (Rio Negro, Patagonia)\u00a0 $40<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 A very elegant, subtle wine that is light-colored and has floral (roses, lilies) notes alongside wild strawberries and raspberries. It feels light but has very good concentration of flavors and enough clout, while keeping the poise. The tannins feel very refined, there is good freshness and acidity. It should have a very nice evolution in bottle. This would be the proverbial iron fist in a velvet glove. Bravo!<\/p> <p><b>2011 Luca Laborde Double Select Syrah (La Consulta, Mendoza)\u00a0 $26<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 91<\/i> \u2013 Good full, deep red-ruby.\u00a0 Dark berries, <i>kirsch<\/i>, blackberry, dark chocolate, mocha and smoked meat on the nose, plus a whiff of leather.\u00a0 Sweet, lush, pliant and full, with a strong chocolatey ripeness to the intense dark berry flavors.\u00a0 Chewy, mouthfilling Syrah from 50-year-old vines (the vine cuttings originally came from the northern and southern Rhone Valley).\u00a0 Finishes big and broad, with furry tannins and a hint of game.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Bodega Aleanna El Enemigo Cabernet Franc (Valle de Uco, Mendoza)\u00a0 $23<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 90<\/i> \u2013 Dark ruby-red.\u00a0 Lovely violet lift to the aromas of cassis, blackberry, black olive, and licorice.\u00a0 Fresh and aromatic in the mouth, with noteworthy verve to the flavors of sour cherry, flowers, spices, licorice, and mint.\u00a0 Finishes long and lively, with firm but smooth tannins.\u00a0 Carrying a moderate 13.9% alcohol and already long on personality.\u00a0 92% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> -- Austere, lineal and straight with very high acidity. It is very much about the soil, not much about the fruit, but its youth is revealed in the notes of the elevage that are still there: that is cedar wood, peat and graphite. Summarizing, this is an austere, serious, long, tight red that has great potential to age. Drink 2015-2020.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Bodega Aleanna El Enemigo Bonarda (Valle de Uco, Mendoza)\u00a0 $27<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 90<\/i> \u2013 Ripe, rich, and intense, with impressive concentration to the raspberry, dark plum, and kirsch flavors. Very svelte, delivering luscious licorice and spice notes, which linger on the finish with baker's chocolate details.<\/p> <p><b>2006 Carmelo Patti Cabernet Sauvignon (Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon from Perdriel shows orange tints denoting its age. Carmelo Patti likes to release his wines after a long aging in the winery, when he thinks they are ready to drink. There are plenty of aromas of tea leaves, paprika, hints of leather and cured meat plus dried flowers and something earthy. The austere palate shows fully resolved tannins. There is nothing lush about this wine. This superb classically styled Cabernet is tasty, long, and ready to drink. If you want to see what Cabernet can do in Argentina this is a good example. This is like time-traveling.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Achaval Ferrer Quimera (Mendoza)\u00a0 $36<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 92<\/i> \u2013 This dark, compact red leads with a floral note to the racy cassis and cherry puree fruit, well-integrated with fine tannins and bright acidity. Offers a long finish of fruit, mineral, and tobacco. 38% Malbec, 26% Cabernet Franc, 23% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 3% Petit Verdot.<\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 89+?<\/i> -- Good medium ruby.\u00a0 High-pitched aromas of blackberry, blueberry and licorice.\u00a0 Concentrated, juicy and tightly wound, with a slightly high-toned character to the flavors of crushed blackberry, minerals, licorice, and bitter chocolate.\u00a0 Almost tart today, this firm, vibrant, very young wine needs time in bottle and may ultimately merit an outstanding rating.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group\/events\/225784636\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Argentina ABM (Anything But Malbec)","id":"225784636","time":1445203800000,"updated":1445389347000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403902580000,"name":"Westchester BYOB Wine Tasting Group","group_lon":-73.8600006104,"id":15362102,"urlname":"Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group","group_lat":41.0800018311,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"31-20 21st Ave, Astoria","name":"Grace Lutheran Church","lon":-73.908356,"id":24114673,"state":"NY","lat":40.777882,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.69619941711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443209179000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Getting into our Right Mind: The Practice of Meditation<br\/>with Alex Bonano<\/b><\/p> <p>At the moment, we do not recognize the vast potential of the mind.\u00a0 We relate to a mind that feels stuck in negativity, and we experience the world as a place of problems and suffering that we can do little to change.

He'll talk about their localization process (and why we stopped using Google's app translation service), strategies for avoiding layout issues (with some examples of embarrassing ones), date &amp; time formatting, sorting (which turns out not to even be computable for some languages), and why all this localization work still isn't enough. Plus he'll try to share some numbers from Meetup's recent launch in Japanese.<\/p> <p>\n\n<i>\"How Do We Show All This Stuff\" by Liam Spradlin, mobile designer at touchlab. <\/i><br\/>He'll talk about information density vs. hierarchy, why white space isn't wasted space, and dealing with showing too much data.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>\"Sympli: Collaboration for Designers and Developers\" by\u00a0<\/i><i>Max Ignatyev, Founder of Sympli\u00a0<\/i><br\/>As we all know, designers and developers speak very different languages. \u00a0Max Ignatyev was the lead Developer on the Washington Post app and had issues going back and forth between designers (trying to figure out where files where, what colors were used, distances, etc.) and it would take hours for him to get this information, having no way to efficiently communicate with other people on his team. In order to overcome that, he actually created Sympli, which functions as a plugin for Photoshop, Sketch, Xcode and Android Studio, and also has a web app so that that back and forth communication and sharing would happen in 1-click.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe also have news about<b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bigapps.nyc\/p\/\">NYC Big Apps<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 Opportunity to win $25K:<br\/><\/b><i>NYC is awarding $25K to a solution to improve the way New Yorkers experience living in NYC.

A child of the \u201980s born of hippie parents, LaMarche is now a new mother in her 30s; her observations on parenting and marriage are especially humorous, including a brief index of common parenting mistakes, in which she shoots down both sides of such questions as whether to breastfeed, co-sleep, use disposable diapers, etc. LaMarche is entertaining and fresh; readers will want to savor this sassy, offbeat commentary<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club\/events\/223563140\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Author Event - Una LaMarche - Unabrow.","id":"223563140","time":1445293800000,"updated":1445560526000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1300804164000,"name":"The New York Girly Book Club","group_lon":-74,"id":1802703,"urlname":"The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":7.77711200714,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444076248000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out on a Monday night \u00a0after a long day of work for Happy Hour at El Cantinero.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Tony was raised in Bellingham, Washington (90 miles north of Seattle) and spent most of his time as a child exploring the woods behind his parents house. At 19 after visiting Bruce Lee's grave in Seattle, and taking his first photo with a disposable camera, he bought his first camera. He promptly broke it and bought his first SLR. At 21 he moved to Seattle to pursue photography and in fall of 2000 moved to NYC, the center of the world.<\/p> <p>Tony teaches photographic lighting at FIT in NYC, he has also taught at Parsons the New School for Design and SVA in NYC, judged photo contests, and has traveled the country leading workshops for American Photographic Artists.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/9\/4\/600_443025460.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops\/events\/226023169\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":12600000,"name":"Shooting Landscapes with the Sony a7R II with Tony Gale","id":"226023169","time":1445371200000,"updated":1445384917000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1396546420000,"name":"Free NYC Photography Workshops","group_lon":-74,"id":13710502,"urlname":"Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Photographers & Videographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1300 York Avenue","name":"Weill Cornell Medical College","lon":-73.954788,"id":24158545,"state":"NY","lat":40.764992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.11826133728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445193181000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/1\/9\/600_443180761.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>During protest #2, students, faculty and staff at Weill Cornell Medicine where Dr. Glimcher is the Dean, were given a handout defending Dr. Glimcher, and they were asked to ignore us.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

In the moments right before her death, the QUEEN curses KAULDER with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today KAULDER is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to KAULDER, the QUEEN WITCH is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race.<\/p> <p><b>Social Media\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Hashtag:\u00a0 #LastWitchHunter #AxeAndCross<\/p> <p>Facebook: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LastWitchHunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Twitter \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/LastWitchHunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Instagram:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/lastwitchhunter<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>IN THEATRES OCTOBER 23<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Tickets will be under NYC Dads Group list with your name.

You will have about 20 minutes to get the advice you need, and then the roles will reverse and you will be paired with someone you can help with your skill set.

Hazelcast provides many distributed and highly scalable data structures such as Map, Queue, Lock and Executor Service. It also has many powerful capabilities like listeners, WAN replication, and query functionality. It is possible to implement applications that are very scalable and capable. However, power comes with responsibility and misuse can cause degrading performance and application scalability. In this talk, we will talk about some of the best practices and mistakes to avoid while using Hazelcast. We assume that the audience is familiar with Hazelcast or an alternative IMDG. You will leave this session knowing the core principles and best practices for the following features: - WAN Replication<br\/>- Queries<br\/>- Listeners<br\/>- Executor Service<br\/>- Queue<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Introduction to Hazelcast Discovery SPI<\/b><\/p> <p>This is a short session that gives you a preview into the Discover Client SPI, and how you can leverage it to bring Hazelcast to even more cloud platforms! \u00a0We'll take a look at challenges that Ray ran into prior to the SPI when trying to use Hazelcast on Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes. \u00a0With the SPI, it's now very easy to implement Hazelcast node discovery for many different cloud platforms.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Ray Tsang<\/b> is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.

We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/226067301\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytnbbc","time":1445380200000,"updated":1445393334000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 228-6226","address_1":"248 Mercer St (between 3rd St and 4th St)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-74,"id":490856,"state":"NY","lat":40.72,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415805169000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to make comics but you're feeling stuck?

As a young mother trapped in a nightmare of domestic abuse, she found the courage to turn her bitterness into action, propelled by her realization that it is women who suffer most during conflicts--and that the power of women working together can create an unstoppable force.

Rosenbloom's first company Handshake.com offered web software that enabled consumers to automatically schedule services with a variety of service businesses. But the company strayed from its original mission and attempted to build a big web front-end to drive customers to its business customers. In the end, this proved cost-ineffective and was dropped. \"After raising over $20M in financing, I realized we may have overfunded the business,\" Rosenbloom recalls.<\/p> <p><br\/>\"I learned a lot then that I applied to the founding of Brontes,\" referring to the dental imaging company that he co-founded with Founder Collective partner Eric Paley. \"You have to be extremely disciplined. You have to be careful not to become too dependent on venture capital and build a real business.\" But fortunately, Brontes was allowed to grow on its own, on a trim budget, before it was sold.<\/p> <p>Before entering the start-up world, Rosenbloom put in time at the Endeavor talent agency in Los Angeles. There, he briefly worked as an assistant to one of the agents at the agency famed for being the backdrop of the HBO hit series Entourage (\"I was Lloyd, essentially,\" Rosenbloom says). \"Hollywood is surprisingly similar to venture capital,\" he remarks. \"It's about bringing the script, the star, and some of the writers together around a great project.\"<br\/>Rosenbloom sees Founder Collective's advantage as its ability and willingness, as a committed early-stage investor, to play an active role in supporting and digging into the endeavors it backs, rather than sitting passively by and hoping for the best. \"We're really hands-on guys,\" he says of Founder Collective's founding partners. \"We're not career investors, we're start-up guys. With early-stage stuff, you can get really hands-on, and put things together and shepherd things along, and I think we're in a good position to do that. I think the strategy plays really well to our strengths.\" He also noted Founder Collective's advantage vis-a-vis larger funds: \"there's a gap in terms of where the funding is. Big funds have to go after big deals, but we're not such a small fund that we can only put in $200,000--we can go quite a bit further.\"<br\/>In late 2010 Micah helped co-found Sample6, a company developing breakthrough technologies to better protect the food supply. \"I've tried to stay away from following trends and build stuff that has a tangible impact on humanity.\"<\/p> <p>Having built 3 start-ups and raised 4 rounds of venture capital, Micah has now joined Founder Collective full-time to lead the NYC office. \u201cThe NY scene is truly energized right now, and I want to help entrepreneurs build the next generation of great companies here and beyond.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/njtech\/events\/221555230\/","yes_rsvp_count":90,"name":"NJ Tech Meetup 65 w\/ Micah Rosenbloom, Founder Collective (Managing Partner)","id":"221555230","time":1445381100000,"updated":1445455069000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1271697765000,"name":"NJ Tech Meetup","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1633095,"urlname":"njtech","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NJ Tech'ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444625458000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1202182087\/time-totalk-find-your-conversation\">*Check out CNY's first Kickstarter Campaign!<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>----<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Free. \u00a0Open to public author event.<\/b><\/p> <p>The University Seminars\u00a0 on Innovation in Education\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 &amp;<\/p> <p>Ethics, Moral Education, and Society\u00a0<br\/>present\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>RECLAIMING CONVERSATION<\/i><i>\u00a0Speaker:\u00a0Prof. Sherry Turkle, M.I.T.<\/i><i>author,\u00a0Reclaiming Conversation:\u00a0<br\/>The Power of Talk in a Digital Age<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Tuesday, October\u00a020, 2015<\/i><i>,\u00a07-9 PM\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Faculty House, Columbia University\u00a0<br\/>Please see location\/directions below<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/>Sherry Turkle \u2013 renowned media scholar, tenured professor at MIT, and author of theNew York Times<\/i>\u00a0bestseller\u00a0<i>Alone Together<\/i>\u00a0\u2013 has spent the last thirty years studying the psychology of our relationship with technology.

Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from.
