Through their innovation and hard work, the organization has been able to provide its members with educational resources, a valuable Newsletter, Workshops, Adventures, Children's Parties, Special Interest and Support Groups, and much more. As TMC has grown over the years to serve more than 350 families, we continue to work hard to help all mothers in various times of need. In addition to supporting our members, we give to the local community through a variety of fund-raising efforts. <\/p>\n<p>TMC was created not only to provide resources and fun things for mothers to do with their children, but to serve as a venue for mothers to share and build their skills by volunteering to help maintain this growing organization. TMC is entirely volunteer based. It's about both giving and giving back to our community. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of being a member, and to also contribute in any way they can. There is always an opportunity to volunteer and share your skills and experience with TMC.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <br><\/strong><\/p>","lon":-71.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/c\/3\/highres_444347299.jpeg","photo_id":444347299,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/c\/3\/600_444347299.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/c\/3\/thumb_444347299.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194045878,"name":"TMC President","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/0\/0\/9\/highres_250520489.jpeg","photo_id":250520489,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/0\/0\/9\/member_250520489.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/0\/0\/9\/thumb_250520489.jpeg"}},"members":134,"name":"The Mother Connection","id":19023299,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Mother-Connection","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.6500015259,"who":"Parents"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Quincy","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444746315000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-foreclosures","name":"Real Estate Foreclosures","id":15516},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"beginner-new-real-estate-investor","name":"Beginner Real Estate Investing","id":46403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Quincy-Real-Estate-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Networking is the key to success in Real Estate.

If you have been playing for some time I am sure you will find a lot of new and helpful ideas as well. If the level will be very different then we might divide it to two groups eventually. <br> <br>Half of the class time is dedicated to a consecutive curriculum. I try to choose themes that are relevant to everybody in the class. We might talk about some aspects of technique, or reading, or theory etc. The other half of the class time I usually help students with their individual questions. <br> <br>I see this class as a supportive and motivational environment for your self-teaching process. <br> <br>This is PAY-WHAT-YOU-WANT class. We kindly ask you to support your teachers and Westland Guitars that provided the space. <br> <br>There are two professional guitar teachers for you: David and Anastasiya. We lead the class together.

When you give this a try, you'll be able to meet quality local singles that live near you. Why waste time with dead end relationships when you will feel far better connecting with someone special you can actually see face-to-face? According to recent studies, Americans are marrying later. In fact, as of 2014, single people in the United States outnumber the married,1 meaning that if you are currently single, you\u2019re in good company! One reason for this could be that the demands of modern life don\u2019t leave much time to look for love: with the typical US work week now at 47 hours or more,2 singles who want to get a toe on the professional ladder are finding their leisure time is at a premium. Of course, just because increasing numbers who are finding themselves single, it doesn\u2019t mean that they wish to stay that way. DJ Chris Fiores Singles Dance Party is an enjoyable, relaxing and social way to meet hundreds of professional local singles. Join Us this and every Friday Night at Angelica's 49 S Main St, Middleton, MA. Never a cover charge. Plenty of free parking. Dine, Dance, Mix, Mingle and Meet Someone New And Exciting.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the greater Boston Area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50+, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net? <br>Stitch.net is an online community, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Please Note: <br>-People attending these meetups may just be members on Stitch.net, and not a member of this Meetup group. -Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event posted in this Meetup group. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees.

We are looking for folks interested in playing technical, small-sided games that we hold in Dorchester\/Boston. We play year round. During winter, we play futsal indoors. During warmer months, we play small-sided games outdoors, ranging from street\/court surfaces to small-sided turf pitches. We've started this group because we'd like to have more people join the regular games that we host, and we hope to meet some folks that will \"get\" the club and might be interested in staying involved (no pressure though). In general, our games prioritize skill, strategy, and team play over physical brutality and aggression. Indoors, we typically play 4 v 4 with small goals, no keepers, and an official futsal ball on a basketball court. Outdoors, we most often play 4 v 4 (or 5 v 5) on a small-sided turf field with a size 5 ball; sometimes we also will play a street game on a street hockey rink with a street\/futsal ball. ABOUT UPSETTERS FC: We are a diverse club based in Dorchester, focused on technical, small-sided games. We are a real club, with a family feel, an interest in design and community, and an appreciation for reggae music. We hold several regular club events (tournaments, parties, trips, etc.) and try and keep things interesting by playing friendlies with like-minded clubs. Sometimes we play in leagues, but often we find we enjoy playing and training together more than league play (and we've been successful in leagues). The focus of our sessions is overwhelmingly on \"open\" play, but we sometimes integrate games that feature a tactical\/team component. Our vibe is laid back and friendly, but we appreciate a good game, particularly one that flows well and features lots of movement of the ball and players. We have good players, and are looking for more, but more so we are looking for good people who will appreciate our weekly game and our club. We like dope uniforms and gear. Men and women are welcome; this probably isn't the best environment for real novices, but we welcome those \"returning\" to the game and those that have recently fallen in love with it. We don't tolerate ultra-competitive BS and those that mess up the vibe we've worked hard to create over the years.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194595716,"name":"hureauinho","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/highres_250858559.jpeg","photo_id":250858559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/member_250858559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/b\/f\/thumb_250858559.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Dorchester Small-Sided Soccer & Futsal","id":19061291,"state":"MA","urlname":"Dorchester-Small-Sided-Soccer-Futsal","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"players"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445841239000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"angel-investors","name":"Angel Investors","id":29000},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"artificial-intelligence-applications","name":"Artificial Intelligence Applications","id":90163},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"biotechnology","name":"Biotechnology","id":109595},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"web-application-security","name":"Web Application Security","id":161342}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonInternetStartups\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Chapter of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pro\/GlobalInternetStartups\/\">Global Internet Startups <\/a>Meetup group, Boston Internet Startups (<b>BOIS<\/b>) was founded in October 2015 and it is one of the fastest growing startup communities in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Our events empower entrepreneurs by connecting people and creating opportunities for companies to develop new businesses, meet customers, launch new products, promote their brands and expand their markets.<\/p>\n<p><b>BOIS<\/b> strives to help: Entrepreneurs, Students, Techies, Startups, Investors, Mentors and Advisors.<\/p>\n<p>This group will: Host great events, get you involved, connect people and help you take action.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Join, Participate and Enjoy! \u263a<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.iias-iisa.org\/egpa\/wp-content\/uploads\/Boston-skyline.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p>Home to some of USA's hottest startups, <b>Boston<\/b> is an emerging force in the world of innovation.

I've had numerous opportunities to provide emotional support to others while, engaging them with my knowledge of computers and technology, providing them with a means to advance their careers while, providing me with the opportunity to be creative.

In some respects this group is experimental but in others I may find a way to structure conversations with certain rules so the experience is more practical and less free-form.

Meeting up for dinner one or two nights a week and trying different restaurants (Bukhara, Acapulcos, city feed) and others that are here. We could also maybe meet up once a week for trivia night at one of the bars or try a different bar once a week. As the group gets to know each other we could do pot luck dinners, movie nights and whatever else we fancy. We can even play tennis or shoot hoops.

Medicine X is a catalyst for new ideas about the future of medicine and health care. The initiative explores how emerging technologies will advance the practice of medicine, improve health, and empower patients to be active participants in their own care. Such emerging technologies include those that are: largely digital (e.g., online peer-to-peer healthcare communities, wearables); \u2022 methodological (e.g., human-centered design and innovation, service design); \u2022 cultural (e.g., participatory medicine, doctors and patients functioning as designers); \u2022 and more. This group is intended to bring together (e)patients, healthcare providers, experience designers, technologists, and researchers. The group will offer opportunities to hear from key members of these communities, experience emerging technologies, collaborate on projects, and more.

Gabriel Baldwin, group founder, has been working with clients since 2014 after his personal journey of letting go of stuff enabled him to majorly downsize his housing situation, move on from a 'good' job that wasn't serving him to pursue his passions while having a blast along the way.","lon":-71.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14391765,"name":"Gabriel Baldwin","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/highres_251138987.jpeg","photo_id":251138987,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/member_251138987.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/4\/b\/thumb_251138987.jpeg"}},"members":94,"name":"Less Stuff, More Joy - Boston","id":19092819,"state":"MA","urlname":"LessStuffMoreJoyBoston","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Simplifiers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brighton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446739264000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"fun-singles","name":"Fun Singles","id":20103},{"urlkey":"fun-singles-friends","name":"Fun Singles & Friends","id":20108},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-singles-singles","name":"Singles, Singles, Singles","id":115707},{"urlkey":"single-adventurers","name":"Single adventurers","id":156403},{"urlkey":"singles-group-singles-30s-and-over","name":"Singles group; Singles 30s and over;","id":625622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Singles-Life-Journey\/","rating":5,"description":"<p> Welcome to the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Singles-Life-Journey\/\">Single's Life Journey<\/a>&nbsp;<span>\u2013 A Higher Love Singles Group\u201d This is not your average Singles group.

We will build a network of friends for our kids who relate, provide leadership, and support one another. We will do this by arranging short events in which they can get to know new friends at short events such as playing Frisbee, seeing a movie, a guest speaker, eating out, going to the beach, hiking, or just hanging out and talking. The idea is that us parents stay nearby while the kids have fun together for an hour or so at different locations each week or so, and we give them a break....from us.

Stacki does this at scale, so deploying 1000+ servers is no more complex than deploying one. Once your servers are installed with Stacki, you can augment them with configuration tools like Puppet, Chef, Salt, CFEngine, Ansible, etc. \n\n\n\nVisit www.stacki.com to learn more. \n\nAnd join the Stacki community here: https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/stacki","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196020351,"name":"Colleen Harig","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/highres_251655689.jpeg","photo_id":251655689,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/member_251655689.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/d\/4\/9\/thumb_251655689.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"StackiLab Boston","id":19173259,"state":"MA","urlname":"StackiLab-Boston","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Stackiens"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Quincy","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449014343000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"masterminds","name":"MasterMinds","id":15392},{"urlkey":"influence","name":"Influence","id":19483},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"personal-growth-development","name":"Personal Growth & Development","id":21726},{"urlkey":"personal-self-growth-empowerment","name":"Personal Self Growth & Empowerment","id":27503},{"urlkey":"masterminding","name":"Masterminding","id":59780},{"urlkey":"intentional-masterminds","name":"Intentional Masterminds","id":67954},{"urlkey":"influence-and-leadership","name":"Influence and leadership","id":1275112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/South-Shore-Explosive-Growth-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"Leadership expert, John C.
