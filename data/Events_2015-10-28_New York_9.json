J. Snyder. As architect for the Board of Education, Snyder revolutionized the city\u2019s schools during his thirty-year career, which coincided with the span of the Progressive Era. He used innovative construction techniques for health and safety. By providing amenities such as gymnasiums, auditoriums, and science laboratories, he transformed the simple 19th-century schoolhouse consisting of just classrooms into the complex 20th-century school building that we know today. And he \u201cdid that which no other architect before his time ever tried or did,\u201d said Jacob Riis, \u201che built them beautiful.\u201d More than half of Snyder\u2019s 400 school buildings and additions still function today as public schools. Architect and historian Robers A. M. Stern has deemed them \u201ceveryday masterpieces, among the great glories of our city.\u201d The history of Snyder\u2019s schools shows how the United States has contributed to the provision of universal public education, especially in New York City, which remains today the largest public-school system in the country, as it was in Snyder\u2019s day.

He was in the very first digital reporting class taught at the Columbia Journalism School in 1995, and was hired by Time Inc. to launch the website for Peoplemagazine while still in school. He later helped bring Time and other magazines into the digital age, and created one of the Web\u2019s first original daily news outlets, called The Netly News, which chronicled the Internet's effect on everything from reading to retail and music. He\u2019s interviewed many of the key figures in digital history, including the inventor of the web, the coder who first distributed MP3 music, two of Twitter's creators, the lead designer of the iPod, and even asked Bill Gates whether he was a bigger fan of Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk or Jean-Luc Picard (he chose Kirk). After freelance writing for outlets including The New York Times, Outside, Discovery, and GQ, Noah was named the editor-in-chief of the gadget blog Gizmodo in 2005. Noah has appeared as a commentator on CNN, ABC, and MTV, was an associate producer for the Emmy-winning TV Nation, a writer for the VH1 series When Star Wars Ruled The World, and hosted a weekly on-air segment on NY1 News for several years. Noah joined Fast Company in 2008 to oversee its digital editorial strategy and launch a network of sites including Co.Design, which won a National Magazine Award in 2011.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Panelists:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mine.nyc\/\">Denis Nazarov<\/a><\/b>\u00a0|\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/minemeta\">@minemeta<\/a><br\/>Denis Nazarov (born in Moscow, lives in New York) holds a BFA in Photography from New York University.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/224983384\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytnbcc","time":1445468400000,"updated":1445482775000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"303 Lafayette St","name":"REI Soho @ The Puck Building ","lon":-73.99572,"id":8401532,"state":"NY","lat":40.724594,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.78456807137,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442337657000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/4\/7\/600_435554151.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>Course Overview <\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Are you looking for a fun winter sport?

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

The most important aspect of all your social media campaigns is creating original content to drive people to your web site so that your SEO increases. (Search engine optimization) Translated, this means that you will show high when someone does a Google search for a product or service you offer.<\/p> <p>On October 22, we will be treated to a presentation by Rupa Kale, a Summit\/New Providence B.I.G. member who owns Bottle &amp; Bottega in Berkeley Heights and who just earned a prestigious social media marketing award by her company. Our meeting will be from 10-11:30 at Twin Maples, 214 Springfield Ave. in Summit.<\/p> <p>Last month we had over 25 people attend. We expect at least that this month. With such a nice-sized group, there is going to be a vast range in the amount of knowledge of the women in the room. That is a good thing. While some of us were able to share the best URL shortener and link management platforms, others were asking what a hash tag is. The beauty of BIG is that we can all help and support each other!

If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226160165\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Thursday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226160165","time":1445547600000,"updated":1445560441000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 45th Street (Between 6th & 7th Ave.)","name":"Cranberry Cafe","lon":-73.94519,"id":6580602,"state":"NY","lat":40.813438,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.9805932045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423802479000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTICE: While we officially start at 5pm, please feel free to join us anytime after 5pm.

How did life start on planet earth 3.5 billion years ago, and which molecules \/ chemical systems lead to biology? Could evolution be the ultimate creationist? Is there are general theory of evolution that extends to all matter? Can we make or evolve life from scratch in a matter of hours? These are fantastically interesting questions but in this lecture, rather than look back into the past, we will look to the future and discuss how chemists may go about creating new types of truly synthetic (artificial or inorganic biology). In embarking upon this quest we will be asking the question \u201cWhat is the minimal chemical system that can undergo Darwinian evolution?\u201d and in doing so looking towards the concept of \u2018adaptive matter\u2019 and evolvable materials and chemical systems. The aim is inorganic biology, or more simply, a living system that does not the current chemical infrastructure utilized by biology.<\/p> <p>We will not only discuss abstract concepts, but real chemistry and experiments that we have constructed in Glasgow, see the photo below. Importantly a rigorous experimental approach will be debated that will allow peers to scrutinize and test the validity of our approach to the production of autonomous chemical entities capable of replication and adaptive behavior.<\/p> <p>Reception: starts 6.00<br\/>Lecture start time: 7.30<br\/>Close: 8.30<\/p> <p>Refreshments and drinks included.<\/p> <p>Lee Cronin FRSE. Professional Career: 2013-Regius Professor of Chemistry. Alexander von Humboldt research fellow (Uni. of Bielefeld);[masked]: Research fellow (Uni. of Edinburgh); 1997: Ph.D. Bio-Inorganic Chemistry, Uni. of York; 1994 BSc. Chemistry, First Class, Uni. of York. Prizes include 2015 RSC Tilden Prize, 2013 BP\/RSE Hutton Prize, 2012 RSC Corday Morgan, 2011 RSC Bob Hay Lectureship, a Wolfson-Royal Society Merit Award in 2009, Election to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009. The focus of Cronin\u2019s work is understanding and controlling self-assembly and self-organisation in Chemistry to develop functional molecular and nano-molecular chemical systems (including solar fuel systems); linking architectural design with function and recently engineering system-level functions (e.g. coupled catalytic self-assembly, emergence of inorganic materials and fabrication of inorganic cells that allow complex cooperative behaviours). Much of this work is converging on exploring the assembly and engineering of emergent chemical systems aiming towards \u2018inorganic biology\u2019. This work has been presented in over 320 papers and 280 lectures worldwide. It is also worth pointing out that the expertise in the Cronin group (which numbers over 50 people and &gt; \u00a310 M in funding) is unique bringing together inorganic \/ synthetic chemists, chemical engineers, flow chemistry, digital chemistry, complex system modelling, evolutionary theory, robotics and AI.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYCSkeptics-Meetup-Group\/events\/225533565\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"The Evolutionary Genesis Engine - An Evening With Lee Cronin (Lecture 7:30pm)","id":"225533565","time":1445551200000,"updated":1445563874000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1173640321000,"name":"The New York City Skeptics Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":448750,"urlname":"The-NYCSkeptics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Skeptics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11040","country":"us","city":"New Hyde Park","address_1":"2232 Jericho Turnpike","name":"Bramasole Italian Restaurant","lon":-73.666412,"id":17068042,"state":"Ne","lat":40.739086,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":16.9901714325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442022599000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/2\/c\/600_6206668.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Psychic Night! and FREE MINGLE\u00a0 @ 6pm -9pm <\/b><\/p> <p>ALL Welcomed.

In this session we will explore an important adjacent-role of the database, to efficiently perform computations and create derived data.<\/p> <p>Relational databases have been successful for several decades now because they provide a well defined computational framework, which is built on top of relational algebra. The relational algebra defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data.<\/p> <p>However, times change and we are presently in a situation where relational databases do not easily scale to the amounts of data that businesses and organizations around the world are dealing with. NoSQL technology has emerged as an attempt to address this, but NoSQL loses the computational aspect. The majority of NoSQL databases are glorified key-value stores that support CRUD operations, but do not define a solid computational model.<\/p> <p>Alternatively, MapReduce defines a computational framework to process large amounts of data, but has its own caveats. It encourages batch processing and full-scans of data, so the computation becomes detached from stored data.<\/p> <p>It is our belief that the data management industry will move into the direction of consolidating storage, which will allow computing power and new databases to emerge; these will both scale to data storage needs as well as provide a solid online computational framework.<\/p> <p>This session will teach you about a computing engine that is built into the database and allows arbitrary JavaScript-based code to be executed directly in the database, next to the data.<\/p> <p>This setup provides a simple and powerful computational model that ensures data is accessed through efficient indices directly in the database, thus massively accelerating data manipulation operations.<\/p> <p>Throughout this talk, we will present examples of how advanced computation can be done directly in the database, including an analysis of geospatial data, and the application of statistical model-like logistic regression to derive predictions.<\/p> <p><b>Jurgis Orups, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Clusterpoint<\/b><\/p> <p>Jurgis co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Clusterpoint.com\">Clusterpoint<\/a> in 2006.<\/p> <p>Prior to that, he spent 6-years managing a team building large-scale Internet crawler and search technology.

In this session we will explore an important adjacent-role of the database, to efficiently perform computations and create derived data.<\/p> <p>Relational databases have been successful for several decades now because they provide a well defined computational framework, which is built on top of relational algebra. The relational algebra defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data.<\/p> <p>However, times change and we are presently in a situation where relational databases do not easily scale to the amounts of data that businesses and organizations around the world are dealing with. NoSQL technology has emerged as an attempt to address this, but NoSQL loses the computational aspect. The majority of NoSQL databases are glorified key-value stores that support CRUD operations, but do not define a solid computational model.<\/p> <p>Alternatively, MapReduce defines a computational framework to process large amounts of data, but has its own caveats. It encourages batch processing and full-scans of data, so the computation becomes detached from stored data.<\/p> <p>It is our belief that the data management industry will move into the direction of consolidating storage, which will allow computing power and new databases to emerge; these will both scale to data storage needs as well as provide a solid online computational framework.<\/p> <p>This session will teach you about a computing engine that is built into the database and allows arbitrary JavaScript-based code to be executed directly in the database, next to the data.<\/p> <p>This setup provides a simple and powerful computational model that ensures data is accessed through efficient indices directly in the database, thus massively accelerating data manipulation operations.<\/p> <p>Throughout this talk, we will present examples of how advanced computation can be done directly in the database, including an analysis of geospatial data, and the application of statistical model-like logistic regression to derive predictions.<\/p> <p><b>Jurgis Orups, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Clusterpoint<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Jurgis co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Clusterpoint.com\">Clusterpoint<\/a> in 2006.<\/p> <p>Prior to that, he spent 6-years managing a team building large-scale Internet crawler and search technology.

It has grown from being a concept embraced by a small number of companies such as The Body Shop in the early 1990s to a widespread global movement. At its weakest level, it is represented by a few philanthropic gestures by organisations, but when applied in its most complete form, it can steer the organization or sector to deliver a fully-fledged, system-wide, multi-stakeholder operation, accompanied by multiple types of certification.<\/p> <p>For the first time, a book brings together key issues relating to CSR as they apply to different aspects of business; it is not another generalist title about CSR. Michael Hopkins, a leading expert in the field, is joined by a number of outstanding contributors to the book, to explain how CSR has evolved since the 1990s and to offer ground-breaking insights and practical and specific applications of the concept. For example, Mervyn King explains Integrating Reporting, Deborah Leipziger looks at CSR, Branding and the Supply Chain, George Starcher provides a framework for Socially Responsible Restructuring, and Adrian Henriques explores Social Accounting and Stakeholder Dialogue.<\/p> <p>* A one-stop reference book for professionals and students of CSR<\/p> <p>* Contributions from leading specialists in the application of CSR<\/p> <p>* Translates well-established theories into practical tools<\/p> <p>We have to make charge to ensure we have a properly set up room ($20).

It is gem of a show on Adult Swim that is easy to miss. It stars a super scientist and his young grandson in a host of nutty comedic adventures.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you watch just one episode you may be tempted to disregard it because of the juvenile humor (burping, etc) that entertains the weak of mind. This would be a mistake. Rick &amp; Morty is actually a brilliant exploration of various science fiction tropes. In a meaner reworking of Back to the Future's zany super-scientist Emmet Brown, Rick Sanchez takes a young wide-eyed high school student Marty McFly on various adventures. However, in today's modern world an old scientist frequently sneaking off alone with a teen would be considered far creepier than it was in the 80's. Therefore they have swapped out \"Marty\" for \"Morty\", Sanchez's 14 year old grandson (see, a lot less creepy!). Together they use comedy to deconstruct, from unexpected and unique angles, various sci-fi, television, and real world assumptions. Some of these shows are simply brilliant and hilarious. (How they portray the Borg is simply too funny to be believed).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nSo come hang out with us.

This book is really charming and delightful, and I think it will be interesting to see how this book (written in 2014) addresses futuristic notions of gender and race, albeit in a much lighter setting!<\/p> <p>From Goodreads:<\/p> <p>Somewhere within our crowded sky, a crew of wormhole builders hops from planet to planet, on their way to the job of a lifetime. To the galaxy at large, humanity is a minor species, and one patched-up construction vessel is a mere speck on the starchart. This is an everyday sort of ship, just trying to get from here to there.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But all voyages leave their mark, and even the most ordinary of people have stories worth telling. A young Martian woman, hoping the vastness of space will put some distance between herself and the life she\u2018s left behind. An alien pilot, navigating life without her own kind. A pacifist captain, awaiting the return of a loved one at war.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Set against a backdrop of curious cultures and distant worlds, this episodic tale weaves together the adventures of nine eclectic characters, each on a journey of their own.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPS - I'm also going to drop a couple books from our current list as they're not getting a lot of love in the polls.

This discussion will demonstrate how project management can not only co-exist with your agile process, but thrive. Plus, you'll learn how Gilt blends agile principles with traditional project management techniques to bring their strategic initiatives to life.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>Justin Riservato has been an integral part of Gilt\u2019s growth since 2009. Justin has worked with just about every team and department at Gilt, developing a direct, \u201ctell the truth\u201d approach and philosophy to project communication that has improved both collaboration and trust across teams. From his past life of living and working on sailboats, Justin has been able to draw numerous parallels between program management and working on a ship\u2014at least the way he does it!<\/p> <p>7:40PM<\/p> <p>Just-In-Time Business Operations (Yeah, there's an add-on for that!)<\/p> <p>by\u00a0Ethan Foulkes, Camerican<\/p> <p>Learn how Camerican International, one of the worlds largest food import\/export companies, has integrated numerous add-ons in Confluence to build a custom CRM on a limited budget and without any in-house programmers. The Atlassian ecosystem is full of existing add-ons you can use, as well as developers looking for new ideas to build. Understanding how to manage multiple add-ons and work with the various vendors is the key to unlocking huge value. Come see what\u2019s possible!<\/p> <p>About the speaker:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Always an IT nerd at heart Ethan started off his career in tech support, originally in dial-up modem support and eventually as a Network Security Engineer. In his early 20's he departed from this promising career track to play professional poker. 8 years later, having successfully competed at the highest levels it was time for a new challenge. In his current role, Ethan develops custom business tools by extending Confluence through add-ons. His people skills, honed through years of poker playing, help him to understand what motivates people and use that to drive adoption of those tools. Ethan has an amazing wife and an energetic 5 year old son who keeps him active. Time is valuable but he still manages to find enough to help run the NYC Atlassian User Group.<\/p> <p>8:00PM<\/p> <p>Agile Development with Chuck Norris<\/p> <p>by Madhusudhan Matrubai, Barclays<\/p> <p>The session gives a brief overview on the challenges that an Agile development team faced before adopting agile tools, it walks through on how adopting the Chuck Norris suite transformed an ordinary Agile team into power packed ChuckAgile Team. The suite consists of various Atlassian tools like Confluence, Jira, Bitbucket (including Stash), Bamboo and Jira Service Desk and is referred here as \"Chuck Norris\" for obvious reasons of agility, flexibility, traceability and various other adjectives. The session highlights on how the integration between these tools contributed for a greater transparency, traceability, collaboration and increased productivity. Agility redefined by Chuck Norris.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>Entered into the earth portal from the city of Bangalore, India. Did my Bachelors of Engineering in Instrumentation Technology from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore - India. I have over 13 yrs of Experience in IT and have performed various kinds of roles and I like my current role in the DevOps area in the banking industry in Big Apple.<\/p> <p>8:20PM<\/p> <p>More eating, drinking, networking!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/aug.atlassian.com\/cities\/newyorkny\/annualpre-summitbash","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/augnyc\/events\/226083884\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Annual Pre-Summit Bash!","id":"226083884","time":1445554800000,"updated":1445610023000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377527897000,"name":"Atlassian User Group NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":9975812,"urlname":"augnyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10016","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"171 Madison Ave., Suite 908","name":"Madison Wellness Center","lon":-73.983391,"id":1527297,"state":"NY","lat":40.747391,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":45,"headcount":0,"distance":0.390693575144,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444855557000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Greetings Dear Friends,<\/b><\/p> <p>Greetings Dear Friends,<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session, we'll release conditioning that keeps us stuck in bad habits, compulsions and addictions. We could call it the OCD session (obsessive \/ compulsive disease). If we dig deep enough into these issues, we'll always find that they're sourced in fear, and that underneath the fear there is a wealth of buried spiritual treasure - insights, wisdom, talents, creativity, love and joy.<br\/><i>Please be informed that this is the last session we'll do at the old rate of $20. We set that fee 7 yrs. ago and since then both Carol and I have spent thousands of dollars on higher trainings and have become much more adept and accomplished as healers, not to mention that the cost of living has risen substantially. So after this session, the in person fee will be $25 and the distant fee will be $22. This new fees will help cover the processing fee for PayPal payments and the cost of renting Madison Wellness Center for the event, as well as putting a few extra dollars in our pockets. I'll think you'll agree that that's not too much to ask considering what you're getting for your money!<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>In the 7 yrs that we've been doing these sessions, they've become my most popular event, averaging 25 - 35 people. You can come in person or sign up for the distant healing list (you can put your pets on the distant healing list for free). I've kept the cost of low ($20) because I'm committed to providing low cost high quality holistic services which the average working person can take advantage of regularly if they wish. There's some testimonials below, and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.deerspiritreiki.com\/testimonials.html\"> many more on my website<\/a>. If you are coming in person please arrive at Madison Wellness by 7pm (THE DOOR WILL BE LOCKED AT 7:30PM) and pay when you arrive in cash or credit \/ debit card (don't use Paypal if you're coming in person - they take out a fee). If you are on the distant list, the energy will run from 7:45pm - 8:45pm EST. There is no conference call or video feed for the distant session, simple lie or sit down in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed from 7:45pm - 8:45pm.

Thanks to both of you for providing these sessions!\" KC - (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"I have gotten 3 distant group VortexHealing\u00ae sessions and I just wanted to say it is incredible how powerful it feels each time. Even the times I wasn't able to to fully concentrate and enjoy the experience, I felt such a sense of joy and upliftment wash over me when I was doing tasks and I knew this was real what I was experiencing. I suffer from depression and each session makes me feel like a child at my healthiest and happiest state, or as if I am on a very high dose of anti - depressants without the terrible side effects. It means so much to me and I just want to thank you so much - you truly have a gift!\" SB (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"The session was fabulous, afterward I felt light as a feather.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

Even though it is in Queens, it is just only a 20 minute subway ride from midtown. For those that have never been to Queens, this part is incredibly safe (only mentioning this because some people have asked this question in the past)- just as safe as Manhattan. The restaurant is also very close to the subway.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_443079189.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nGold medalist chef Tenzing Tsering has opened second Tibetan Restaurant in New York.

I do notice the people who RSVP and then cancel which really isn't fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean or anything but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Also even if the meetup is full please do put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. I will also try to give an idea in advance if it looks like there might be more spots. Also, if there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to succeed. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

It's a great way to introduce friends to the concept of OM and the community itself since there will be lots of people there with years of experience in the practice. OMing will not take place AT the event but for those trained in the art there will be a circle beforehand at the usual time. The event is free! The door will open at 7:30 sharp and we will go until about 9:30. You're welcome to come anytime in between, unlike our other events which have tighter time tables.

Goods are imported and produced. Waste must be managed. Cities are becoming more sustainable, but can we go beyond that? Instead of just reducing our footprint, is it possible to create regenerative cities that still meet our human needs? Can our problems actually become solutions? The Urban Permaculture Conference (UPC) will kickstart a dialogue and strengthen alliances among key players in the urban sustainability movement. It will bring together urban professionals, researchers, and permaculture designers to expand their interdisciplinary toolboxes. The UPC will showcase the connections between permaculture design, green architecture, engineering, science, city planning, and sustainability education. We will lay the foundation for a safer and greener tomorrow because each field contributes to the greater whole. Permaculture is a design philosophy that emphasizes integration and whole-systems methodology. Permaculture can create a model for urban revitalization through a city infrastructure that\u2019s both functional and beautiful, but it can also empower citizens socially and economically---not just through the city landscape. Permaculture can enhance community diversity, promote food and water security, and strengthen local economies. Beyond Organic Design (BOD) is hosting the UPC in partnership with the City College of New York (CCNY). The UPC features speakers who are experts in permaculture, architecture, engineering, parks, and city planning. This cutting-edge event will be dynamic and interactive with exciting workshops, panels, and group discussions. But it\u2019s not just all talk. There will be community tours, good food and drink, a screening of the new permaculture movie INHABIT, live music, and much more. The UPC will demonstrate possibilities for creating a regenerative urban model that benefits city dwellers around the world.

It is driven by creativity, sustainability and environmental responsibility. We are beginning to build materials using living systems. And in these workshop participants will have the opportunity to learn about one of the most exciting emerging areas in this field - that of bacterial inks and dyes! Internationally renowned leaders in this space, Pili Bio's Thomas Landrain and Natsai Audrey Chieza, will each lead a workshop at Genspace. The first, introducing participants to the science behind the production of bacterial inks and the second, exploring how bacterial dyes could be used for future textile applications. These workshops have been specifically developed to work in parallel with the Biofabricate 2015 summit, allowing some of the ideas of the summit to translate into hands-on experiences. It is the aim that by engaging with these new materials and processes further exciting conversations and possibilities will emerge.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Nevins Street station on the 2,3,4 or 5 train.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Biohackers\/events\/226159427\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Biopigments Workshops","id":"226159427","time":1445612400000,"updated":1445624270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369658080000,"name":"Brooklyn Biohackers","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":8659672,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Biohackers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Biohackers, Geeks, DIYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"11th Ave","name":"Jacob Javits Convention Center ","lon":-74.002002,"id":768969,"state":"NY","lat":40.755783,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.745909690857,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445441172000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I will be speaking at the Unique Photo booth on the topic, \"Working With Inexperienced Models\" on Friday and Saturday of this week at the Photo Plus Expo at Javits Convention Center. \u00a0I will have a live model present and I will be demonstrating some lighting setups and posing techniques \u00a0with her. \u00a0I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Presentation: Working With Inexperienced Models<\/p> <p>Day and Time: Friday at 11:30am and Saturday at 12:30am<\/p> <p>Location: Unique Photo Booth (#850), Javits Convention Center, Photo Plus Expo<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI'll also be announcing a new meet up, at this event. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJohn Ricard<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Portrait-Photography-Seminars-and-Meetups\/events\/226210353\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"\"Working With Inexperienced Models\" presentation","id":"226210353","time":1445614200000,"updated":1445626676000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390247362000,"name":"NYC Portrait Photography Seminars and Meetups","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":12309762,"urlname":"NYC-Portrait-Photography-Seminars-and-Meetups","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"155 W. 72nd Street, #601","name":"Zenyasa Yoga & Wellness Studio","lon":-73.980469,"id":24097271,"state":"NY","lat":40.778435,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.03102874756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444853920000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Gentle Beginnings\/Open Level Yoga with Kelly.

Visitors begin walking a haunted trail, stumbling upon scary scenes of a town driven mad by the Headless Horseman. The Hollow\u2019s unfortunate inhabitants are all too ready to keep visitors from ever leaving. Creatures, human and otherwise, lurk in the shadows, ready to terrify the unsuspecting while incredible special effects disorient and unsettle. Elaborate costumes and the work of award-wining feature-film makeup artists make it all too real.<\/p> <p>Those who survive the trail enter the terrifying ruins of Ichabod\u2019s Schoolhouse, where they must endure a twisted maze of horrors too terrible to describe, only to end up in the lair of the Horseman.

Everything about this place is classy &amp; well done, far superior to most of the other bars\/restaurants on Mamaroneck Ave. The wine: Lily's has a wonderful selection of wine on tap, which can be hard to find. Although it is mostly domestic wines, there's good variety &amp; quality. From these, I particularly recommend the A to Z Chardonnay &amp; the Concannon Cabernet Sauvignon. Aside from the wine on tap, there are a few other wines that can be ordered by the glass &amp; then a great selection of wines by the bottle. Here they have a wide selection of quality wines that one would expect from a wine bar. I'm particularly impressed by the variety of Italian wines.<\/p> <p>Aside from wine, there is a great selection of beers and a full bar. During happy hour (Mon-Fri 4-7pm), beer and wine on tap is only $5! \u00a0<\/p> <p>The food: I've tried two of the personal pizza selections at Lily's - pizza fresca &amp; meat stacking pizza.

Their show is built around the astounding songs and music collected by Englishmen Cecil Sharp and Maud Karpeles.

They give readings from Sharp\u2019s diaries describing vividly the hardships and triumphs of song collecting, and show his evocative photographs of the singers and of mountain life.<\/p> <p><br\/>Contribution: $20; members: $18; fulltime students and children under 15: $10.

It is a festival of worship, dance and music celebrated over a period of nine nights. It is celebrated from the first to the ninth date of Ashwin Shukla Paksha of the Hindu Calendar for the worship of the Goddess Durga. This festival commemorates the victory of Goddess Durga over a demon, Mahishasur.<\/p> <p>During Navratri, devotees of Durga fast and pray for health and prosperity. It is an occasion for vibrant festivities. The Garba or Dandiya Raas is the most significant feature during the festival of Navratri. This is the traditional and folk dance of the state of Gujarat, but today, everyone performs this dance with great fervor and enthusiasm. During the dance, a decorated pot is ceremoniously placed with a light inside and the women folk dance in a circle, singing 'traditional songs' or 'garbas'.<\/p> <p>Then there is a pooja on each day of this holy period where Goddess Durga, known in this state as Ambe Maa is worshipped for prosperity and happiness. During all the nine nights, men, women and children flock together in the street and peform Garba-Raas in circumambulation around the statue of devi, accompanied by religious songs eulogizing the Mother-Goddess in tune with instrumental music till late night which has deep socio-religious impact on the Hindu society. A Mandvi of the Goddess is framed by woodcarving in which a small idol of Mother Goddess is placed with a number of ghee lamps. The devotees put this Mandvi on their heads and maintaining balance, perform Garba-dance.<\/p> <p>Gujarat is the cardinal center for the celebration of Navratri Mahotsava, where young men and women wearing traditional attire dance with zeal, joy, jubilation and devotional fervor, till late mid-night. Out of the nine forms of Mother-Goddess, the triumvirate of Mahakali, Maha-Laxmi and Maha-Sarasvati symbolize prowess, affluence and erudition - the most essential things for the prosperity and progress of mankind. the Mother-Goddess grants all these three to the devotees who observe Navratri in right spirit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------------<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet us between 9:00pm and 9:15pm in front of the White Castle at 2995 John F Kennedy Blvd. One of us will be holding a sign that says \"MEETUP\".

Participants are briefly walked through their bodies while sitting quietly. A period of silent follows\u00a0for 20-25 minutes.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoodsprograms to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/226158525\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"226158525","time":1445690700000,"updated":1445959583000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10451","country":"us","city":"Bronx","address_1":"146th Street and St Anns avenue","name":"St Marys Park","lon":-73.914112,"id":965681,"state":"NY","lat":40.812302,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.86782646179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445618012000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NYRR Open Run St. Mary's Park is a series of free weekly run\/walks open to everyone in the community.
