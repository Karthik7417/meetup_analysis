This is for accidental or intentional blur.<\/p> <p>Accidental blur might be the result of camera shake or even an accidental snap. The result may look terrible, but in some instances may create an interesting effect.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Intentional blur might achieve an impressionistic ambience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are many kinds of blur: lens blur, motion blur, panning\/zooming blur, filter blur (Vaseline, hairspray, stockings, cling wrap, etc.), each lending its own look and characteristics. \u00a0You can also create blur though enhancement software.<\/p> <p>Blur offers many opportunities for producing extraordinary images and which blur to use will depend on your own preferences. Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons, consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate.<\/p> <p>For example, blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look at the subject matter, lighting, colors, shapes, and textures, and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image. Blur can be an effective way of achieving this.<\/p> <p>Note the winner of the December contest will judge the February Contest instead of January's which will be judged by member's votes.

Today KAULDER is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Contact MONDO ITALIANO at [masked]\/Tel:[masked]<\/p> <p>The documentary and the Capodarco project will be presented by Film Director Luca Guardabascio.<\/p> <p>Father Franco Monterubbianesi is the Founder of the Capodarco Community, a non-profit organization working since 1966 to promote and defend the dignity of marginalized people, especially those wtih mental and physical disability. The organization promotes their social and employment integration.<br\/>Since 1966 when he was a young priest, Father Franco was inspired by a strong belief that he made his only one mission: we should not accept injustice. In a globalized world based on economic power and competitiveness, marginalized people are victims of social and cultural exclusion. Father Franco, now 83 years old, has spent all his life promoting the affirmation of human, social and cultural rights of people with disabilities.<br\/>Today the young generations are the new marginalized people. Capodarco has deeply marked the Italian Welfare State promoting important National Legislation such as on school integration of disabled students or in more recent years on social agriculture. The Italian Law knows as Legge Basaglia that abolished Mental Hospitals was also inspired by the Capodarco example.<br\/>\"Capodarco: prima del futuro\" (Capodarco: Before the Future) is a documentary about the Capodarco Project. Directed by Luca Guardabascio, the film involves Capodarco residents and their realities which represent the main aspect of Capodarco's ideas not only of the past and of the present, but also of the future.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/1\/f\/600_443544095.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers\/events\/226347607\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Screening of \"Capodarco e i giovani\" Before the Future\" (by Luca Guardabascio)","id":"226347607","time":1446681600000,"updated":1446693952000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1047114201000,"name":"MONDO ITALIANO: Pittsburgh Italian Meetup","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":85432,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Italian Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"122 Meyran Ave","name":"NoWait","lon":-79.95848,"id":23802821,"state":"PA","lat":40.440636,"repinned":true},"headcount":28,"distance":2.07473039627,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438850437000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The real world is messy \u2013 in fact, it's hazardous. \u00a0We build hulking fortresses around our code to protect our apps from the real world. \u00a0However, the tools we use \u2013 the languages and third-party libs \u2013 often conceal lurking hazards, too. \u00a0Loosely typed APIs allow developers to make common mistakes that will blow up at run-time.

Biophilia argues that we have co-evolved with nature and that we have a deep need to affiliate with the natural world. \u00a0But how can that connection to nature happen in in an increasingly urbanized world? And what are the other ways that cities can co-exist with, nurture and care for nature, both local and global? Timothy Beatley will argue that we need to shift towards a vision of\u00a0biophilic cities\u00a0and will describe some of the things that emerging leaders and partner cities are doing in this arena.<\/p> <p>Timothy Beatley has taught in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning, School of Architecture at the University of Virginia for the last 28 years. He is the author or co-author of more than fifteen books on these subjects, including\u00a0Green Urbanism: Learning from European Cities\u00a0(recently translated into Chinese),\u00a0Native to Nowhere: Sustaining Home and Community in a Global Age, andBiophilic Cities: Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning.

To help Pennsylvanians navigate these complex decisions, 90.5 WESA joins NPR to bring NPR Presents: Family Matters to Pittsburgh for a candid conversation about personal finance at Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum on November 5 at 7:00 PM. Tickets for the free event are available here.<\/p> <p><br\/>David Greene, host of NPR's Morning Edition<br\/>CREDIT DAVID GILKEY<br\/>In collaboration with NPR Member stations, NPR Presents: Family Matters is a live national events series that connects regular people with financial experts for invaluable conversations around money. Led by NPR Morning Edition host David Greene and Business correspondents Yuki Noguchi and Sonari Glinton, these live (and lively) events are driven by an audience ready to talk strategy: from accumulating debt and amassing wealth; to saving for college, home ownership, retirement and even fitting in a midlife extravagance, or two.<\/p> <p>In Pittsburgh, Greene and Noguchi will be joined on stage by personal finance experts Louis Barajas, founder and chief wealth and business manager at LAB Financial Life Solutions, and Saundra Davis, a U.S. Navy Veteran and financial coach who works alongside community-based organizations that empower low income Americans with tools to build and grow assets. Together they will leave audience members with greater confidence in their financial futures.<\/p> <p>The public can follow and participate in these conversations with #NPRFamilyMatters.<\/p> <p><br\/>NPR Business Reporter Yuki Noguchi<br\/>Through reporting projects that have taken them to the living rooms, banks and offices where people are making big decisions about money, Greene and Noguchi each have unique perspectives on the specific pressures families face today. Greene has been hosting Family Matters events in communities across the country since 2013. In the Morning Edition series \u2018Family Matters: The Money Squeeze\u2019, he joined three families to explore the financial challenges of the \"sandwich generation\u201d \u2013 those balancing elder-care costs, college-bound kids and post-employment retirement plans. Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues \u2013 from abusive working environments, to idiosyncratic cubicle culture \u2013 and national stories that strongly affect working Americans, such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes. NPR Presents: Family Matters is made possible by TIAA-CREF, which \u2014for nearly 100 years\u2014has helped millions of Americans pursue their financial dreams, and by a collaboration between NPR and NPR Member station 90.5 WESA, in Pittsburgh, P.A.<\/p> <p>ABOUT NPR<\/p> <p>NPR is the leading provider of non-commercial news and entertainment programming in the U.S. More than 27 million people listen to NPR programs each week via 800+ public radio stations throughout the country. In partnership with Member stations, NPR strives to create a more informed public \u2013 one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures. As a digital innovator and a leader in the public media community, NPR assures that the unique mission of nonprofit public media is not only preserved, but grows.<\/p> <p>About 90.5 WESA<\/p> <p>90.5 WESA, Pittsburgh\u2019s NPR news station, is a local, wholly-owned subsidiary of independent public radio station 91.3 WYEP \/Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corp. 90.5 WESA can be heard on 90.5 FM in Pittsburgh; 92.3 FM in New Baltimore; 100.5 FM in Johnstown, 104.1 FM in Ligonier and Somerset, and online at wesa.fm.<\/p> <p>About The Panelists<\/p> <p>David Greene -- Co-Host, Morning Edition<\/p> <p>@NPRGreene<\/p> <p>David Greene co-hosts NPR\u2019s #1 newsmagazine Morning Edition alongside Renee Montagne and Steve Inskeep. David has interviewed everyone from presidents to pop stars, but he believes that everyone, whether famous or not, has a compelling story to tell \u2013 it just takes listening. David has brought home human interest stories from places like North Dakota, as Americans grapple with the issue of same-sex marriage, and Crimea, where uneasiness around geopolitical unrest and national identity is perennial and complex. Prior to stepping into the host chair, David spent two years abroad as an NPR international correspondent based in Moscow. During the Arab Spring, David spent a month reporting from Libya as NATO bombs fell on Tripoli, for which he was honored with the Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize.<\/p> <p>David also spent four years covering the G.W. Bush administration; a position that led him to five continents, to NPR\u2019s \u201cspacious\u201d booth in the basement of the West Wing and aboard Air Force One, as President Bush first surveyed the devastation from Hurricane Katrina and afterward met with affected New Orleans residents. David reported deeply on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and, after President Obama took office, spent three months driving across America documenting how the recession was affecting the lives of regular Americans.<\/p> <p>David was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun for nearly seven years before he joined NPR in 2005. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a degree in government.<\/p> <p>Yuki Noguchi -- NPR Business Desk Correspondent in Washington, D.C.<\/p> <p>@YukiNoguchi<\/p> <p>As NPR Business correspondent, Yuki Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues \u2013 from abusive working environments, to idiosyncratic cubicle culture \u2013 and national stories that strongly affect working Americans, such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes.<\/p> <p>Following Reddit CEO Ellen Pao\u2019s lawsuit alleging gender discrimination by Pao\u2019s former Silicon Valley employer, Yuki reported on how startups are using tech to fight workplace bias. She\u2019s similarly synthesized other evolving workplace dynamics, such as Zappos\u2019 \u201cholocratic\u201d employee structure, Amazon\u2019s inclusion of peer reviews in staff evaluations and a 2015 federal law requiring public companies to disclose ratios comparing their CEO\u2019s compensation to their workers\u2019 median pay.<\/p> <p>Since joining NPR in 2008, Noguchi has reported deeply on business and economic news and in recent years has covered the housing market meltdown, unemployment during the Great Recession, and the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan. Her coverage interests are wide-ranging, and have included things like entomophagy and the St. Louis Cardinals.<\/p> <p>Yuki began her career in journalism at the Washington Post, where she reported on business and technology and later became an editor.<\/p> <p>Yuki lives with her family in the Washington, D.C. area. She has a degree in history from Yale.<\/p> <p><br\/>Luis Barajas<br\/>Louis Barajas defies the traditional concept of financial and business expert. Louis connects with people through their hearts, their dreams, and the often-difficult realities of their lives. He\u2019s not just about numbers. Rather than fixating on the size of the client\u2019s bank balance, investment portfolio, or retirement account, his approach has always been to show people how to use their resources to live better lives today, tomorrow, and in the future. His humanity-based financial and business advice works well for people making $25,000, $250,000, or Millions, because most everyone has a deep desire to want to make a difference in their lives.<\/p> <p>Louis is the author of 5 books: Small Business Big Life for Women \u2013 7 Secrets for Designing A Business to Help You Live Your Best Life; My Street Money \u2013 A Street-Level View of Managing Your Money From the Heart to the Bank; The Latino Journey to Financial Greatness \u2013 10 Steps to Creating Wealth and Happiness for You and Your Family; Small Business \u2013 Big Life; and Overworked Overwhelmed and Underpaid.<\/p> <p>Louis is one of the first Latinos in the United States to receive the Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae) designation. He was named as one of the Top 100 Financial Advisors by Mutual Funds Magazine. Money Magazine also named Louis as one of America\u2019s Top Advisors. He was also chosen by People en Espa\u00f1ol as a person making a difference in the lives of Americans.<\/p> <p>Louis has been featured in regional and national publications such as USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, People en Espa\u00f1ol, Hispanic Business, and Senior Market Advisor. He has provided his financial and business insights to national news programs such as CBS Sunday Morning, CNN\u2019s Your Money, CNBC, The Willis Report on Fox Business News, Aqui Y Ahora on Univision, ABC News, and National Public Radio\u2019s Tell Me More.<\/p> <p><br\/>Saundra Davis<br\/>Saundra Davis is a US Navy veteran, financial coach, educator, and consultant who is nationally recognized as an expert in the financial coaching field and for her work with community-based organizations that focus on asset building for the working poor. Ms. Davis is the founder and Executive Director of Sage Financial Solutions, a San Francisco-based organization that develops comprehensive financial capability programs for low- and moderate-income communities in California and throughout the United States. Her innovative approach to financial capability was recognized in 2008 when she was selected as an Echoing Green semifinalist and, most recently, via special invitation to attend President Obama\u2019s 2014 White House Summit5o Working Families.<\/p> <p>Ms. Davis holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Management and a Master\u2019s degree in Financial Planning from Golden Gate University where she is currently an adjunct professor in the Personal Financial Planning program. She has previously served as an adjunct professor and as a member of the Financial Planning Program Advisory Committee at the University of California Berkeley.<\/p> <p>TAGS:<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/226417029\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"NPR\/TIaacrfe present: Family Matters: Saving for college, home,  and retirement","id":"226417029","time":1446768000000,"updated":1446780540000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"2312 Main Street - REAR ENTRANCE","name":"La Dorita ","lon":0,"id":23595691,"state":"PA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.95771121979,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442059501000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i>Tickets $15 online at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.omapittsburgh.org\/\">www.omapittsburgh.org<\/a>\u00a0or $20 at the door.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Doors open at 6:15pm.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nReady to transform your life?\u00a0 Join Reiki master, medium and psychotherapist Bonnie Hassan as she offers you the opportunity to let go of the past and step into your future in a bigger way!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Bonnie uses Reiki (a Japanese relaxation technique) and the synergy of the group energy, as she channels Native American spirits that speak to your soul in a language only your soul understands.

Everyone in the school community is invited to join together in reading and discussing:<\/p> <p>Dreamland: The True Tale of America\u2019s Opiate Epidemic by Sam Quinones.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE BOOK<\/p> <p>In fascinating detail, Sam Quinones chronicles how, over the past 15 years, enterprising sugar cane farmers in a small county on the west coast of Mexico created a unique distribution system that brought black tar heroin--the cheapest, most addictive form of the opiate, 2 to 3 times purer than its white powder cousin--to the veins of people across the United States. Communities where heroin had never been seen before--from Charlotte, NC and Huntington, WVA, to Salt Lake City and Portland, OR--were overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin, long considered a drug found only in the dense, urban environments along the East Coast, and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels, be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here, and perhaps more importantly, why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered?<\/p> <p>With the same dramatic drive of El Narco and Methland, Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico, independent of the drug cartels, in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to America's rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford, Connecticut, determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug, Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin, American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents, local, small-town sheriffs, and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department, ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service.<\/p> <p>Dreamland is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.<br\/>{excerpt from book synopsis from Amazon.com}<\/p> <p>WHERE TO GET THE BOOK<\/p> <p>Books can be purchased at a 10% discount at the University Bookstore on Fifth, by showing your Pitt ID The book is also available from Pitt's Hillman Library and from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh both as a traditional book and as an e-book download for Kindle, Overdrive, and EPUB format.<\/p> <p>EVENTS<\/p> <p>Thursday, October 29, 4-5 p.m., A115 Crabtree Hall<br\/>The Heroin and Opioid Overdose Epidemic in Pennsylvania by Dean Donald Burke<br\/>(GR approved event)<\/p> <p>Tuesday, November 10, 3:30 p.m., University Club - Ballroom A<br\/>One Book, One Community Author Visit By Dreamland Author Sam Quinones<br\/>Reception immediately following.<br\/>(GR approved event)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Non Hosted Event, Look for OTHERS whose PICTURES are RSVP'd here!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/226508968\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Pitt Health Lecture: Author of Dreamland Sam Quinones","id":"226508968","time":1447185600000,"updated":1447198038000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15216","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412 657-0030","address_1":"2120 Broadway Ave","name":"Sparkledragon's Magical Emporium","lon":-80.03021,"id":22446562,"state":"PA","lat":40.40442,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.20336961746,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442949226000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be at Sparkledragon's Magical Emporium every other Tuesday. \u00a0We are offering $5 henna designs. \u00a0I will also be offering readings for donation. \u00a0I read Shadowscapes tarot and can offer other forms of divination as well. \u00a0Walk-ins welcome. \u00a0We will have a sign-up sheet on site. \u00a0If there is a wait when you arrive you can browse the shop, go grab a bite to eat at one of several near-by places, or enjoy a cup of tea!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"T-stop","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/226414576\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":18000000,"name":"Henna and Readings with Blue Fenix","id":"wnmxklytpbnb","time":1447189200000,"updated":1447208054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15212","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"30 Isabella St # 202","name":"Microsoft Corporation","lon":-80.003136,"id":8708152,"state":"PA","lat":40.448093,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.18378543854,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445825361000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meeting Sponsor<br\/>-------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to Oxford Solutions for sponsoring November's meeting.

Being a message-based approach, the actor model fits nicely when building out transactional or multi-step workflow process systems. Message-driven actor systems take a lot of the complexity away and allow you to create small classes (actors) that handle very specific tasks. These actors are coordinated via the passing of immutable messages, which allows your system to scale out if needed. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at a popular .NET actor system Akka.NET and, through several simple examples, show you how to get started building scalable message-driven solutions.<\/p> <p>David Hoerster, a 5-time C# MVP, is a recovering corporate financial analyst and has been working with the Microsoft.NET Framework since the early 1.0 betas.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Basically, I gave this workshop at an event this past weekend, and it went so well we decided to squeeze another one in here in Pittsburgh this year.<\/p> <p>The event combines Jungaian psychology and shamanic work. We will open with sacred space, setting a focus point for our work, then proceed to discussing what shadow work is, why and how a person can do it and what it's history is. We will also discuss what the personality is and how doing shadow work can transform it. The discussion parts will be relatively brief as we will be focusing on the next part, which includes four shamanic journeys into the different mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies to actually meet the shadow aspects of our nature and start the transformation process.<\/p> <p>You will be given the techniques, resources, and even a sample of grounding essential oils to take home so you can continue this work on your own.<\/p> <p>Folding chairs provided, but if you'd like something more comfortable to sit or lay on, you are welcome to bring it.<\/p> <p>More details can be found at the event page: <a href=\"http:\/\/rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.us9.list-manage1.com\/track\/click?u=80aac8834de6dc6fc7ce25a3d&amp;id=5bfbb4db34&amp;e=9c08263c73\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/rebekahgambleholisticpractitioner.us9.list-manage1.com\/track\/click?u=80aac8834de6dc6fc7ce25a3d&amp;id=5bfbb4db34&amp;e=9c08263c73<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/226475634\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":5400000,"name":"Shadow Work and Transforming Personality","id":"226475634","time":1447459200000,"updated":1447472076000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1035 S Braddock Ave","name":"Regent Square Theater","lon":-79.894615,"id":19873162,"lat":40.433617,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.85460424423,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446613372000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Part 5<br\/>THESE DAUGHTERS OF MINE (Moje c\u00f3rki krowy) 2015 Director Kinga D\u0119bska<br\/><b>Fri.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists).

Namely\u00a0Joshua Milton Blahyi or as he is known by another name. I didn't know anything about him, but the discussion caused me to do some research, and its a very fascinating case which would be interesting to discuss.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This particular General killed many people during the Liberian civil war in the most horrific and brutal ways you can image in your nightmares. And then, he claims he met Jesus, repented, and is now preaching the gospel all over Liberia, as a free man.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This brings up an interesting discussion. Something which skeptics often claim as a reason they cannot believe in Jesus. \"How can someone like Hitler, repent at the end of his life and go to heaven, even though he murdered millions of people?\" Is this fair? Is this justice?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Well here is an example where something similar actually happened.

is a class that will prepare curious and interested people for the monthly journeying meetup group. This is the perfect class for people who are new to journeying and want to see if it's for them or to prepare a participant for future journeying work.<\/p> <p>I will open the class with a brief history and cultural lesson and brief introduction to journey work and shamanic work. You'll get an idea of where this practice comes from, how it's come to be what it is in modern usage in America and the sorts of journeys that many people use. We'll go over the journeys that we will be doing at the event, which include:<\/p> <p>1. Journeying to meet a power animal or helper. You will need this for all of your journey work from here on out.<\/p> <p>2. Journeying for shadow work (also called inner child work or integrative psychology work). This is a chance to meet the darker nature of the self and how this came to be, to see what you need to work on healing and integrating.<\/p> <p>3. Journeying to upper world for guidance.<\/p> <p>After the introduction, we will get to the journeys. I will use different tools for each journey so you can get an idea of what these feel like. After each journey, there will be some quiet time to write down your experience, and then we will have the opportunity to share our experiences if you would like.<\/p> <p>We will also cover some of the pitfalls of journeying and some of it's dangers and how to avoid these.<\/p> <p>You will need to bring a notebook or something to write on and writing materials so that you can document your experiences for later reference. I will provide water, tea and coffee in the lobby, but snacks you are welcome to bring. There is also a middle eastern restaurant across the street that is pretty amazing if you want to catch lunch afterwards. There are chairs and a few couches in the office space, and one person is also welcome to use the massage table (if you can manage not to go to sleep on it!), but if you have special needs you may want to bring something to ensure you're accommodated properly.<\/p> <p>The event is $30 pre-registered (send payments to [masked] through pay pal) or $35 at the door. We have limited space for these events, so I do encourage you to pre-register.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you who are curious as to my qualifications and background in shamanic work, here they are:<\/p> <p>-Training in six traditions both from traditional indigenous people and from modern PhDs. The traditional teachings were done in more of an apprenticeship type work rather than in a classroom, and this training has happened in four countries.<\/p> <p>-All the markers of a shamanic path in childhood, as well as the experiences that went with it.<\/p> <p>-Education in this type of work at three universities and an academy run by practitioners.<\/p> <p>-Active membership at the Society for Shamanic Practitioners.<\/p> <p>I'm also qualified in transpersonal psychology, which I studied at two universities and one practitioner-run academy. I am currently working towards a PhD and am considering starting a new apprenticeship in medicine work next year.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/226492771\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Journeying 101 Workshop","id":"226492771","time":1447610400000,"updated":1447631366000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue","name":"Squirrel Hill Carnegie Library, Room B","lon":-79.92263,"id":24166969,"state":"PA","lat":40.438454,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.61701893806,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445542343000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Mark your calendars for our next meeting on Sunday, November 15th at the Squirrel Hill Library, Room B, from 1-3 PM.<\/p> <p>We've been reading The Lymond Chronicles together and following Francis Crawford of Lymond to Scotland, France, Malta, Constantinople, Moscow (and back again). <b>We're wrapping up this group-read with a no-spoilers-barred review of the entire series! <\/b>If you haven't wanted to be part of a book-by-book reread but are yearning to talk about this series, now's your chance to discuss the characters you love (and love to hate) and agonize over those confounding plot twists.<\/p> <p>After this meeting we'll take a little break until 2016, when we'll gather again to begin reading The House of Niccolo together.

Following formal remarks, the Korean Heritage Classroom Committee\u2014a group of local Korean-American citizens who oversaw the classroom\u2019s funding efforts\u2014will present a specially made ceremonial key to Nordenberg. The key presentation symbolizes the committee gifting the classroom to the University of Pittsburgh.<\/p> <p>The cultural festival will feature performances by Korean-American talent as well as entertainers from abroad. Notable performers will include the Maryland-based Korean Performing Arts Academy of America, the Korean Pittsburgh Women\u2019s Chorus, the Young Brothers Tae Kwon Do Academy, and the internationally acclaimed Korean Children\u2019s Choir from South Korea. Authentic Korean food and crafts will be available, and Pitt\u2019s Quo Vadis Guides\u2014Nationality Room student tour guides with extensive knowledge of each room\u2014will offer tours of the Korean Heritage Classroom to attendees.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Korean Heritage Classroom stands as a tribute to the culture and history of what are now North and South Korea,\u201d said Bruhns, who has overseen the construction of 11 Nationality Rooms since becoming director in June 1965. \u201cFor nearly 90 years, the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Nationality and Heritage Classrooms have recognized the diverse group cultures that came together to make Pittsburgh and the United States of America great places to live, learn, and work. We welcome our latest addition, celebrating both their history and our future together.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Korean Heritage Classroom\u2019s design keeps with Pitt\u2019s longstanding requirement that all Nationality Rooms represent a time period prior to 1787, the year of Finely carved woodwork crafted by artisans who specialize in traditional Korean architecture.<br\/>Finely carved woodwork crafted by artisans who specialize in traditional Korean architecture.<br\/>the University\u2019s founding and the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The design concept was inspired by the \u201cMyeongnyundang,\u201d\u2014translated as \u201cHall of Enlightenment\u201d\u2014the main lecture hall of South Korea\u2019s Sungkyunkwan University. Founded in 1398, Sungkyunkwan served as Korea\u2019s \u201croyal academy\u201d and was the region\u2019s foremost institution of higher education for nearly two centuries. Today, the lecture hall continues to be used for special ceremonial events and is recognized throughout Asia as a prominent historical monument.<\/p> <p>Like the Hall of Enlightenment, the Korean Heritage Classroom depicts three connected rooms, with two oak columns forming a symbolic boundary. The center room is longer with a lofty ceiling. Sungkyunkwan officials used the center room for ceremonies, lectures, rituals, and other important public events. The two smaller adjoining rooms were used for faculty research and private meetings.<\/p> <p>The ceiling of the central room is adorned with a pair of wooden phoenixes, inspired by the royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. All windows are covered with a specially produced paper product made of mulberry tree fibers. Desks are made of hard oak and have seating for groups of two or three students. There are two doors: a front door that leads to the Cathedral of Learning\u2019s third-floor corridor and a symbolic back door, for aesthetic purposes, that faces Heinz Memorial Chapel. In the Hall of Enlightenment, the back door would have led to the Sungkyunkwan\u2019s courtyard.<\/p> <p>The Korean Heritage Classroom will be the first of Pitt\u2019s Nationality Rooms to be equipped with state-of-the-art technology. Devices include an 85-inch Samsung 3D monitor along with Wi-Fi connection and four centrally placed speakers. Such technology will be standard in the construction of future Nationality and Heritage Classrooms.<\/p> <p>The Korean Heritage Classroom\u2019s dedication is the culmination of more than eight years of work by Pitt administrators, citizens, donors, government officials, and Classroom Wall Decoration<br\/>Classroom Wall Decoration<br\/>supporters in both the United States and South Korea. Following official approval by then-Chancellor Nordenberg in the fall of 2007, a seven-year international fundraising campaign raised more than $850,000 in donations.<\/p> <p>The classroom\u2019s building materials were procured and crafted in various regions of South Korea and shipped to Pittsburgh during the spring of 2015. Throughout the summer, Korean artisans and craftsmen\u2014who specialize in traditional Korean architecture\u2014assembled the materials within room 304 of the Cathedral of Learning. Construction continued throughout the fall semester and was completed in late October.<\/p> <p>Established in 1926 by then-Chancellor John Bowman, Pitt\u2019s Nationality Rooms are representative of\u2014and pay tribute to\u2014the cultural groups that settled Allegheny County. The classrooms are located on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning and are used as functioning classrooms. Pitt\u2019s Nationality Rooms are maintained and supported through a partnership between the local populations of these cultural groups and the University of Pittsburgh.<\/p> <p>###<\/p>

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.

This change applies for the next few weeks.\u00a0 There is also a library that is open until 8 pm if you forget. The point is -- don't show up at 7:00 because there is not much else to do there while waiting except work out (you may or may not have to pay extra to that -- I don't know) or go to the library.\u00a0 I found out about this schedule change the hard way last week.<\/p> <p><br\/>Given this scheduling change, I would really appreciate some suggestions for alternate facilities to beg, borrow, or rent and some days of the week and times that might work for other people.\u00a0 An ideal facility has badminton court markings, nets and support posts to use, high ceilings, diffuse, fairly bright light without any direct sunshine, shower facilities, and drinking water. Vending machines or nearby places to get a bite to eat would be an added plus for those players who would prefer to arrive straight from work.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hampton's facility offers informal play in a clean, well-lit, facility with a ceiling suitable for executing high clear shots.\u00a0 Separate men's and women's showers and changing areas are available in the bathrooms.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The court surface is made of concrete and the official boundaries of each of six courts are clearly marked.\u00a0 On Tuesdays, we are allotted three badminton courts.\u00a0 Hampton Community Center allows us to set up a fourth court if warranted. There needs to be a sufficient number of badminton players and few enough basketball players, cheerleaders and martial artists that they have adequate remaining space.<\/p> <p>Admission is 5$ which must be paid at the front desk. This helps pay for the \"real\" (goose-feather) shuttlecocks.<\/p> <p>If you prefer to play the significantly more durable and consistent nylon shuttlecocks, I, for one, will be willing to play them with you.

After we eat and talk a little, each person will present their work to the group for discussion. We will keep all comments constructive and fair.

In doing so, Williams not only challenged the Klan-dominated establishment of his hometown of Monroe, North Carolina, he alienated the mainstream Civil Rights Movement, which advocated peaceful resistance.<\/p> <p>Robert F. Williams was the forefather of the Black Power movement and broke dramatic new ground by internationalizing the African American struggle. Negroes with Guns is not only an electrifying look at an historically erased leader, but also provides a thought-provoking examination of Black radicalism and resistance and serves as a launching pad for the study of Black liberation philosophies.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Insightful interviews with historian Clayborne Carson, biographer Timothy Tyson, Julian Bond, and a first person account by Mabel Williams, Robert's wife, bring the story to life.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/a\/b\/600_443271883.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/226125804\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":9000000,"name":"NEGROES WITH GUNS SCREENS AT THE SEMBENE FILM FESTIVAL 11\/19","id":"226125804","time":1447974000000,"updated":1447983891000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15131","country":"us","city":"White Oak","address_1":"3017 Jacks Run Road","name":"Christina's Restaurant","lon":-79.792244,"id":16800842,"state":"PA","lat":40.347141,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.8960390091,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447255249000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Hello there my fellow real estate investor!<\/b><\/p> <p>We are all set for our FREE November real estate investor Meetup!

Regardless of what we\u2019re designing--a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.<\/p> <p>This class is for anyone who makes (or wants to learn how to make) websites, mobile apps, or other software. If you\u2019re a developer, a designer, a project manager, a content creator, or something else, you can integrate UX research and design into your practice.<\/p> <p>By the end of this class, you\u2019ll also learn tips and techniques to address the following:<\/p> <p>\u00a0- The fundamentals of UX and why UX matters.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Conducting user research so you can understand your audiences\u2019 needs and make design decisions to address those needs.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Basic usability testing techniques.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Convincing skeptics you work with of the value of user experience.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Engaging your clients and colleagues in the UX process so that they can bring their knowledge to the table and feel that their needs have been met.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Working UX into your existing process, even if it\u2019s one small step at a time, and even if you have little to no budget, time, or support.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Participating in and learning an interactive brainstorming workshop we\u2019ll do as a class. We\u2019ll discuss the results and talk about ways that you can use the workshop at your current organization to collectively tackle UX issues.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- Recommendations for books, articles, and other resources to explore further areas of UX.<\/p> <p><b><i>If you are interested in attending, but cannot afford the class, please fill out our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/11Njjlr5eokX7HCyQTqlJWOX92ZPFcEmCnEjCED3fBHk\/viewform\">scholarship application<\/a>.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>TEACHER BIOGRAPHY<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Kate Holloway is a User Experience\/Mobile User Interface Designer at NoWait in Pittsburgh, where she currently lives with her husband and two cats.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Talking Stick Therapies is a therepeutic drum circle program that combines tribal practices with western counseling methods and drum circles. We have a talking stick, and we share our feelings, experiences and thoughts about a chosen topic for that month. When a person has an emotional release, they are supported and given more energy though the joy of the drums. We also drum just for fun! This is a place for healing, joy, and growth.<\/p> <p>This month our topic is releasing and transcending judgement. We'll open with a brief meditation, then alternate between drumming and discussion based on materials provided at the circle. We wil have plenty of drums, though you're welcome to bring one if you have it and want to. We also provide fold up chairs, but if this doesn't suit your physical needs you may wish to bring a cushion or like modifier.<\/p> <p>This circle is about you and what you need. Do you need to express yourself on the drum? Do you need to speak? Do you need to be supported but would rather do so without speaking? Are you looking for a loving, accepting community? Do you want energy work? Do you want to hear other people express the same struggles you have so you don\u2019t feel alone? This is the place for you to do what you need to do. This is a safe place to open up, say the things you normally suppress, and be supported. You have two practitioners right there to support you if you need us.<\/p> <p>We've changed the cost of the circle. By eliminating the discounts we offered, we are now able to provide the circle to all people for $10 each if they pre-pay or $15 at the door. You may pre-pay by sending your payment through paypal to [masked]. This helps pay for the travel for Stephanie to come from Virginia and co-facilitate, and it helps us keep the lights on at the office space.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/226493322\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Therepeutic Drum Circle","id":"226493322","time":1448751600000,"updated":1448764383000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15211","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"319 West Sycamore Street","name":"Grace Episcopal Church","lon":-80.011368,"id":3128631,"state":"PA","lat":40.432426,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.15019273758,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443659428000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is one of our weekly sessions.

It's not so much that we want you to get stuffed with the worst worst, but rather pick a sampling of your best worst reads. It's a good time to snack before the meal on some truly trashy stuff... some pulp science fiction or detective, a decadent romance novel or a lesser work by a well-known author, then more pie for you. However, if you want to stay with the classics or a short stories collection, so be it. Or, if you want to celebrate the holidays with a nod to your heritage or family or food. Fine.
