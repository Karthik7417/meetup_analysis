All nationalities are welcome.\n\nWhat can you expect? Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 30-40 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Baby Sign Language lets babies, as young as six months old communicate their needs so they don't need to cry as often. Your baby will learn how to tell you when she is hungry, wants more, or is all done; if he is too cold or too hot, or if she just needs a hug. Studies reveal that babies who sign begin speaking earlier and have a larger vocabulary than their non-signing peers. I started this group because I wanted to empower my baby girl to express herself through signing and because I could find no classes in our local area. Packing baby up to take her into the City or into Bergen County was not something that I wanted to do on a regular basis.

Our goal is to provide a space for professional women from a diverse range of disciplines can relax unwind and network with peers in a collaborative and rewarding environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>While the group is mainly geared towards women, we aren't in this alone; men make up the other half of the equation and as such, men who support women's empowerment are critical allies and are welcome to bring a fresh perspective from a male p.o.v. to the group. A sample of the important areas of focus for the group include the following: <br><\/p>\n<p>Business Ideas and Strategies to Maximize Success. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you've got it all figured out and want to share, or are struggling along, this group formulates ideas and strategies to move you to the next level your career. <br><\/p>\n<p>Interpersonal Relationships and Communication <br><\/p>\n<p>Balancing work and relationships is a challenge every successful business woman must master. Here women share their experiences and strategies for having a rewarding personal life outside of the boardroom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Women's Leadership and Political Representation <br><\/p>\n<p>Representation in the business and political worlds is key to the successful integration of women into the decision-making fabric of our society.

What now? This group effectively explores and provides solutions to effectively manage our maternal instincts, with work life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Overcoming Fear of Failure <br><\/p>\n<p>\"Courage allows the successful woman to fail and learn powerful lessons, from the failure. So that in the end, she didn't fail at all.\" -Maya Angelou<\/p>\n<p> Studies show [1], a major inhibitor of success among women, much more so than men, is fear of failure. But why fear failure, when you can mine it for gems that will help you to become even more successful than you would have been without this bump in the road? This group examines the rules of engagement when facing failures. We discuss these teaching moments as phenomenal launching pads to coming back stronger and more successful than ever. <br><\/p>\n<p>Beyond our member-driven seminars and workshops, we also take time to bond and enjoy the wider world. Whether dressing up and having a night on the town or planning an adventurous excursion, anything can happen when women put their minds to it. Come join us and make friendships which will last a lifetime. <br><\/p>\n<p>[1] Clifford, Catherine. \"Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.\" Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.

Not only is it an important source of carbohydrates, it\u2019s also portable and compact, which helps to explain why it has been an integral part of our diet for thousands of years. In fact, recent scholarship suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 years ago. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Nutritional significance<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nutritionally, bread is known as an ample source for the grains category of nutrition. Serving size of bread is standard through ounces, counting one slice of bread (white processed bread) as 1 oz. Also, bread is considered a good source of carbohydrates through the whole grains, nutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber.

When the yogi and dancer in us meet the interplay of their energies gives birth to a theater fueled not by their search for stardom, but by their quest for the betterment of humanity. The ultimate purpose of this yoga class is to prepare practitioners to develop a discipline and daily yoga practice in order to exercise introspection, build self-awareness and ultimately achieve growth. \"Knowing love, I will allow all things to come and go, to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage. Life is right in any case. My heart is as open as the sky.\" About Sylvie Bayeux Being a multifaceted woman Sylvie sees her self foremost as an Educator. She has been a religious yoga practitioner throughout her entire artistic career in theater and dance, developing her own personal practice based on Iyenger, Ashtanga and Multiversal schools of yoga. Teaching yoga to dancers, athletes and neophytes she helps them achieve strength, flexibility, and balance. Yet most importantly she guides them through a life-transforming experience, that of freeing their power within. Sylvie walks the path of yoga daily, as woman, dancer and artist, sharing her yoga knowledge through what she considers to be her dearest art form, the Art of Teaching.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200863933,"name":"Sylvie Bayeux","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/highres_254443135.jpeg","photo_id":254443135,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/member_254443135.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/thumb_254443135.jpeg"}},"members":58,"name":"Midtown East Yoga & Dance","id":19659610,"state":"NY","urlname":"Midtown-East-Yoga-Dance","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Yoga Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457110783000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"movement","name":"Social Movements","id":10460},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"youth","name":"Youth","id":21017},{"urlkey":"giving-back-to-the-community-engaging-our-youth","name":"Giving Back to the Community - Engaging Our Youth","id":26414},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"youth-leadership-development","name":"Youth Leadership Development","id":33934},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement","name":"Civic Engagement","id":37181},{"urlkey":"compassion","name":"Compassion","id":51582},{"urlkey":"social-and-political-activism","name":"Social and Political Activism","id":80680},{"urlkey":"economic-and-social-justice","name":"Economic and Social Justice","id":235581}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CompassionConvos-NYC-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"\n#CompassionConvos is a global compassion movement challenging bias through civic engagement and compassionate action.

That is why I have made this giant leap for the other 83% of mankind who were made to feel somehow defective because of AA <br>1 acknowledge that u r not powerless I mean u dragged ur ass to this meeting right? U r trying to take control of ur life so commend urself for that <br>2 write down every craving u have and I guarantee u will find them to be fewer and further between. Also write down everything u have tried in the past to get sober and everything u will do differently. Notice how much prouder u already feel&nbsp; <br>3 if step two is hard because the last thing u wanna do when u have a craving is sit and stew in it, reach out for help. Real friends will be happy to help <br>4 try and remember a time when u knew urself and imagine urself at that age and what pure joys made u happy. Whatever it may be I guarantee u will involuntarily smile <br>5 through the reflection and meditation of step four u should be capable of finding the strength and power within urself: the strength that brought ur ass to this meeting and will hopefully prepare u for the next step <br>6 it is true that u will have to make amends to someone I mean lets be real but u may not always get the response u want so for every apology u make remind urself of something good u have done too even if that good thing is simply getting sober! <br>7 this one is a little tricky granted but will definitely help: think back to when u were a child and try to remember anything u were obsessed with whether it was a boy girl food or the idea of being popular. If u realize that the disease effected u before u encountered the drug then the next step will not be easy <br>8 by this point things in ur life that were once easy have now become incredibly hard, if they weren't then u would not be an addict. So while the main person u should be doing this for is u there are I'm sure other people in ur life or whom u would like back in ur life that u wish to be stronger for. Just think about them <br>9 confront those people and tell them U want to help them but u may need their help too. If u don't get the response u want remember step6 but the positive feedback is certain to keep u going at least for a while <br>10 by now the pressure of everyone accepting u again is building and you want to trip over ur own foot so u have no one else to blame. At this point return to steps 1,3&amp;4 even simultaneously. Remember that power inside urself? It may feel dim but it cannot be snuffed out. After all ur still alive right?&nbsp; <br>I'll admit I cannot promise that this alone will make me happy but I can tell u it gave me the hope of a happy future. My name is Ellie. And I am an addict <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3330981,"name":"David Hantman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/highres_251120955.jpeg","photo_id":251120955,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/member_251120955.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/thumb_251120955.jpeg"}},"members":24,"name":"New York Support and Recovery Meetup","id":19667587,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Support-and-Recovery-Meetup","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457220511000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"directors","name":"Directors","id":21003},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"film-makers","name":"Filmmaking","id":31082},{"urlkey":"meeting-filmmakers-producers-agents","name":"Meeting Filmmakers, Producers, Agents","id":44095},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"grip","name":"Grip","id":86715},{"urlkey":"gaffer","name":"Gaffer","id":86717},{"urlkey":"director-of-photography","name":"Director of Photography","id":86718},{"urlkey":"writers-and-aspiring-writers","name":"Writers and Aspiring Writers","id":163796},{"urlkey":"the-film-crew","name":"The Film Crew","id":216241}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/film-crew-collaborators\/","rating":4.67,"description":"Film Crew Collaborators NYC is a group for filmmakers.

Do you do booty calls? Do you have a friend with benefits situation you are considering? Well, let me tell you about this awesome group!<\/p>\n<p>This group is for singles (especially women) who have woken up from the Disney fantasy you have been sold and are looking for more logical, sensible and fun relationships. Marriage is great and all but finding a life partner is no small task and you are NOT getting any younger. Maybe you have given up or maybe you still looking but in the meantime, you have a desire for some kind of physical intimacy. You can find somebody in this group or use this group as a support network to help you find somebody. Let's also share ideas and talk about ways to make non-traditional relationships work. How do you avoid getting hurt? How can you be safe? What about dealing with societal issues like women being shamed for having casual relationship? Is there a wrong way and right way to make it work? Let's meet up and do something fun as we talk about things in a safe environment where you don't have to worry about being judged. <br> <br>Although all daters are welcome, this group is more for confident daters who probably could do well with traditional dating if they so chose, but that is not their goal. The daters in this group should ideally not have problems attracting \"good people\" to date, it's just it's more about not finding what THEY want. Like with myself, if I just wanted a traditional girlfriend, I'd have no problem. The problem comes only with finding a woman who I actually want that with. The non-traditional dating options come in with what I do in the meanwhile until I find what I want for the long term.<\/p>\n<p>So ultimately this group is not really about attracting a partner but rather figuring out how to make non-traditional dating options work. It's about once you already find the partner you seek, how does it all work? We are open to discussing all kinds of options from non-sexual type relationships, OGBC, FWB, XWSEX,&nbsp; Cougar or whatever works for YOU, with the one exception of cheating. If that is your thing, that is on you, but this group cannot support you with that.<\/p>","lon":-74.0800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/highres_447741966.jpeg","photo_id":447741966,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/600_447741966.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/thumb_447741966.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":201053631,"name":"Carl","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/highres_254538105.jpeg","photo_id":254538105,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/member_254538105.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/thumb_254538105.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Hasbrouck Heights to hell with tradional Dating Meetup","id":19673746,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Hasbrouck-Heights-to-hell-with-tradional-Dating-Meetup","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Dating Rebels"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Forest Hills","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457345866000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pingpong","name":"Ping Pong","id":3262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Ping-Pong-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Want to play some recreational ping pong, join us at a club here in Forest Hills!

Recently, with improvements in hi-tech tools in cognitive neuroscience, such as EEG and fMRI devices, we can see brain activity better and more clearly than ever before. In addition, with affordable technologies such as tablets, smartphones, Google Glass, etc., we can design more individualized learning media.\n\nDetermining how each student learns based on cognitive neuroscience and designing digital media for learning based on educational theories will lead to success in more students\u2019 learning. Current teaching methods are only targeting a specific group of students; however, we need more individualized learning. We are losing many talents along the way due to our poor understanding of how people learn and our inability to adjust instruction to meet each student\u2019s particular need. \n\nThis group aims to contribute to the study of mind, brain, technology and education to identify individual differences among students, create learning design principles for designing more individualized digital learning media and techniques to improve students\u2019 learning capacity. We believe the social environment affects learning as much as genetics, and we believe each student has their limitations and strengths. It is our mission to encourage students to take advantage of their strengths and to work with them to improve their limitations. \n\nThis group welcomes Cognitive Neuroscientists, Technologists, Educators and any person who is interested in using cognitive neuroscience to improve digital media design for

The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative is a series of individual learning events focused on leadership topics that are relevant to both work and personal life. Each leadership development event features a guest speaker with a deep level of expertise on a relevant topic, along with facilitated dialogue and exercises that help participants to apply knowledge to life and work. OPERATING PRINCIPLES 1. We seek to Democratize Leadership Development We believe great development opportunities should be available to anyone, anywhere. The cost however, in both time and money, can be prohibitive for many people to participate. This is especially true for individuals on a limited budget, small business owners, individual realtors and consultants, government officials, and those engaged in non-profit organizations. For people in for-profit business organizations, our offerings will complement your in- house training at a very competitive fee. To help democratize leadership development, our fees will always be reasonable, and based on the presenter's fee and costs for each event. Plus, we will allow you to self- select lower fees, if needed. We even offer a fee where you can choose to attend in exchange for performing a good deed. It will be that easy to afford! 2. Knowledge is an expense, while Applied Knowledge is development and an investment. As an example, take the simple transaction of purchasing a self-help or business book, ideally at your local bookstore. You finish reading the book, but you do not find any content meaningful to you and, as a result, you do not apply any of the content. We would suggest the purchase of this book is an expense. In another instance, you purchase and complete a different self-help or business book, you find the content relevant and, as a result, apply the content and it improves an aspect of your life\/work. This purchase can be characterized as an investment, as you received a return on your investment of the cost of this book. follow up with coaching or peer group meetings. 3. We will always do our Good Deed! In the spirit of creating meaningful change in the world, The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative will donate the net proceeds of each learning event to designated organizations that have a clear purpose of positively contributing to their community.","lon":-74.2699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201100640,"name":"John Harvey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/highres_254563924.jpeg","photo_id":254563924,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/member_254563924.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/thumb_254563924.jpeg"}},"members":81,"name":"Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative","id":19677729,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Maplewood-Leadership-Development-Initiative","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Particpants"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edgewater","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457405339000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"sound-therapy-healing","name":"Sound Therapy & Healing","id":25952},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"gong-sound-bath-meditation","name":"GONG SOUND BATH MEDITATION","id":293601},{"urlkey":"healing-with-sacred-sounds","name":"HEALING WITH SACRED SOUNDS","id":293651},{"urlkey":"gongs-tibetan-singing-bowls-crystal-bowls","name":"Gongs.

All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

In this powerful and comprehensive professional two-day training, you will receive everything you need to become a confident and successful Shamanic Reiki I practioner. You will learn to harness this powerful healing energy and channel it to yourself and others. Becoming a Reiki practioner opens energy channels in the body and the spirit. This can lead to deep and profound changes in your quality of life, sense of self, and your ability to manifest. Not to mention giving yourself a holistic way to work with your own physical challenges. Even after a Reiki I training, students often experience a heightened sense of intuition and even psychic sense. Life direction can become clearer, as well as a heightened ability to hold love in a deeper way. Reiki teaches us to align with our innate compassion and goodness, and opens us to new possibilities. Finally, in Reiki, the \u2018healer is made\u2019. We are all healers, and Reiki is said to lie dormant in our DNA, waiting for us to excavate it and use it for the benefit of others and the world. The following will be covered in this SHAMANIC REIKI I class: - Historical background of Traditional Usui Reiki - In depth definition of what Reiki is and what it can do - Shamanic journeying for healing - The hand positions to treat self and others - Working with plants and stones - Energetic extraction and Soul Healing - The Reiki I Attunement Ceremony - The alchemy of healing - Reiki ethics - Using Reiki to cure specific conditions (physical and emotional) - Using Reiki to empower your goals - The energy body (the Aura)and the Chakras - You will learn to do administer a full Reiki treatment - A detailed reiki manual - A certificate of completion - Lots of love and personal attention REIKI, as defined by the International Center for Reiki Training Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by the \u201claying on of hands\u201d and is based on the idea that an unseen \u201clife force energy\u201d flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means \u201cGod\u2019s Wisdom or the Higher Power\u201d and Ki which is \u201clife force energy.\u201d So Reiki is actually \u201cspiritually guided life force energy.\u201d In a Reiki class, one receives a Reiki \u2018attunement\u2019 \u2014 the Reiki Master facilitates a transference of universal life force energy to the student. The student is then able to work with Reiki energy at will.

We are excited to announce that we have scheduled our <b>Kick-Off Meeting for April 11th from 10am-12pm;<\/b> you may already RSVP if you are planning on attending. We will then have our <b>first 2-3 mile walk as a group at Little Bay Park on April 18th at 10am<\/b>. Our spring schedule is complete and we will be adding meet ups to our group calendar shortly.<\/p>\n<p>Now for a little background on your <b>group organizers, Larissa and Debra.<\/b> We are Personal Wellness Coaches as well as Independent Product Distributors for Herbalife. Our goal, up until now, was to simply reach as many people as we could (between our full time Mommy positions) and assist our clients on their personal journeys; health, fitness and nutrition were the focal points of our coaching. While this is still something we love to do, we have learned a few things along the way of our own journeys.<\/p>\n<p><b>Social\/Group Walking<\/b> has been proven to work on many levels. The one that stood out most for us was the community aspect. The fields of fitness and nutrition need a community of like minded people to be there to support one another. When you set out to make a lifestyle change, you need a cheering section and someone to help you up when you stumble. Change can be scary, so having others to offer their experiences, knowledge and accomplishments is a great way to keep your confidence and momentum going. While some are able to achieve success without a community standing behind them, difficulties may emerge, weight will be put back on, meal planning and prepping will no longer be enjoyable, and suddenly, many find themselves right back where they started.<\/p>\n<p><b>We are hoping for a large variety of excited participants from different backgrounds, decades, generations and cultures.<\/b> The individuals that we believe will benefit most from our vision are simply those who believe in the benefits of exercising with a group. <b>Walking, in particular, is a low impact form of exercise that mostly everyone can do on a regular basis. <\/b>We are not looking to conduct high intensity classes, or incorporate weights and other fitness apparatus that would make it difficult to focus on our main objectives of fitness and socialization. Members, you are invited to bring your children, strollers, and babies. Pet parents, your dogs are also welcomed. We see each and every one of you as a valuable member of our growing community and we will not place restrictions on members when at all possible.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to us that our members understand that we are a social walking group and our visions and goals are geared towards creating a community based on the common interest of leading healthier, more active lifestyles. While we may incorporate Herbalife into some of our Meet ups, <b>our main objective is to create our community of Whitestone Walking Warriors<\/b> <b>and make it something we can all be proud of. Members will never be required to take part in Herbalife in order to continue with our Meet ups. <\/b>Herbalife taught us one of the most valuable lessons in the health and fitness field: a community is essential. A strong, active, committed community knows no bounds when it comes to supporting one another on their personal wellness journeys.<\/p>\n<p>We are really looking forward to putting our plan into action!

Otherwise, it's an uphill battle, with us trying to force ourselves into thinking or being a certain way.

Chopra's meditation method is very simple and easy to understand.<\/p>\n<p>I give the basic instructions and we practice silent meditation for about 20 minutes. We reinforce the practice with a centering thought from Chopra's teachings. &nbsp;We also suggest daily mindful activities so that with practice they become habits of a healthy and focused mind. &nbsp;Meditation is the basic tool for a more wholesome relaxed life and when it is paired with mindful action it becomes the key that unlocks your connection to your intrinsic nature that is whole, creative and happy.<\/p>\n<p>I am Chopra Center certified meditation instructor and a meditation based life coach. Meditation is the basis to my practice, and I often lead seminars &amp; workshops.&nbsp;<br><\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/b\/5\/highres_447995253.jpeg","photo_id":447995253,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/b\/5\/600_447995253.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/b\/5\/thumb_447995253.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12315447,"name":"Monica","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/7\/highres_254823655.jpeg","photo_id":254823655,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/7\/member_254823655.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/7\/thumb_254823655.jpeg"}},"members":295,"name":"Deepak Chopra NY Meditation & Mindfulness Group","id":19709763,"state":"NY","urlname":"Deepak-Chopra-NY-Mediation-and-Mindfulness-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Mindful Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Ridgewood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458001292000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"workathome","name":"Work At Home","id":589},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"communityorg","name":"Community Organizations","id":10485},{"urlkey":"coworking","name":"Coworking","id":14990},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-professionals","name":"Business Professionals","id":16922},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"remote-workers","name":"Remote Workers","id":25673},{"urlkey":"start-ups","name":"start-ups","id":130937},{"urlkey":"digital-nomads","name":"Digital Nomads","id":678452}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ridgewood-Coworking-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Working together, we are building a vibrant community and support network.

How you define yourself often limits you to playing a role, rather than developing an expanding sense of purpose. The truth is, these are simply our roles in society, not who we truly are. What happens when we attach ourselves to these roles too much? Attachment to our roles leads to overwhelming expectations, self-judgment, negative thoughts and beliefs. We can have expectations of attaining the perfect version of whatever role we are in, have fears of vulnerability, and judge ourselves harshly. We can become plagued with self-doubt: Am I smart enough? Am I good enough? Our thoughts and beliefs lead to our perceptions about the world and ourselves. It is as if we have blinders on which we seem to have no choice and a limited view on everything. Because of this, we are disconnected from others and ourselves. Success and happiness seem unreachable. How can we live a life where we honor who we really are, make conscious choices unaffected by misconceptions, and create the success and happiness we want? Mission: Transcend Group Coaching is a network of individuals that are on the journey to understand themselves better and create deep connection to others by supporting each other in living passionate and authentic lives. Through releasing these attachments to our roles, we can live more authentically, honoring who we truly are, and enjoying every moment. Together this group will support each other in reducing unrealistic societal, familial, and personal expectations. We will break through barriers we have created with in ourselves for years and live more in the present moment. We will reduce fear and judgment while increasing happiness, success, and connection. Imagine this new you at a crowded party, talking to someone you are attracted to; at a work event; or an awkward family gathering, having the confidence to connect with people in new ways, having meaningful conversation, and engaging with others like never before. In this group you will release self-doubt, fear, loneliness, and insecurities, and replace it with confidence, courage, and a support network to live a connected, conscious, and aware life. In my coaching practice, I have been recognized for my ability to ask thought-provoking questions to help individuals and groups dig deeper into exploring who they are and what is important to them. With monthly conference phone calls, an online community forum, weekly discussion questions, and individually defined actions steps, I will help create an environment of support, motivation, and inspiration. We will break down physical, mental, and spiritual barriers that have gotten in the way of connecting with others and ourselves. The fact is that everyone has challenges, limiting beliefs, assumptions and judgments about themselves and the world. Together we will embrace our challenges, understand our desires, and live our purpose\u2026 Get ready to Transcend! The Benefits of Conference Calls for Group Coaching As we connect with people around us we are drawn to similarities. We are attracted to people that look like us, have similar clothing or other outward traits. These superficial characteristics can either create connection with people or stop us from getting to know them. It is common to put more weight on these superficial characteristics of people but the reality is that it can keep us from getting to know them in deeper ways. Through group phone conversation, we will transcend physical superficial barriers and focus instead on the energy, values, and beliefs of each person. It will help create a new way of being. With this new awareness, we will honor what makes us all unique, truly learning from each other and growing together.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201707330,"name":"Carson Cooper","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/highres_254861845.jpeg","photo_id":254861845,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/member_254861845.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/thumb_254861845.jpeg"}},"members":43,"name":"New York Transcend Group Coaching","id":19724076,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Transcend-Group-Coaching","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Transcenders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458263503000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"politicalcafe","name":"Political Cafe","id":3334},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"critical-thinking","name":"Critical Thinking","id":15544},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-socials","name":"Coffee and Tea Socials","id":18105},{"urlkey":"vote","name":"Vote","id":19278},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"elections","name":"Elections","id":40198},{"urlkey":"national-politics","name":"National Politics","id":112476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversation-Group-Lets-Talk-About-Trump\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>***THIS IS NOT A PRO OR ANTI TRUMP GROUP.

Tired of clicking \"submit\" to hundreds of online applications and not receiving any responses? Do the pixels on your computer screen seem to be moving because you've been staring at it for so long? This group is designed for those that are unemployed and looking for a career or those that are looking to transition careers. Family and friends can provide only so much support, but I found the most comfort in people who were in the same situation as myself. The goal is to provide you with free professional development advice and strategy to help you in your career search. Whether you're a new graduate looking for your first career or a tenured professional looking to transition, all are welcome. Additionally, if you are in a neighboring area (Hoboken), feel free to attend. I believe that anyone who joins this group has something to offer, you may not know it yet. There are so many online resources to help with your job search that it can be overwhelming. I would like to put it out there that there are multiple opinions on how to handle job searching and these are just my own. Find what works best for you and try new avenues if what you're doing isn't working. I am starting this group because I want to help give others more opportunities to succeed in their job search. I know firsthand that unemployment\/career transition can leave you feeling a little lost and in need of some direction. All suggestions are welcome - interview prep, resume critique, professional dress, rolling over your 401k from a previous employer without penalty or taxes, etc. I realize that working in a team is better than working alone. If you are a professional that is looking to contribute back to your community, please let me know and we can meetup and find ways to make this group more effective.

If you love the beach and love being around like minded people, this could be an opportunity for you. The group shares a beautiful 6 bedroom house in beautiful Sea Girt, NJ that is a mere 1 block to the beach and 1 block from the popular Parker House bar\/restaurant. This is by far the nicest house and most conveniently located still available for this type rental. If you live in the city or Hoboken, as many that spend the summer in this town are, there is mass transit that can take you back and forth so many spend SUnday night and do the direct morning commute into work. Still available are about 8 half shares that will allow you to use the house every other weekend as well as mid-weeks when your schedule allows. If you have a group of 3, there is still the opportunity to share the master bedroom with your own private bath. If you are not familiar with this type living and meeting arrangement, there is none better; feel free to reach out with questions and photos of the house.","lon":-74.0299987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":136853602,"name":"Jerry","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/highres_255585404.jpeg","photo_id":255585404,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/member_255585404.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/5\/c\/thumb_255585404.jpeg"}},"members":36,"name":"Sea Girt Jersey Shore Summer **Adults**Group Rental","id":19745572,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Sea-Girt-Jersey-Shore-Summer-Group-Rental-Adults","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Beach Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458684652000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wordpress","name":"WordPress","id":8304},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"drupal","name":"Drupal","id":10358},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"content-strategy","name":"Content Strategy","id":24417},{"urlkey":"augmented-reality","name":"Augmented Reality","id":26061},{"urlkey":"virtual-reality","name":"Virtual Reality","id":26062},{"urlkey":"content-management","name":"Content Management","id":26910},{"urlkey":"cms","name":"CMS (Content Management Systems)","id":28990},{"urlkey":"sitecore-cms","name":"Sitecore CMS","id":52276},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/future-content\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In the same way the content industry was disrupted by the advent of the internet, it is poised for another wave of disruption with the emergence of connected devices and 3D experiences for consuming content.

We take a 'no pressure' and 'no force' approach to our trips where we offer our people to be a part of BornWild without the pressure of educational talks on wild animals, nor do our travellers need to have a strong interest in Wild Animals. All we ask is for you to come along, have fun, meet new people and enjoy the social gathering. BornWild is different, as the profits we make, we personally donate a generous donation to wild animal charities. Not only will you have an amazing time with us, you'll be helping make the world a better place too.

Solely moving to a new culture is already a challenging process: struggles with the language, the herculean task of finding an apartment, learning your way around the city, making new friends and so on. But as you might have already noticed, there\u2019re many other challenges involved in adjusting to a new cultural environment - especially one so diverse and multi-layered as we encounter in NYC.

Dennis is a Holistic Health and Fitness Coach, as well as a Crossfit Level 1 trainer. He is HUGE into sports, fitness, healthy eating, preventing diseases, gut health and an incredible inspiration to our family, friends, his clients and mostly myself. I grew up passionate about dancing, painting, being outdoors in nature but for over 10 years, I have been challenged with ADHD problems and smoking addiction, which caused me to steer away form myself and from what I love. Upon meeting Dennis, I had the strong desire to change but I always felt like I was alone in my journey. Now, after almost 2 years I have been enjoying a much fresher side of life, mainly because I discovered that unhealthy habits, loneliness and depression can be best cured through movement, through being outdoors, connecting with nature and mainly through sharing this experience with other people. I love Dennis' approach to exercise and fitness, not because he is my husband, but because he is extremely creative in making workouts fun, playful, unique in such a way that while you sweat all the 'bad' stuff, you gain some great laughs with your team mates. This is something I feel like is missing in the \"gym\" world and wanted to bring it out to you too, because I know it helps, because I know you will love it too and because you will want to start moving not because you have to but because you want to. We began this type of group training, while living in New Zealand. It felt so refreshing that we decided to bring it to you too, here in New York, so you can also experience a Fresh New Day.

Me, as a non-native English speaker of 3.5 years of speaking experience, I've experience a huge development of my own characteristic and identity along the process of learning English.<\/p>\n<p>In this meet-up, I'm planning to have Japanese language classes for all different levels, Calligraphy classes, and some casual meet-up activities to explore Japanese restaurants and places!<\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>Beginner: hiragana &amp; katakana exercises, essential-practical vocabulary &amp; grammar - Genki I<\/p> \n <p>Intermediate: Some professional-business terms of expressions &amp; completing grammar - Genki II<\/p> \n <p>Advanced: grammar and vocabulary reviews, using short articles &amp; stories for reading, writing responses, discussion<\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Please feel free to message me for any requests &amp; questions.<\/p>\n<p><span><b>*In order to attend lectures, pre-payment through PayPal is&nbsp;<\/b><span>required.<\/span><b>&nbsp;Also every 4 meet-up attendance will get you $5 discount for my private lessons!<\/b> The details for private lessons are here:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/japanese-language-tutoring-by-kazuma-s\/japanese-as-a-second-language-tutoring-service-by-kazuma-s\/546114902218829\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/japanese-lan...<\/a> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/d\/2\/highres_448397618.jpeg","photo_id":448397618,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/d\/2\/600_448397618.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/d\/2\/thumb_448397618.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182760165,"name":"Kazuma S.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/e\/8\/highres_255454536.jpeg","photo_id":255454536,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/e\/8\/member_255454536.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/6\/e\/8\/thumb_255454536.jpeg"}},"members":66,"name":"Japanese Language & Calligraphy Lectures \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5","id":19780287,"state":"NY","urlname":"Japanese-Language-Calligraphy-Practice","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Japanese Learners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459412977000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"koreanpop","name":"Korean Pop","id":10442},{"urlkey":"interracial-relationships","name":"Interracial Relationships","id":25502},{"urlkey":"interracial-singles","name":"Interracial singles","id":25503},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"asian-men-caucasian-ladies","name":"Asian Men, Caucasian Ladies","id":47480},{"urlkey":"c-pop-j-pop-k-pop","name":"C-POP J-POP K-POP","id":161127},{"urlkey":"western-women-and-asian-men","name":"western women and asian men","id":439762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AsianMenLovers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Asian men.

Let's get to know each other, develop relationships, share common challenges, vent, share stories and support one another as best as we can. Are you in?<\/p>\n<p>Mamas, we\u2019re raising little humans here, and it is scary. And some days, the only voice in your head is the one screaming, You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing......

The energy that is created when we share our thoughts and experiences is fulfilling, reassuring, and the main reason why we are drawn to these types of gatherings. The group meets to discuss the concepts presented in the CWG (\u201cConversations With God\u201d) books written by Neale Donald Walsch. Neale's books have been on the NY Times best sellers list for years, have been translated into numerous languages, and have been sold all around the world. His writing style allows his readers to understand and engage in concepts that can sometimes be difficult or intimidating to confront. He handles the big issues such as the meaning of life, where we go when we die, and what God is really all about. He has a great sense of humor about himself and life, which makes reading his books both enjoyable and relatable. We enjoy an open-minded and inviting atmosphere where we discuss the ways that CWG has touched our lives. We discuss ways to bring those concepts into our daily lives, what we have struggled with, and how we feel we can spread the message. There is a workbook we use that is a companion to the CWG book. It serves as a guide for incorporating these principles in all aspects of our lives by using exercises and assignments that require us to think critically, and honestly about our experiences. This Meetup is open to anyone who feels the desire to engage in these conversations and to continue (or start) transformation in their lives. If you have not read the CWG books yet, please feel welcome to join us anyway. It is not a requirement of the Meetup, and we will all be happy to share our experiences with you. We will also be reading from the series during our meetings. Purchasing the book(s) is not a requirement, but if you would like to, it is available on Amazon, or www.cwg.org. On the website you will also find information about Neale and all the different resources that are available to you. In a world that is ever changing, and in a time of great need for our planet, we look forward to transforming our lives and the world around us.","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138001172,"name":"Peggy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/highres_254306096.jpeg","photo_id":254306096,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/member_254306096.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/f\/0\/thumb_254306096.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"Montville CWG Social Meetup","id":19790060,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Montville-CWG-Social-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.9099998474,"who":"Living Consciously"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459622216000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"growing-your-business","name":"Growing your business","id":55596}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wellness-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"You don't have to sweat your butt off to be health conscious.

We want to grow our community by bringing together creative and spiritually aligned individuals who want to serve the local community by sharing their gifts, talents, practices, and wisdom. Our programming revolves around self-expression, spiritual practice, and communal inclusion. We are open to all people who wish to empower themselves and those around them in creating a better world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Sacred Arts Research Foundation (SARF) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to provide support for the sacred arts through the provision of funds, space and resources for artists. Our base is at The Ark, a space in Brooklyn, NY where many of our activities occur. SARF seeks to support those who create in the realms of visual arts, music, crafting, performance and healing arts. SARF makes its space (The Ark) and its promotional network available for this purpose. SARF is a community organization which was bred out of the Golden Drum community in Brooklyn, NY. Under the guidance of community leader and Taino elder, Maestro Manuel Rufino, we have come together to create a home for the Sacred Arts in America. Our goal is to create a sustainable organization supported by government funding, grants, donations and income generating activities.

This group is New York City Metro based, but is part of a coordinated network focused on \"smart\" technology, natural and integrated experiences between technology and people as a whole. <\/p> \n<p>Siri pushed a major milestone in user engagement with intelligent speech interfaces, opening the door for natural, augmented reality \/ interaction, showing speech recognition and natural language interaction in a new light to consumers, in a way only researchers had been experiencing for years. Google Voice and Microsoft's Cortana have expanded on that milestone, putting speech technology on track to become a more pervasive part of our daily lives. Supported by a host of devices beyond smartphones, the emergence of smart, in home devices; and wearables, expand the potential and design challenges in front of our industry. We have also seen the emergence of new, and even more compelling form factors, such as Ivee, Martian Watches, Jibo, XOWi, and most recently the Amazon Echo - perhaps Canary and Nest in the future - that will make the arrival of ubiquitous voice possible. <\/p> \n<p>Ubiquitous Voice Society shares a goal to exchange information, learn from each other, network, workshop, and engage in activities that promote the mission of making voice a meaningful, life enhancing interface. &lt;br&gt;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3713538,"name":"Leah","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/2\/8\/highres_255531752.jpeg","photo_id":255531752,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/2\/8\/member_255531752.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/a\/2\/8\/thumb_255531752.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"Ubiquitous Voice Society New York","id":19821970,"state":"NY","urlname":"UVS-NYC","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Ubis"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Fresh Meadows","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460305179000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"drinking","name":"Drinking","id":15546},{"urlkey":"wine-lovers","name":"Wine Lovers","id":15634},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"dinner","name":"Dinner","id":40569},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-drinks","name":"Dinner and Drinks","id":61459},{"urlkey":"local-activities","name":"Local Activities","id":64867},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fresh-Meadows-30s-40s-Women-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>I am looking to start a social group of women who are in their 30's or 40's.

New Yorkers tend to rush from place to place, often not noticing the beautiful, quirky, out-of-place things they pass by. We usually don\u2019t know that there are fascinating stories all around us. Join licensed New York City tour guides, Deb, Laurie and Alan, as they explore New York\u2019s parks, architecture, historical sites and neighborhoods so that together we can see the city as if for the very first time. While we were preparing to get our tour guide licenses, we discovered many fascinating facts about the city, many gems hidden in plain sight, many stories about the movers and shakers and the little guys that nobody remembers. We're bubbling over with excitement, and we want to share our discoveries with other people who love this great city. We also know that the opportunities for learning about and appreciating our city are endless. Meet up with us, sometimes on an interesting street corner, sometimes for a walk, sometimes to visit an out-of-the-way museum or historic area, as we look at the city with fresh eyes. We want to learn more about the city, we love sharing what we know, and we believe that together it will be fun and a great way to meet other urban explorers. \n\nThe group's leaders are all licensed tour guides hoping to build a following. Accordingly, our Meetups will be free for the foreseeable future and are meant to give us an opportunity to practice new tours and visit sites throughout the city with other people who love exploring New York.  We'll ask you to sign up for our free newsletter and to like us on Facebook, but that will be completely voluntary. Each Meetup member will be responsible for their own incidental costs, such as admission fees, food, or transportation. If a member liked the tour or trip and felt our services were helpful, a tip would be welcomed.\n\nTo learn more about us you can visit our website at http:\/\/www.takeawalknewyork.com\/home.html  Our Meetup tours will only be announced through Meetup and will not appear on our Take a Walk New York calendar.","lon":-73.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194967012,"name":"Alan R Cohen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/highres_251037611.jpeg","photo_id":251037611,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/member_251037611.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/0\/b\/thumb_251037611.jpeg"}},"members":203,"name":"NYC explorers meetup","id":19829972,"state":"NY","urlname":"seenycwithfresheyes","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"New York City Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460424994000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"kundalini-yoga","name":"Kundalini Yoga","id":18847},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kundalini-Disco\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Kundalini Disco is a new alternative to Friday nights.
