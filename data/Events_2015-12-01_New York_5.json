But, here, although challenging and certainly requiring\u00a0courage, the teachings speak of renunciation as freedom from or letting go of\u00a0anything that binds us to\u00a0stories\u00a0of suffering we create for ourselves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The\u00a0most common and insistent ways\u00a0we make ourselves unhappy is through our grasping and greediness toward things outside ourselves; things\u00a0we believe will make us feel happy,\u00a0safe, and secure. We want things that stay the same and are\u00a0unchanging. However, despite our best efforts, we can plainly see that everything is really impermanent and always changing. \u00a0When we can deeply accept that reality and apply it to our own\u00a0attachments and desires, the letting go or renunciation of those things\u00a0happens naturally. We\u00a0move toward more freedom from suffering.<\/p> <p>The Ten Perfections or qualities of mind are:<\/p> <p>Generosity (Giving)<br\/>Virtue (Morality\/Ethics)<br\/>Renunciation (Letting go of obstacles to awakening)<br\/>Wisdom (Discernment)<br\/>Energy (Effort)<br\/>Patience (Endurance)<br\/>Truthfulness<br\/>Determination\/Resolution<br\/>Loving Kindness\/Goodwill<br\/>Equanimity (Impartiality and balance)<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

We'll play with corner kicks and throw-ins and 6'x15' big goals. Rotate goalies<\/p> <p>8.

I'm so excited! This is one of my favorite hikes. It's a four-mile loops with scrambling, waterfalls, rope swings, and really nice views of the Hudson. We may stop for food afterwards as well. There's nothing really in the immediate area, but I'll check to see if anything along 9w looks promising. Like I said in my previous posts, I'll be sticking to this time for the hikes I post this season, with the exception of the Oktoberfest one(that one will be 11am), just to make sure we have time for the festivities. Anyway, here are the details:<\/p> <p>The Giant Stairs Area: State Line Length: 4 mi. (includes steep descent, mile-long rock scramble, and a steep climb) Time: 2+ hrs. Map: Map 3 Parking: State Line Lookout Bus Access: See \"Point Lookout\" hike description on our \"Public Transportation\" page This is the \"hike of hikes\" on the Palisades, and we really recommend trying something a little easier first ... the \"Stairs\" are as much rock scramble as hike, with a very steep ascent at the end\u2014never attempt this hike when it\u2019s wet or icy out! Begin this loop hike at Lookout Inn at State Line Lookout. From here, you can begin by going either south or north. To begin south: Begin at Lookout Inn and go to the ski trail entrance at the northwest corner of the parking area. At your first left, take ski trail \"A\" which also overlaps with the aqua-blazed Long Path. Follow until it comes to a junction, where you turn left to cross the entrance road to State Line Lookout (use caution here). Continue through the gap in the parapet stones and into the woods. The trail goes down a ravine on stone steps. At the base of the ravine, the aqua Long Path crosses a wooden bridge and then intersects the blue-and-white-blazed Forest View Trail; here you will turn left (east) on the Forest View Trail, taking it down to the river, where it will end at the white-blazed Shore Trail (this descent is very steep). Take the white Shore Trail north about 0.25 mi. to the beginning of the Giant Stairs, a formation created by thousands of rockslides over the eons. You\u2019ll scramble over the rocks for about 1 mi., following the white blazes all the way (some of these, you\u2019ll notice, are in the shape of half-moons\u2014don\u2019t let this throw you). The Shore Trail finally levels off along the river, and goes to Peanut Leap Cascade. After a steep ascent on the white Shore Trail, turn left (south) on the aqua-blazed Long Path, cross the stream, and follow the Long Path back to start. To begin north: Head north along Old Route 9W, noting the aqua blazes of the Long Path along the way\u2014you\u2019ll be following these markers for the first part of this hike. About 100 yd. along, the Long Path leaves the old cement road and goes into the woods, more or less following the cliff edge (and for a while overlapping Ski Trail E). About 1 mi. along, you come to the State Line Monument and a chain link fence; here the trail jogs right (east) to go around the fence, and begins to descend a series of stone steps, with excellent vistas north toward the Tappan Zee. At the base of the steps, the trail jogs to the left, to bear northwest for a time and so headed away from the river. In less than 0.5 mi., you\u2019ll cross a stream on wooden bridges. Across this stream, turn right (east), at the start of the white-blazed Shore Trail that follows the stream toward the river. Just before the river, this trail gets quite steep and is prone to erosion\u2014use caution. You will arrive at river level at the base of Peanut Leap Cascade. Continue on the white-blazed Shore Trail as it heads south along the Hudson, then follow it over the Giant Stairs, finally to the trailhead of the blue-and-white-blazed Forest View Trail. This will lead you steeply back up to the aqua-blazed Long Path. Here, turn right (north), cross the bridge, still going up, and follow the Long Path back to the starting point. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesChallenging.html#giantStairs\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesChallenging.html#giantStairs<\/a> and here's the pdf map from that site: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/mapGrayscale.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/mapGrayscale.pdf<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthernNewJerseyFriends\/events\/225306588\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Giant Stairs Hike @ State Line Lookout","id":"225306588","time":1447520400000,"updated":1447607327000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346031316000,"name":"Northern New Jersey 20s-40s Friends","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":4646572,"urlname":"NorthernNewJerseyFriends","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Northern New Jersey Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Alpine","address_1":"264 Palisades Interstate Parkway","name":"State Line Lookout","lon":-73.917633,"id":7518482,"state":"NJ","lat":40.963043,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.228717804,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442076507000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Alright guys, the season for pumpkins, beer and hiking is (slowly) approaching.

This is our furthest Uptown meetup yet. OSA is short for Our Saviour's Attonement (Lutheran Church), however, do not let that dissuade you if you follow a certain religion -our use of the community center is of no religious affiliation! This is a Saturday afternoon of tabletop gaming, welcome to all. Also, Please note that this meetup is starting slightly earlier than our last meetups at this location, and will last one extra hour (5 hours total). RSVP as soon as you can commit, because space is limited to 30 people!<\/p> <p>If you haven't attended our other meetups, you can expect to play tabletop games of all sorts; examples include Carcassonne, The Resistance, Castles of Burgundy, Settlers of Catan, Lords of Waterdeep, Agricola, Through the Ages, Magic the Gathering, etc. Feel free to bring any games that you'd like to play with other Uptown Gamers.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our group is renting this space, so, unlike our other meetups to date, I will have to collect an 8 dollar contribution upon attendance. This will be a good venue for our group because we will not feel obligated to buy food or drinks as we do when we have events at bars\/restaurants. The good news, though, is that we are allowed to bring food and (non-alcoholic) beverages into the space, as long as we clean up after ourselves.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our space will be through the southern entrance, and up the stairs in the balcony room. The space is well lit, and has nice folding tables and chairs which will be very conducive to table top gaming. As I mentioned before, the space is limited to 30 people, so I'd ask that you do not RSVP unless you are reasonably certain that you can attend -this is also important because of the contributions that we'll need to collect in order to keep renting this center.<\/p> <p>As always, Uptown Gamers Unite!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-NYC-Board-Gamers\/events\/225882539\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":18000000,"name":"Tabletop games at OSA Community Center!","id":"225882539","time":1447520400000,"updated":1447541222000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431454519000,"name":"Uptown NYC Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18592892,"urlname":"Uptown-NYC-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Uptown Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"212-769-8100","address_1":"Central Park West @79th Street","name":"American Museum of Natural History","lon":-73.98008,"id":841250,"state":"NY","lat":40.783886,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.4029211998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445095448000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Experience all the American Museum of Natural History has to offer and at the same time, meet fun new people and\u00a0make some new friends!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Don't miss our last Museum Meetup of the year!

Andrew Delbanco calls for his resurrection; psychoanalyst Carl Goldberg uses the phrase \"speaking with the devil'' as a metaphor for his work with malevolent patients; Elaine Pagels scrutinizes Satan's roots. Even Philip Roth's Mickey Sabbath bears a striking resemblance to the proud, rebellious, orgiastic Prince of Darkness. And now we are treated to his image in art. Link, a scholar of Elizabethan drama, considers the development of Satan in Western sculpture and painting: the supposed impact of the hairy, horned Pan; the role of the Egyptian dwarf deity, Bes; the addition of black bat-wings in the 14th century, in the work of Giotto. But, according to Link, the Devil never attained the power in visual art that he did in literature.

The idea is to stop every mile or so at pub and have a pint of beer. You can either run, walk or crawl from pub to pub. I will be running the whole six miles. (Hopefully!)<\/p> <p><b>Where did I get this idea?<\/b><\/p> <p>My friend Dolgio read an article about a guy run a marathon while chugging beer every few miles so she thought it would be a brilliant idea to do it for her birthday in November about 5 years ago in Queens. I felt like this should be repeated at least one more time and I have been doing this every year sine adding different courses and changing the bars around.<\/p> <p><b>Can I join in later?<\/b><\/p> <p>Sure, I will update the meetup letting people know what bar we are at. Also I will post my number on the comments section. You can then either text me if you can't find us or send me a Glympse request. Glympse is an app that will show my GPS location for up to four hours after you request it using my phone number.<\/p> <p><b>The Plan:<\/b><\/p> <p>Meet at the East River Ferry landing Center Blvd in LIC.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Black and white may be defined in opposition to each other but this is also what makes them inextricably linked.\u00a0Our evolution is our devolution.\u00a0 Our devolution is our evolution.\u00a0 When we recycle, somewhere deep down inside we acknowledge the hypothetical end of Earth for our species, and when we couple, somewhere deep down inside we resist it.\"<\/p> <p>A visual thread of geometric shapes ties together three groups of black-and-white drawings which contemplate this juxtaposition: primates balance atop modernist, geometric stacks; couples bend and stretch in yoga poses contained in shaped frames; still life drawings of objects and symbols displayed on irregular polygonal bases.\u00a0 Taken together, the works refer to various kinds of transformation; the evolutionary transformation of primate to human; the transformation of one\u2019s body through physical objects or activity; and the oppositional forces of nature and culture.<\/p> <p>Haendel also utilizes both gallery and digital spaces to activate the work on view. In the gallery, black-and-white checkered patterns bisect the floor, interspersed by polygonal bases displaying still life drawings with hand-drawn QR codes, which link to a curated selection of YouTube videos chronicling physical transformation, such as a weight loss journey or the transition from male to female.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/5\/2\/600_444056146.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>2nd Stop: DRISCOLL BABCOCK GALLERY (525 W 25th St) presents: \u00a0Margaret Bowland: Power<\/b><\/p> <p>features 8 new paintings, which marry canonical imagery with contemporary references to blur fact and fiction, challenge cultural hierarchies, and offer alternate narratives. The exhibition also includes Bowland\u2019s first major installation: a transformational bramble of US dollar bills folded into origami roses that twist throughout the gallery on barbed-wire stems, underscoring the dangerous allure of wealth and power.<\/p> <p>Bowland\u2019s paintings construct an anachronistic world dense with symbolic imagery. She employs a variety of sources, from the artistic production of the early modern Deccan plateau of India, to post-Renaissance European paintings, to today\u2019s fashion magazine spreads. In this maelstrom of references, Bowland\u2019s subjects bear the weight of complex power struggles, reckoning with enduring issues of race, gender and agency.<\/p> <p>Symbols of privilege and status pervade each work. Money\u2014perhaps the most obvious symbol of wealth\u2014appears in various forms throughout: it surrounds Bowland\u2019s subjects as it catches fire and burns; it creates, alongside fighter planes, an ironic, decorative fleur-de-lis pattern. In this way, wealth and prestige directly collide with war, violence, and destruction.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/2\/f\/600_443843599.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>3rd stop: PACE \u00a0WIDENLSTEIN GALLERY (534 W 25th St) presents:\u00a0Robert Rauschenberg: Anagrams, Arcadian Retreats, Anagrams (A Pun).\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>the exhibition includes works from three series made during the mid-1990s into the 2000s, where the artist revisited image transfer techniques which he first explored on a smaller scale in the 1950s and 1960s. Using water-soluble inkjet dyes on paper, plaster, and polylaminate surfaces, Rauschenberg made digital color transfers from his photographs. Revealing the artist\u2019s global perspective, the images are often derived from the photographs he took during his extensive international travels. Imagery for the\u00a0<i>Arcadian Retreats<\/i>\u00a0is largely derived from photographs he took in Turkey when he attended the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in 1996. With images transferred manually using a burnishing implement, the artist\u2019s hand is revealed, resulting in painterly and subtly lyrical works.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/1\/3\/600_444112243.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>4th stop: GAGOSIAN GALLERY (555 W 24th St) presents:\u00a0ZENG FANZHI, PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, AND TWO SCULPTURES<\/b><\/p> <p>Zeng is at the forefront of a generation of Chinese artists who have achieved national and international prominence in the wake of the Cultural Revolution of the 1970s. Over the past three decades he has probed the place of the unconscious in the construction of human experience while reflecting on the collective national psyche in the face of broad and accelerated change. In his formative years, he was particularly inspired by the works of German Expressionism and French Romanticism, in which he found precedents for exploring the psychology of selfhood in the throes of societal flux. His searing\u00a0Hospital Triptych No. 1\u00a0(1991), an early example of his virtuosic application of historical styles and techniques to interpret contemporary national realities, was shown in the pivotal exhibition \u201cChina's New Art, Post-1989\u201d at the Hong Kong Arts Center in 1993.<\/p> <p>With time, Zeng has tempered the direct impact of Western Expressionism with the local influence of traditional\u00a0guohuapainting methods. His eloquent and confrontational work is charged with melancholy, unfolding in a succession of dystopic themes, both introspective and overtly socially critical.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/2\/9\/600_444112521.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>5th stop: MARY BOONE GALLERY (541 W 24th St) presents: PETER SAUL, SIX CLASSICS<\/b><\/p> <p>At age 81 and with 800 paintings to his credit, New York-based painter Peter Saul\u2019s work is as fresh, singular, and thought-provoking as it ever has been.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u201cI know it\u2019s a bit of an awful thing to say, but I really just make things up,\u201d says Saul. \u201cMy main goal is to make a picture that people find interesting to look at and that has my name on it.\u201d<\/p> <p>His work is bright, bold, and abstract. Sometimes the paintings are cartoonish and grotesque, sometimes they are realistic and elegant. Despite the paintings\u2019 absurdities, there is startling notions of truth in them. A strong sense of humor and unabashed love for painting always breathe through the canvases. But few artists have ever developed a style as instantly identifiable as Peter Saul.<\/p> <p>Saul\u2019s most recent exhibition at Mary Boone Gallery,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maryboonegallery.com\/exhibitions\/2015-2016\/Saul\/index.html\">\u00a0Six Classics<\/a>, finds the artist re-imagining six masterpieces from art history. Paying heed to his time as a wide-eyed young artist living in Paris in the late \u201950s and \u201960s, Saul recreates\u00a0Alexandre Cabanel\u2019s \u2018The Birth of Venus\u2019 (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), Jacques-Louis David\u2019s \u2018Napoleon Crossing the Alps\u2019 (versions at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison and the Palace of Versailles), Hyacinthe Rigaud\u2019s full-length portrait \u2018Louis XIV\u2019 and Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault\u2019s \u2018The Raft of the Medusa\u2019 (both in the Louvre).

Ardently concentrating on life-size freestanding figures, these works represent some of the artist\u2019s most significant bodies of work, lent from museums and private collections from around the world.<\/p> <p>Szapocznikow, over the distilled course of fifteen years, developed a profound pioneering vision and formal language tensioned between lust and sexuality, and the threat of destruction. Embodying this dichotomy, her work contains an intense vividness of life that perhaps can be drawn to her personal history, surviving a youth in concentration camps; like a number of artists of her time, such as Paul Thek and Hannah Wilke, who came out of intensity, there is an incredible rigor and vibrance driven from the force of life.<\/p> <p>At once seductive and unsettling, Szapocznikow\u2019s work is often made from direct impressions and casts of body parts, each an attempt to fix the traces of the body and record the fleeting moments and absurd paradoxes of life. She infused a completely new set of materials: those she concocted and heavily documented in the laboratory of her studio\u2014such as tinted polyester resin and polyurethane expanding foam\u2014creating a post-human form of lamps that used casts made directly from her lips, to every day resources\u2014pantyhose, newspaper clippings, photographs, with straw and resin, grass and foam\u2014resulting in distinctly radical hybrids of the organic and inorganic.<br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/4\/2\/600_444112802.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>7th stop: METRO PICTURES (519 W 24th St) presents: CAMILLE HENROT, New Works<\/p> <p>\u00a0programmed self-help hotlines, which the artist developed in collaboration with writer Jacob Bromberg.<\/p> <p>Instead of asking if we need help scheduling an appointment or rebooking a flight, Henrot\u2019s hotlines, for example, prompt us to \u201cpress 5 if your dog manipulates you with lies, contradictions or promises.\u201d Guiding you through a labyrinthine series of inane questions, the voice on the other end transforms from the trusted authority into the patronizing patriarch or shaming schoolteacher. In this parodic exaggeration of the frustrating nature and absurdity of automated hotlines, Henrot questions who within a society is an authority, why we accept them as such, and asks why we submit to being held hostage to these systems while waiting for a desired outcome.<\/p> <p>As viewers dial their way through the dizzying hotline, which at first amuses but ultimately exasperates, we are left with a sense of disappointment. We are disappointed because the authority, \u201cthe man in charge,\u201d has finally failed to meet our expectations.<\/p> <p>Henrot\u2019s new watercolor drawings represent anthropomorphic animal figures to illustrate unjust, unfair and abusive scenes taken from sources ranging from mythology to gossip blogs. The imagery recalls the disturbing actions and remorseless characters familiar in cartoons and comics. Similar to those genres, Henrot employs human-like animals with a sparring and winsome style, which in Henrot\u2019s drawings evokes Modernist painters like Matisse and cartoonists such as Saul Steinberg. In one drawing, a happy couple stands casually as their unborn child bursts from inside the belly of a parent\u2014the figure\u2019s sex left undefined\u2014to reveal it\u2019s grimacing face, while in another, a pelican father stands with a snide expression in his eyes as he eats his young.<br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/a\/0\/600_444112896.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>8th stop: GLADSTONE GALLERY (515 W 24th St) presents:\u00a0Carroll Dunham, New Works<\/p> <p>\u00a0nine large-scale paintings drawing on the nude bathers and pastoral landscapes familiar from Dunham\u2019s works since the late 2000s. The new paintings show the evolution of the artist\u2019s bathers, while making room for new subjects to enter the frame and complicate the visual terrain, including animals and a nude male figure introduced here in paintings for the first time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Throughout his career, Dunham has developed images that would become paintings through drawing. For the first time, this exhibition will show a suite of such studies, for\u00a0Horse and Rider (My X),\u00a0alongside the painting. Arranged chronologically, the graphite drawings reveal the evolution of Dunham\u2019s motifs and compositions over a period of two years. In addition to elucidating the development of the painting, the works demonstrate the strength and range of Dunham\u2019s drawing practice.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/e\/f\/e\/600_444112990.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>9th Stop: BRYCE WOLKOWITZ GALLERY (505 W 24th St) presents: \u00a0STEPHEN WILKES, DAY TO NIGHT<\/p> <p><i>Day to Night<\/i>\u00a0is an ongoing global photographic project that began in 2009. Working from a fixed camera angle, Wilkes captures the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes. After 24 hours of photographing and over 1500 images taken, he selects the best moments of the day and night. Using time as a guide, all of these moments are seamlessly blended into a single photograph in post-production, visualizing places that are part of our collective memory.<br\/>\u00a0\nWilkes sees the camera not only as a device used to capture images, but also as an instrument to collect information.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/e\/a\/600_444113226.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>10th stop: GALARIE RICHARD \u00a0(514 W 24th Sreeet) presents: \u00a0LI WEI, PHOTOGRAPHS<\/p> <p>\u00a0ten selected photo-performances Li Wei has staged between 2000 and 2012 in China and worldwide. They attest the variety and the universalism of his subjects and his exceptional creativity beyond limits. Li Wei\u2019s art is made for New York City, the city of Batman and Spiderman, a city for competitors that go further than anybody else to make the difference. Like Leonardo da Vinci who invented a flying machine for humans, Li Wei works deal with the concept of escaping physical gravity. They can be frightening like the feeling of falling (Icarus) and the feeling of vertigo. They can be liberating with the pleasant feeling to fly. His photographs can be humorous with a reverse gravity pushing you up. They open you to all possibilities like running on the sea or standing on a cloud like gods and saints in religious paintings. The show displays some of his first works representing the artist\u2019s head floating in space. Two of them relate a relationship between him and a young woman.<\/p> <p><br\/>Li Wei's art is a difficult and complex process mixing acrobatics and photography. Floating in the air, on the top of a skyscraper, or falling upside down from the sky, with his head embedded into the ground, the Chinese artist mobilizes cranes, helicopters, scaffoldings and thin steal wires to be tied on his ankles and\/or other parts of his body to hold himself up or catch himself not falling down to achieve his preconceived perfect images. Only the wires and scaffolding that keep Li Wei's body suspended have been cropped out of the photos with Photoshop. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/5\/c\/600_444113340.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>11th stop: PAULA COOPER GALLERY (529 W 21st St) presents: JUSTIN MATHERLY, New works<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/6\/6\/600_444115398.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>12th stop: TONYA BONAKDAR GALLERY (521 W 21st St) presents: MARK MANDERS, SELECTED WORKS<\/p> <p>Mark Manders' sculptures and installations present a surreal space wherein contradictions co-exist: the past and the future, the temporary and the permanent, the beautiful and the grotesque, the tender and the brutal. In the current exhibition, the viewer experiences the artist\u2019s studio in the ground floor gallery, while the upstairs presentation moves the work to a place beyond its origin. This range of new sculptures highlights the juxtaposition of carefully rendered figurative elements, architectural fragments and altered everyday materials, thrusting the world we know into sharp contrast and heightening our perceptual understanding. This ongoing \u201cself-portrait,\u201d like chapters in a non-linear autobiography, gives physical form to a dreamlike psychological space where each object is rendered with subtle alteration of scale or other detail: a chair back made of painted fictional newspaper, figurative elements realized smaller or larger than human scale. Universally familiar terms such as \"dog,\" \"head,\" and \"chair\" are realized as objects combined to create abstract sentences. Produced through an intimate logic, the works appear at once just made and also enigmatically atemporal.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/d\/f\/8\/600_444135864.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>13th stop: GLADSTONE GALLERY (530 W 21st St) presents: JEAN TINGUELY, SCULPTURAL WORKS from[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>works by the artist from 1954 through 1991.

He installed old motors, often decommissioned from 78rpm phonographs, onto his sculptures to produce unpredictable and non-repeating motion.\u00a0Within these dynamic sculptures of chance, accident, and inconsistency,\u00a0Tinguely\u2019s sculptures often entertain or agitate the audience with their humor and irony.\u00a0Tinguely\u00a0is\u00a0perhaps\u00a0best known in New York for his monumental self-destroying sculpture\u00a0Homage to New York, presented for only one evening in March of 1960 in the sculpture garden at MoMA.<\/p> <p>The earliest work on view in the show will be\u00a0Tinguely\u2019s\u00a0Meta-Malevich\u00a0relief from 1954, whose\u00a0title references\u00a0constructivist compositions.

The works deal with the power of artistic gesture. Each work has a blue glass gazing ball that sits on a painted aluminum shelf attached to the front of the painting. The viewer and the painting are reflected in the gazing ball. This metaphysical occurrence connects the viewer to a family of cultural history in real time. Through the simple act of placing a gazing ball in front of the images, painting and sculpture are reunited for maximum sensory perception, as in ancient times.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/e\/1\/600_444114241.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>15th Stop: JONATHAN LeVINE GALLERY (529 W 20th St) presents: MARTIN WHITTFOOTH, OFFERINGS<\/p> <p><br\/>In Wittfooth\u2019s allegorical narratives, animals roam a dystopian world void of human life with the remnants of industrialized society in a state of devastation. Fires rage and oceans surge but despite the destruction, his creatures radiate and evoke a sentiment of oneness. Where they exist life flourishes and the animals in this sense are the life-givers.<\/p> <p>The works in\u00a0Offering\u00a0explore the theme of shamanism and its current revitalization around the world. Wittfooth delves into the notion that the rediscovery of shamanistic practices, such as reaching an altered state of consciousness, is peeling away our egos and materialistic obsessions and encouraging a connection with nature and to each other.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/d\/600_444114781.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>16th stop: \u00a0MICHAEL ROSENFELD GALLERY [masked]th Ave @ 19th St) presents:\u00a0METAL: American Sculpture,[masked]<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/e\/d\/600_444115533.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>FEE: $5.00<\/b> payabale in cash or VENMO to your tour guide Joey<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Full paid members: FREE<\/b><\/p> <p><b>After the event, we'll grab beers\/wine and burgers (veggie options too!) at NY BURGER CO. on 23rd\/10th<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GuySocialNyc\/events\/226533441\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":14400000,"name":"GUY GALLERY WALK: NOVEMBER 2015","id":"226533441","time":1447527600000,"updated":1447542836000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383018152000,"name":"GUY SOCIAL NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10885132,"urlname":"GuySocialNyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"GUYS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11226","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"1616 Caton Ave","address_2":"Coney Island Ave between Caton & Parkside Avenues","lon":-73.964798,"phone":"(718) 965-8973 ","name":"Prospect Park Parade Grounds","id":832326,"state":"NY","lat":40.650828,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":6.99254369736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":7,"created":1415465910000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Meet on the american football field (near the entrance close to the public restrooms)!!!<\/b><\/p> <p>The game is scheduled to start at 2:00.

In a nutshell, this shoot will go through the stages of setting up a model shoot, shooting and processing. We'll go from positioning lights, metering, model rapport, shooting a model, time management and then we'll do some post processing on the current shoot.<\/p> <p><b>Objective:<\/b><\/p> <p>During our bigger group shoots, lighting and metering is usually done beforehand. This shoot will go into the Why's, How's and methodology when setting up a \"set\". Lighting and Metering will be explained with actual application during our shoot. As this shoot will be limited to a small group, there will be more time to shoot a model but we'll use that time to work on rapport, time management and visualizing a concept with the model to get the shots you need to get a full set from a look. During the post processing portion, we will take some of the shots from the shoot and go through some simple preliminary adjustments onto some of the common issue we can solve when doing a studio shoot. (Example: background extension, seamless background crease smoothing, adding catch lights, color correcting, erasing tags, skin smoothing, dodge\/burn usage, etc.) These issues will be relevant only to the looks we just shot so it's an actual application of solutions to a shoot we can all go back and practice on. (Because we all have different cameras and sensors, there will be unique issues to solve and you'll be presented with a more personalized solution.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>Stephanie is an amazing model who has become one of our member favorites over the few months she has been at the studio. She gives her all and we always get amazing photos with her. We planned out 3 glamour looks to shoot, including lingerie, sporty sexy and an edgier look. With these looks we will shoot high key, 3 light setup and either an outdoor or natural light\/constant light mix. (Weather permitting)<\/p> <p>The first two hours will be the actual shoot. We will take a half hour break for any one on one time with Stephanie and for a snack break before starting the post processing portion. (This will also give me and any photographer that brings a laptop a chance to prep the photos from the shoot earlier that we will work on.) Feel free to bring your laptops to follow along. If you are on a Mac, bring a flash drive and I can copy over any actions that may be of help from the processing workflow.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>RSVP\/Cost:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Please take a look\/adhere to the <b>Signup<\/b> info below in the Disclaimers section as this will be enforced.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p>(Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge)<\/p> <p>(Non-Commercial Release provided onsite or PDF version to email registered upon check-in.)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Model:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stephanie Dec:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelmayhem.com\/1557988\">MM#[masked]<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Photos provided by model for promotional purposes only.

This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/226513016\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"Model & Workflow Series with Stephanie Dec - Nov. 14th","id":"226513016","time":1447527600000,"updated":1447614775000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07043","country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"274 Bellevue Ave","name":"Anderson Park","lon":-74.209946,"id":14603352,"state":"NJ","lat":40.841488,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.1535930634,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444782404000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Basic Ground Rules for Participation<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Please wear either a blue\/black or white shirt to make things easy (Preferably bring both in case we need to mix the teams more evenly).<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>no need to respond at all if you can't\/don't want to play<\/p> <p>\u2022 if you do respond IN, please come unless something really urgent comes up (hangovers or better offers from your cooler friends not accepted for absences!)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 If you suck at Ultimate... you are more than welcome.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee. You do not need to be an expert frisbee player\/thrower etc. - it's all about having fun.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Fit-Club\/events\/226301857\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":9000000,"name":"NEW TIME - Saturday Ultimate Frisbee (Anderson Park)","id":"zffmllytpbsb","time":1447527600000,"updated":1447537951000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1393688588000,"name":"North Jersey Fit Club","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":13120942,"urlname":"North-Jersey-Fit-Club","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10002","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"East River Promenade","name":"Lower East Side Ecology Center","lon":-73.973877,"id":15369962,"state":"NY","lat":40.717758,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.38705849648,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446433353000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NYC Safe Energy Campaign presents an exciting and thought provoking afternoon:<\/p> <p>Come to listen, to talk.

Participants sit in circle in deep meditation, aligning with the profound healing energy created by the temple, Himalayan bowl sounds and the crystal grid. Suzy creates a crystal grid and calibrates a special frequency with various minerals from all over the world to support deep miracle healing. She accesses the Universal Infinite Field to provide quantum healing to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels of all participants. Folks are required to sign a release form and list any ailments they would like to address during the session. Each participant is guided by assistants to the center of the circle and lays upon the crystal gridded table to receive psychic surgery.\u00a0 Suzy works, as guided and needed by the individual, to trigger the participants internal system into high frequency alignment. This spurs the body to return to health and peaceful well being, as the original root cause has been redirected from the energetic base point. During the entire time Suzy is working on people individually doing hands on healing and making adjustments within the core matrix, as well as holding the temple energies for the Master Teachers; she is using various sound tools,bowls, Peruvian whistles, rattles, as well as using some essential oils and pure sage or palo santo. It is important to understand that participants are not receiving any external energies, but are being triggered or activated to turbo boost and enhance their own energetic field and expanded consciousness.Crystals charged with the Divine Light Healing energy will also be for sale, as well as Suzy\u2019s CDs and book.Pre-registration is required as there is limited room &amp; there is a three day recommended protocol for all Healing Temple participants.

The apocalypse begins in an underground top secret prison system, where inmates and staff infected with a deadly infectious virus terrorize the living. Over the course of about 45 minutes, you will be briefed, trained and thrust into the Apocalypse, where you must face down the infected, re-arm yourself and interact with any known survivors. NYZ Apocalypse is a frightening experience, and we therefore only recommend those 16\u00a0years or older to enter.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>THE EXPERIENCE<\/b><\/p> <p>NYZ Apocalypse is an interactive live-action theatrical production, where you decide your fate. Equipped with gas recoil laser weapons, your group will enter the Apollo Prison System and fight back hundreds of zombies. At NYZ, you can only survive the Apocalypse by working as a team. Make sure the zombies don't get close enough to \"infect\" you, and be sure to interact with the guards and personel inside the prison network to reload your weapons.\u00a0From the moment you arrive at NYZ, you will be a part of the story. For a totally immersive and truly memorable experience, leave your ego at the door.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>THE WEAPONS<\/b><\/p> <p>At NYZ Apocalypse, you will be equipped with a full weight laser rifle. Utilizing a unique gas-recoil system, these weapons fire an infrared laser beam accurate up to 500 yards. Nothing but a harmless beam of light is fired form these guns, and no form of protective gear is required. Conserving your shots, reloading and finding spare ammunition will all be necessary throughout the Apollo Prison System.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/e\/1\/600_443579361.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Date:<\/b> November 14th\u00a0Saturday;\u00a0please arrive 15 minutes earlier.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Depart 3:45 PM:<\/b>\u00a0(Garden City Deli) Corner of 43rd St and 9th Ave New York, NY 10036 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/preview#!q=Corner+of+43rd+St+and+9th+Ave+New+York%2C+NY+10036&amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d4155!2d[masked]!3d[masked]!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x89c[masked]eb%3A0x7d4d72b0aebac932!3m8!1m3!1d387191!2d[masked]!3d[masked]!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1\">Map<\/a>)<\/p> <p><b>Depart 4:30 PM:<\/b>\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.starwoodhotels.com%2Fsheraton%2Fproperty%2Foverview%2Findex.html%3FpropertyID%3D994&amp;ei=nmFfU7KUD7S_sQTAsYHoCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1YqikApAEZ24ooJL-Mpsbhyflhw&amp;sig2=KDswUoYz8OQjL6XWrfrBMw&amp;bvm=bv.65397613,d.cWc\">Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel<\/a>)\u00a0[masked]th Ave, Flushing, NY 11354 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/preview?q=135-20+39th+Ave,+Flushing,+NY+11354&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c2600e3f6030e1:0xec43cdca2dc401b8,135-20+39th+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11354&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=nmFfU7KUD7S_sQTAsYHoCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ8gEwAQ\">Map<\/a>).<\/p> <p><b>Return:\u00a0<\/b>Depart from NYZ after dinner at 8:30 PM and get back to Flushing at around 9:30 PM &amp; Manhattan 10:00 PM.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b>\u00a0Early birds $59 for first 8 spots or 10 days in advance; afterward Regular $69.<\/p> <p><b>Trip includes:<\/b>\u00a0Round trip Benz Sprinter van transportation from NYC, Extermination Package &amp; service fee.<\/p> <p><b>Buy Ticket Here:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nov2015nyzapocalypse.eventbrite.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nov2015nyzapocalypse.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nov2015nyzapocalypse.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0or you can Chase Quickpay me the amount indicated above to\u00a0[masked] to avoid transaction fee\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAYS\/pages\/How_to_Use_Chase_Quickpay\/\">How to Use Chase Quickpay?<\/a>) If Quickpaying, please indicate your boarding location.\u00a0Your spot is NOT confirmed until your payment is received.<\/p> <p><b>Maximum:<\/b>\u00a015<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/e\/b\/600_443579371.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Refund Policy:<\/b><br\/>* Full refund minus $10 processing fee if cancelled 14 days in advance;<br\/>* 50% refund if cancelled 7 days in advance;<br\/>* Afterward, no refund for cancellation or no show; however, you can transfer your spot to other with $10 transfer fee.<br\/>* 100% refund if the trip is cancelled due to bad weather or vendor close down.<\/p> <p>By RSVPing \"Yes\", you and your guest(s) are accepting the terms to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAYS\/pages\/WAIVER_AND_RELEASE_OF_LIABILITY\/\">the Waiver &amp; Release of Liability<\/a>\u00a0set forth by NYC Active Young Singles.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/8\/a\/600_443579530.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAYS\/events\/226383809\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":22500000,"name":"NYZ Apocalypse: Zombie Survival Experience + Transport","id":"226383809","time":1447533900000,"updated":1447715600000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1259482887000,"name":"NYC Active Young Singles","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1563072,"urlname":"NYCAYS","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Active Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1 east 97th street","name":"Central Park Entrance ","lon":-73.955162,"id":22158912,"state":"NY","lat":40.788586,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":34,"headcount":0,"distance":3.23605012894,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441389765000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone!<\/p> <p>Please be there 15 minutes earlier so you can get set up.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

The dinners\u00a0 are often themed and include both casual and fancy options, with a wide range of prices.\u00a0 Some examples include a wine tasting event, a poker night, a sunset dinner on the river, or an evening of high-cuisine from France or Italy. The best part of these dinners is that they provide more opportunities throughout the year to socialize with CUUC friends, old and new. Not sure how to bid?

Is this tool useful for brownstoners, community gardeners, and suburbanites, or can it be scaled up to service an entire city? Could this get us off fracked gas that may have radon contamination? Could this help manage one of New York's biggest problems during rainstorms and floods: combined sewer overflows? Would finding a sustainable use for food waste reduce the city's landfill and rat problems? But how does Biogas compare with methane for global warming potential?

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/225978477\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"duration":9000000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Saddhasara!","id":"cltxklytpbkb","time":1447542000000,"updated":1447571672000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"18 East 33rd Street (Between 5th and Madison)","name":"Nelly Spillane's Pub","lon":-73.949211,"id":14318302,"state":"NY","lat":40.605625,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.2226810455,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446664624000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you are wondering why the Smutty Book Club is posting a meetup to watch UFC, the answer is: hot sweaty guys rolling around a floor for four hours.

This show may sell out, so we encourage you to purchase tickets online in advance.<\/b> Also, for this performance, while there is a large seating area and most people will be seated, there will also be some standing room. If you want to guarantee yourself a seat (as opposed to standing room), you should arrive when the doors open at 7:00pm. Sonic Escape's performance will start at 7:30pm.

Atkins initially became an avid horror film fan in his childhood days; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0001328?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Howard Hawks<\/a>\u2018 immortal classic <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0044121?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Thing from Another World<\/a> (1951) made an especially strong impression on him as a kid. Tom attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and was a member of the Gamma Phi Fraternity. Atkins made his film debut as a rookie police officer in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000069?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Frank Sinatra<\/a> private eye-outing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0062883?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Detective<\/a> (1968); it was the first of many police officer roles he has played throughout the years. Tom appeared in two films for director <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000118?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">John Carpenter<\/a>: he is very likable as Nick Castle in the spooky ghost film <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0080749?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">The Fog<\/a> (1980) and solid as Rehme in the fantastic futuristic sci-fi\/action cult film <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0082340?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Escape from New York<\/a> (1981). Atkins had a nice small role as a disapproving and overbearing father in the wrap-around segments of the immensely enjoyable fright feature anthology <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083767?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Creepshow<\/a> (1982). He made for a touchingly flawed hero as Dr. Daniel Challis in the unjustly maligned\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0085636?ref_=nmbio_mbio\">Halloween III: Season of the Witch<\/a> (1982).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram #10 in the ELEKTRA THEATER<\/p> <p>Shorts:<\/p> <p>FIRST NIGHT IN THE NEW HOUSE \u2026\u2026\u2026.5\u00a0MINS\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Dir.

Came on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant is on the second floor. Came in and impressed at the ambiance. Very nice. It wasn't too full so we were seated right away.<\/p> <p>Intended to order apps, drinks, and entree. Got their coconut mojitos! Oh my! Yum! Ask for Waldo to make it! You won't regret it. If you enjoy coconut, you will be pleased with the ratio of taste and alcohol of this drink. Plus they don't jip you in any liquid. They fill your glass to the brim.<\/p> <p>Got an order of the shrimp and garlic and grilled octopus. Again, was so pleased. They also give you bread along with their olive paste. At first I was reluctant to try it but we ended up getting seconds!<\/p> <p>The place was nice enough to have us bring our drinks and go sit outside and enjoy the evening and drinks. Was there with my friend from 7-12! Haha.<\/p> <p>Great place, service, and food! Will definitely come back!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Over-40-Singles-in-New-Jersey\/events\/226073321\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Mojito Lounge & Restaurant","id":"226073321","time":1447549200000,"updated":1447711644000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1279388798000,"name":"Over 40 Fun Loving Singles in New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1999969482,"id":1676837,"urlname":"Over-40-Singles-in-New-Jersey","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Fun Loving Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"230 5th Ave. ","name":"230 5th Ave. Penthouse","lon":-73.987892,"id":18663172,"state":"NY","lat":40.743961,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.432575434446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446218619000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join 300+ professional singles at\u00a0Manhattan's largest and most spectacular penthouse lounge, 230 Fifth, which is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows with breathtaking panoramic views of the NYC skyline.\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/3\/c\/600_443539516.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>What to expect:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Free Light Appetizers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a02 for 1 Drinks (8-9pm)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Ice Breakers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0DJ &amp; Dancing<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Giveaways<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 300+ singles\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>1st 15 tickets are just $15 with discount code \"15\" at checkout -\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/bash\/dates\/Nov-14-2015_at_0800PM\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/bash\/dates\/Nov-14-2015_at_0800PM\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/bash\/dates\/Nov-14-2015_at_0800PM<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>$20 after that online w\/ RSVP,\u00a0$30 at the door \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/8\/a\/600_438828010.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>What's the venue like?\u00a0230 Fifth was voted #1 by Citysearch for Best New Bars\/Lounges in New York City\u00a0Voted ,#2 Best New Bar\/Lounge in the United States by Citysearch, and voted #1 \"To Do\" in New York by Spur<\/p> <p><i>Is this event private?\u00a0<\/i><i>The entire venue will be 100% private for our party.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226605064\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpbtb","time":1447596000000,"updated":1447608540000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"West Street and North Moore","name":"Pier 25","lon":-74.012032,"id":1576885,"state":"NY","lat":40.720306,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":2.35855054855,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445950312000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This event is proudly brought to you by Soccer Beyond!<\/b><\/p> <p>Learn more on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/soccerbeyond.com\">SoccerBeyond.com<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond\">Facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Details\u00a0-\u00a0<i>Fun, interactive, effective.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>90min.

In\u00a0Missing Microbes, Dr. Martin Blaser invites us into the wilds of the human microbiome where for hundreds of thousands of years bacterial and human cells have existed in a peaceful symbiosis that is responsible for the health and equilibrium of our body.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

This fascia restriction can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention. \u00a0In addition, increased respiratory control and focus have been reported by students.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian\/chakras pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is emphasized to sensations in the body that are grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into vigorous strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

It's roughly a 15-minute walk--but unlike street parking near the subway, it's guaranteed.<\/p> <p>Option 2: The elevated train station and pedestrian bridge are located near the intersection of Westchester Ave. and Amendola Place; if you get near there and can't find it, ask anyone in the neighborhood; they should know. Try parking on the street nearby, then climb the stairs to the subway station (no fare required) and walk across the bridge.

When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the \u201cungettable\u201d Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn\u2019t wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, This Side of Paradise, to Scribner\u2019s, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and take the rest as it comes.<\/p> <p>What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined attention and success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Everyone wants to meet the dashing young author of the scandalous novel\u2014and his witty, perhaps even more scandalous wife. Zelda bobs her hair, adopts daring new fashions, and revels in this wild new world. Each place they go becomes a playground: New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera\u2014where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein.<\/p> <p>Everything seems new and possible. Troubles, at first, seem to fade like morning mist. But not even Jay Gatsby\u2019s parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous\u2014sometimes infamous\u2014husband? How can she forge her own identity while fighting her demons and Scott\u2019s, too? With brilliant insight and imagination, Therese Anne Fowler brings us Zelda\u2019s irresistible story as she herself might have told it.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-20-something-book-club\/events\/224199404\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":7200000,"name":"\"Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald,\" by Therese Anne Fowler","id":"224199404","time":1447614000000,"updated":1447623518000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294365470000,"name":"20\/30 something book club","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":1760874,"urlname":"NYC-20-something-book-club","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446959401000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hyatt Place is a new hotel in downtown Flushing, located just a block away from the Main St. stop of the 7 train.\u00a0 It is also accessible via every bus line that goes though Flushing (Q20, Q44, Q25, Q34, Q27, Q17, Q65, Q48, Q13, Q28, Q16, Q58, Q12, Q66, Q19, Q50, Q15, Q26).<\/p> <p>The evening's focus will be on \"older,\" \"more popular\" games (such as Catan, Carcassonne, Dominion, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, Power Grid, etc.) so that newer players can get a solid introduction to these new styles of board games.

EFT is a simple yet incredibly effective method of self healing that can be used to immediately reduce anxiety, stress, and other emotions that stand in our way of living in a place of optimum well-being and personal peace. Together we will do lots of EFT tapping to work on individual and collective issues of concern. The more of us who tap together in a group format, the more benefit can be received by all.<\/p> <p>At this meetup we will continue exploring the nature of our mind and emotions and learn how to identify \u2018stories\u2019 we tell about ourselves that contribute to any sense of personal 'Not-OKness'. Then we can release the charge these stories carry with EFT and increase our personal Emotional Freedom!<\/p> <p><br\/>One of the special features of our Meetup is that we demonstrate how we have unconscious blocks to happiness and Emotional Freedom. Using Energetic Rescripting Process (ERP), a technique that borrows from Kinesiology and EFT, we locate the nature of these blocks and remove them.<\/p> <p><br\/>Even from the demos we do in our Meetups\u00a0people get back to me with\u00a0remarkable stories of how things in their life are shifting\u00a0for the better!<\/p> <p><br\/>Registration for this meeting is requested but not required.

O\u2019Hara (producer of Fahrenheit 9\/11, Bowling for Columbine and Sicko). This is a daring and intimate film that seeks to change the way we think about cancer. O\u2019Hara investigates the connection between the current cancer epidemic and our western lifestyle, including medical professionals\u2019 tendency to treat only the symptoms and not the underlying causes of what ails us. Backed by personal experiences and the scientific validation of Dr. David Servan-Schreiber, O\u2019Hara asks us to reconsider the way we currently treat cancer, advocates for society-wide lifestyle changes, and tackles the institutions that stand in the way of those important changes. Narrated by Academy Award\u00ae winner Morgan Freeman, The C Word challenges us to step up and take control of our health.<\/p> <p>Note: This event is not a typical H2NYC event. \u00a0It is essentially a way to gather folks interested in healthcare innovation and wellness to meet after the film at set a time and place, not a structured event like we usually do.<\/p> <p>Enjoy!<\/p> <p>Alex, Anthony, &amp; Mimi<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8g4gx_dnLUc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8g4gx_dnLUc<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll walk over the Client Cab Co. after the screening, see you soon! -Nate","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/health20nyc\/events\/226672705\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"The C Word Screening Unofficial After Party","id":"226672705","time":1447713000000,"updated":1447724877000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213055419000,"name":"Health 2.0 NYC - The New York Healthcare Innovation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1183598,"urlname":"health20nyc","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Healthcare Innovators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"521 W. 126th Street","name":"St. Mary's Episcopal Church\u2014Rectory Commons Room","lon":-73.956032,"id":24198032,"state":"NY","lat":40.81493,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.83506250381,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447013091000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A weekly Meditation Group in the Zen Tradition.

How do we use data to make people feel? How do we explain the big picture from millions of tiny details?

Virtual Reality is positioning itself as an 'empathy engine' to help people connect with data on a visceral level. In our social media saturated cosmopolitan environment, we are told crude stories about how a million people shared a moment in 140 characters or less.

It is based on the belief that we have two thoughts systems, one based on fear and separation from the Divine and another one based on love and oneness with the Divine. The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.
