Some people consider this area as the best trail system in the Adirondacks in regard to appealing destinations, trail maintenance, and design.<\/b> Since a lot of people have asked about backpacking trips, we decided to do a beginner backpacking trip to Pharaoh Lake with the option to do day hikes, explore the area, camp and chill. This is a great place to rest, have lunch, and go swimming. Pharaoh Lake is breathtaking with its 100 foot depth, irregular shoreline, numerous islands, and unspoiled wilderness surrounding it.<\/p> <p><b>TRIP DETAILS:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a beginner packpacking trip\u00a0and will involve an easy\u00a04.5 mile hike to our\u00a0camp at Pharaoh Lake.<\/b> After settling in, people will have the option of doing several hikes in the area, Fishing,\u00a0BBQ'ing\u00a0or\u00a0just hanging out near the lake.\u00a0During the day, we can chillax at the lake or hike up Pharaoh mountain.

Director Lucio Fulci's splatterific follow-up to ZOMBIE is a mad assemblage of nightmarish vignettes oozing with atmosphere, supernatural presence and pustulant, walking corpses. Starring Christopher George, Catriona MacColl, Giovanni Lombardo Radice and Fabio Frizzi's fabulous score.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6tGLr_HnMec\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/6tGLr_HnMec<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burial_Ground_%28film%29\">BURIAL GROUND<\/a> (1981)<\/b><\/i>- Love it or really love it, this is a movie that you will remember for the rest of your natural days -- and quite possibly should you ever dig your way out of the grave. This fan favorite has everything a rabid gore-hound can ask for (and more), and nothing resembling smart characters, plot or budget to get in the way of all the insane, bloody zombie carnage. There's also Peter Bark.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nB3jpozGjhk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/nB3jpozGjhk<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0082815\/\">NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES<\/a> (1980)<\/b><\/i>- Could this incredible night of Italian zombie gut-munchers get any crazier? Answer: yes, it certainly can. Here's director Bruno (RATS: NIGHTS OF TERROR) Mattei's and screenwriter Claudio (TROLL 2) Fragasso's chomp at DAWN OF THE DEAD.

Of course they may inadvertently turn you into a brain-eating creature of the undead, and you'll go chasing your friends around the local mortuary, but at least somewhere in what's left of your mind you'll know zombies exist. Dan O' Bannon's ghoulishly awesome punk zombie romp returns with all the music by THE CRAMPS, TSOL and THE DAMNED you crave, kiddies.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/347aL0NqWFU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/347aL0NqWFU<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Children_%281980_film%29\">THE CHILDREN<\/a> (1980)<\/b><\/i>- A bus full of innocent school kids passes through a cloud of nuclear radiation turning them all into little creeps with black fingernails who can kill with a touch. Watch out mom and dad! A bizarre, irreverent, spooky, fun treat. Harry Manfredini supplies the score that sounds a lot like his FRIDAY THE 13TH music.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ssva3IdZ1jI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/ssva3IdZ1jI<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0067630\/\">THE DEATH WHEELERS<\/a> [aka.

Directed by Don (KISS OF THE VAMPIRES) Sharp, this film is a pure exploitation kitsch delight.

A non-stop, phantasmagorical assault of violent set-pieces, overblown bloodshed and eerie gothic strangeness centered around an old hotel built over a doorway to eternal damnation; confidently produced on a small budget and hauntingly scored.

Effective early effects work by Tom Savini and a sound cast including John Marley, Lynn Carlin and Richard Backus make this low-budget shocker a true gem of '70's horror.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LCtBPG-t5-Q\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/LCtBPG-t5-Q<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shock_Waves_%28film%29\">SHOCK WAVES<\/a> (1977)<\/b><\/i>- The most striking underwater Nazi zombies (goggled, covered in yuck) you'll ever see stalk a group of unlucky vacationers (including THE DEAD ZONE's Brooke Adams) on a godforsaken island inhabited only by Peter Cushing's crazed SS Commander.

Unfortunately this will not be reserved seating, so we are back to the prehistoric age of having to line up in advance to get good seats. The movie starts at 6:55 and they usually let people in a half an hour prior. For big movies like this, there is usually a place for people to line up before the theater opens. Considering how many we are and the fact that this is opening weekend, I highly recommend that everyone get there at six (or the closest to it that you can) so we all have the best chance of sitting together in good seats. Of course, we will try to reserve seats for everyone when we enter the theater, but it is unlikely that we will be able to do this for this many people. <b>Let's all meet at 6:00 p.m. in the line<\/b> (just ask the theater staff where that would be, as it varies).

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/231422998\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Friday Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"231422998","time":1464386400000,"updated":1464400380000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Paramus","address_1":"between Rt 17 North and from road.(Just of the GSP)","name":"Paramus Park Mall food court","lon":-74.075417,"id":6902942,"state":"NJ","lat":40.944542,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.1924009323,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1366635023000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's get together and trade some Disney pins!!

Please note, if it's your FIRST time, it's mandatory to do the day time in order to do the night time as well.<\/p> <p>NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY, the only thing is You CANNOT be AFRAID of heights!!<\/p> <p>Personal Experience: For me this was An AMAZING experience. It was intense but I'm an adrenaline junkie, this is right up my alley.<\/p> <p>This is a guided tour with all equipment provided: harness, helmet, caribiners etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/6\/b\/600_449189291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/7\/d\/600_449189309.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Definition: Via ferrata (Italian for \"iron road\", plural vie ferrate or in English via ferratas) is a protected climbing route. The essence of a modern via ferrata is a steel cable which runs along the route and is periodically (every 3 to 10 metres (9.8 to 32.8 ft) fixed to the rock. Using a via ferrata kit, climbers can secure themselves to the cable, limiting any fall. The cable can also be used as aid to climbing, and additional climbing aids, such as iron rungs (stemples), pegs, carved steps and even ladders and bridges are often provided. They offer the relatively inexperienced a means of enjoying dramatic positions and accessing difficult peaks, normally the preserve of the serious mountaineer; although, as there is a need for a good head for heights and basic technique, the via ferrata can be seen as a distinct step up from ordinary mountain walking.<\/p> <p>Location: Located in the Potomac Highlands region near Circleville, WV<\/p> <p>Distance: from NY it's estimated about 7hour drive without stops.<\/p> <p>Description and details: The Via Ferrata is a one of a kind adventure experience, offering a mile of fixed-anchor, professionally-guided rock climbing. During this 3.5-5 hour climb you\u2019ll gain 1085 feet in elevation, cross a suspension bridge that is 150 feet high and 200 feet long, and reach exposed heights of 280 feet. All you need for this day on the rocks is some physical ability, an appreciation of the outdoors, and of course a desire to have a great day outside! The double-fin rocks provide the unique combination of physical challenge and overwhelming beauty.<br\/>Italian for \u2018by way of iron\u2019, the Via Ferrata is a permanently installed system of steel rungs and cables that allows you to climb up and over two towering rock fins. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth the effort.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/8\/1\/600_449189313.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Climb Duration<\/p> <p>3.5 \u2013 5 hours depending on group size and ability.<\/p> <p>Difficulty Level<br\/>It\u2018s difficult to compare the Via Ferrata experience to anything else. It can be very demanding or not so demanding depending on one\u2019s level of fitness. It can also be emotionally taxing depending on one\u2019s level of comfort with heights. It is not recommended for those who are trying to overcome an intense fear of heights.<\/p> <p>How high do we actually go?<br\/>All Via Ferrata climbers will experience heights of approximately 200 feet! The most adventurous climbers can take the extra challenge of completing the Head Wall, an additional 100 feet of vertical climbing.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/8\/6\/600_449189318.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>What to Wear<br\/>Dress in layers so you can make adjustments as you warm up and cool down.<br\/>You should dress for movement and according to the weather. The temperature tends to be about 10\u00b0F cooler in the mountains, and may be even cooler due to wind. In general wear comfy, loose-fitting clothing that does not restrict your movement. Short shorts are not recommended and many climbers prefer to wear pants or capris to keep their knees covered.<br\/>Footwear<br\/>Sturdy athletic shoes or lightweight hiking shoes\/boots. No sandals (including Chacos or Tevas), or FiveFingers shoes.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/9\/2\/600_449189330.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bring with You<br\/>Waivers, small daypack, 2-quarts of water, trail snacks, sunscreen, camera\/GoPro (optional, must be secured), rain gear (if necessary), fingerless bicycle style gloves (recommended).<\/p> <p>Can I bring my own gear \/ Can I get a discount for bringing my own gear?<br\/>You can bring a GoPro or camera and we can provide a helmet with a GoPro mount on it.

Farmers are paid by the government to deliberately dump their crops and allow them to rot in fields. Supermarkets throw out perfectly good food on a daily basis into dumpsters, much of it not in biodegradable containers to be brought to landfills.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile in 2014 there were 48.1 million people living in food insecure households, 16.2 million of them were children. Why is this happening in the richest nation in the world? And more importantly, what are our personal and collective roles in ending it? Filmmakers and food lovers, Jen and Grant dive into the issue of food waste from farm and retail, right to the back of their own fridge. In a deliciously entertaining challenge, they pledge to quit grocery shopping and survive only on discarded food.<\/p> <p>Join us for this informative and compelling film. There will be a discussion and refreshments after the film.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/2\/8\/600_450109448.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Unitarian-Universalist-Congregation-of-the-Palisades\/events\/231194819\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"\"JUST EAT IT\" Documentary","id":"231194819","time":1464391800000,"updated":1464404134000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391130728000,"name":"Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Palisades","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":12619942,"urlname":"Unitarian-Universalist-Congregation-of-the-Palisades","group_lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"326 6th St (btw. 4th and 5th Ave.) ","lon":-73.988304,"phone":"347-613-0988","name":"Postmark Cafe","id":1473596,"state":"NY","lat":40.666771,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.76300668716,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438023652000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come make yourself at home at this unique comedy show and watch today's brightest comedy stars shine.

Since then, The Fried Bananas have traveled the country with a single mission \u2013 to swing harder than a 5-year-old at recess and, more importantly, to make people dance!<\/p> <p><i>NEXT MONTH'S LIVE BAND:<\/i><br\/>June 24th will feature Jessy Carolina and the Hot Mess.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses,Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses,Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses, Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p>","why":"It's a great way to start your Saturday!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/231314756\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Saturday Ultimate @ 10AM - Morningside Park","id":"rcpmklyvhblc","time":1464444000000,"updated":1464457090000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"89 E 42nd St","name":"The Information Booth at Grand Central","lon":-73.977303,"id":24225466,"state":"NY","lat":40.752495,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.687959551811,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456167578000,"rating":{"count":9,"average":4.88999986649},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>One hour from NYC on the Hudson line of the Metro North RR is the town of Cold Springs.

We move the body through the classical poses very slowly, gently and conscientiously. Rests are taken between poses as the body moves towards inner introspection on a physical and meditative level. This class is highly beneficial for those returning from an illness or injury, or who haven\u2019t moved in a long time. It is recommended for those who are looking for a gentle class.

The practice is appropriate for students of all levels, from beginner to lifelong practitioners and accessible to so many because it meets each student where they are and according to their condition. As students move through the different series, they are encouraged to go deeper and experience the practice in a meditative and spiritual way. Sri Dharma\u2019s passion for helping students go deeper in their practice using only the best and most efficient techniques with the ultimate goal of Self-realization (gaining absolute knowledge of the True Self) is reflected in all aspects of the Dharma Yoga system.<\/p> <p>Dharma Yoga has roots in all nine forms of yoga, including Hatha, Raja, Karma, Kriya, Bhakti, Japa, Laya and Jnana, as well as a focus on the Eight Limbs of Yoga (Patanjali\u2019s Ashtanga Yoga) with great emphasis placed on Yama and Niyama. Sri Dharma was given an extraordinary gift of knowledge in receiving yoga directly from his Guru, Sri Swami Kailashananda a.k.a. Yogi Gupta, for over a decade beginning in the early 1960\u2032s. During this period of intense study, Sri Dharma was exposed to various yoga techniques that he has refined over an almost half century of practice and teaching into the Dharma Yoga he and his certified teachers the world over continue to share with their students each day.<\/p> <p>In essence, Dharma Yoga is a system of classical Hatha-Raja Yoga. A devotional practice that emphasizes good health, a clear mind and a kind heart. The method weaves together many teachings in order to bring all students closer to the goal of Self-realization.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Hudson-Park-Yoga\/events\/231116192\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":5400000,"name":"North Hudson Park Yoga: SATURDAY Noon Dharma Gentle  12pm-1:30pm!","id":"pdljtlyvhblc","time":1464451200000,"updated":1464458760000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1463179543000,"name":"North Hudson Park Yoga Community","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":19949946,"urlname":"North-Hudson-Park-Yoga","group_lat":40.8300018311,"who":"Yoga Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"5th Ave & 4th St","name":"Washington Square Park","lon":-73.983768,"id":726474,"state":"NY","lat":40.672186,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.39746999741,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1464400628000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come meet Club Fearless Club Mascot \"Neyko\" a 10 foot long Burmese Albino Python (who was just fed today).

For lunchtime, bring a blanket or something to sit on the grass because there are not many benches or rocks to sit on around the estate. There also is no place to buy lunch at the Lyndhurst Estate. After we eat lunch, we'll explore the beautiful grounds of the Lyndhurst Estate. <b>The lovely Rose Garden should be in full bloom.<\/b><\/p> <p>Afterwards, we'll go past Villa Lewaro, which\u00a0is a sumptuous 34-room white stucco mansion with a red tile roof. This paliatial mansion was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.<\/p> <p>Finally, we'll walk past the Armour-Stiner House, also known as the Octagon House, which is a unique octagon-shaped and domed Victorian style house. This house is also a National Historic Landmark.<\/p> <p>We'll occasionally\u00a0be walking on the Old Croton Aqueduct (a wide dirt trail), which will connect us to\u00a0historic mansions\/houses, but we'll mostly be walking on paved trails or sidewalks.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Time:<\/b>\u00a0The meeting\u00a0time is <i><b>(before lunch)<\/b><\/i> at <b>12:15 PM. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Place:<\/b> The meeting place is\u00a0<b>outside of the entrance to the Red Barn Bakery at 4 South Astor Street, Irvington, NY 10533. <\/b>The Red Barn Bakery is at the southern end\u00a0of the Irvington Metro-North train station. <b>(If the train is late, the organizer will wait for the late-arriving train.)<\/b><\/p> <p>Before the walk, restrooms are available in the Red Barn Bakery.

The forest's placement makes it an ideal base from which to explore the Cape's many attractions. From here you're minutes away from the quaint seashore town of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandwichchamber.com\/what-to-do.php\">Sandwich <\/a>where you can explore its shops and museums.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Or if outdoor activities are your thing, admission to\u00a0Scusset Beach is included for campers or you can spend a few hours biking down the banks of the nearby Cape Cod Canal. There are also 10 miles of hiking trails in the forest if walking is your thing. For the truly daring, spend a few hours testing your acrobatic skills--we're just down the road from\u00a0the <a href=\"http:\/\/heritageadventurepark.org\/\">Adventure Park in Heritage<\/a> with it's treetop aerial trails and ziplines.<\/p> <p><b>The Plan ...<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll arrive Saturday afternoon at the campground office to check in and head to our camp area to set up our tents and other gear. From here we can do as much or as little as we'd like. In the evening we'll cook and have a communal meal over an open fire, and spend the rest of the night doing the usual camping activities -- partaking in adult beverages and stuffing our faces with snacks, playing games, and shooting the breeze.<\/p> <p>Sunday we'll get up and make breakfast, then the day is ours to play as we wish. In the evening we'll do more campfire cooking, socializing, and merry making until we nod off.<\/p> <p>Monday we awake to enjoy out last meal together, break down our campsites, then head home.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost ...<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$18.75 per person, click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=E7FX4YALWLNAU\">HERE<\/a> to\u00a0pay.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Cost is for <b>TWO<\/b> nights of camping, checking out on Monday. You don't have to stay two nights but that is what you're paying for. Payment is via PayPal -- you don't need a PayPal account and can pay via credit\/debit card.<\/p> <p><b><i>Space is limited so until I receive your payment your RSVP is not confirmed and your attendance is not guaranteed. Once I have confirmation of receipt of your payment I will move you to confirmed RSVP status.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Refunds will be given only if the meetup is cancelled or rescheduled.<\/p> <p><b>Food Plan ...<\/b><\/p> <p>To keep it simple, everyone is responsible for bringing what they would like to eat and drink. We will be cooking dinner Saturday; breakfast\u00a0 and dinner Sunday; and breakfast Monday and it will be semi-communal, meaning bring what you would like to eat for yourself but perhaps also enough to share with a few other people. Simple to cook but interesting items are best.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What else do I need to know?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 When you RSVP, please comment if you have camping gear to bring (tent, sleeping bag, etc.).<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>I've reserved three campsites.<\/b> Each site has a fire ring or fireplace with grill for cooking and a picnic table.<\/p> <p>\u2022 I'd suggest buddy-ing up to save hauling space\/equipment costs. It doesn't matter to me if the accommodations are co-ed or gender segregated, everyone can decide what is most comfortable for them.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Rental gear (tents, sleeping bags, etc.) is available at the Tents and Trails store in downtown NYC, Gear to Go Outfitters in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Eastern Mountain Sports and at several REI stores in the NY\/NJ area.<\/p> <p>\u2022 If you are unsure what to pack, click<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rei.com\/learn\/expert-advice\/family-camping-checklist.html\"> HERE <\/a>for a list. You won't need to bring everything on here, but it's a good start. If you are still unsure, please ask.<\/p> <p>\u2022 The campground has full restroom facilities, hot showers and clean running water.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Meetup will be cancelled only in the event of a zombie apocalypse or locust swarm of biblical proportions. Possibility of rain or any other precipitation and we still camp.<\/p> <p><b>Directions ...<\/b><\/p> <p>42 Main Street (Rte. 130)\u00a0<br\/>Sandwich, MA\u00a0<br\/>[masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Take Rte. 495 South to the intersection with Rte. 6 East.

Come one, come all, and tell your friends as well.<\/p> <p>On <b>Saturday, May 28th<\/b>, (our rain date, due to a previous cancellation) we'll be returning to the event that is not unfamiliar to some of our members: Ultimate Werewolf in Fort Tryon Park. Ultimate Werewolf is a social game in which players are randomly assigned to one of two (or possibly more) teams: the villagers or the werewolves. The villagers must deduce who the werewolves are over a series of rounds using various techniques and social intrigue; this must be done before the werewolves are able to eliminate the villagers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Ultimate Werewolf, check out Tom Vasel's review at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ<\/a><\/p> <p>Ultimate Werewolf is the perfect game to play in an outdoor setting; just bring a folding chair or a picnic blanket and you're ready to go! All you need is the game (which I will supply) and the willingness to communicate with others. We will also be bringing food and beverages in order to picnic throughout the day, so if that aspect of this event interests you, please bring something to pass (though participating in the picnic is not a requirement for this event). Also, if you do not know how to play Ultimate Werewolf, never fear, it is quite simple and several of us will be able to teach it to you within minutes; don't let that hold you back! We'll be meeting in Fort Tryon park, just north of Linden Terrace.

He\u2019s a bright orange bobcat, usually wears a white T-shirt with a red exclamation point. No? How about Bonk? He\u2019s a little short guy with a big head, sports a leopard print loin cloth. Haven\u2019t seen him either huh? Come to think of it, a lot of mascots have gone missing over the years; Earthworm Jim, Boogerman, Aero the Acrobat, all missing. Well you\u2019ll find them at this month\u2019s NAVA; Missing Mascots. All your favorites will be there like Rocket Knight for the Sega Genesis, Joe &amp; Mac for the Super Nintendo, &amp; Bubsy might show up too.<\/p> <p>\n\nArcade challenge! Pocky &amp; Rocky is known for being a fun, addictive, &amp; now very expensive Super Nintendo title, it\u2019s actually the sequel to an arcade game in Japan known as KiKi KaiKai. The game plays just like the SNES game; it\u2019s a scrolling shooter where you play as a little girl &amp; work your way up through the map shooting enemies along the way &amp; rack up the highest score. Be the best at the game on this one day by logging the highest score on our arcade cabinet by 9pm &amp; win a nifty $20 gift certificate &amp; possibly get your name added to the \"House Champion\" tournament plaque on the Wall of Fame just above the arcade section of the store. Arcade challenge games are set to FREE PLAY all day, but please remember to let everyone get a shot. If you get the high score, move on, &amp; no hogging the cabinet! Also if you have won last month\u2019s NAVA arcade challenge you are no eligible to win this month\u2019s challenge.<\/p> <p>\n\nTournament! We will be playing one of the games from the short lived ClayFighter series. Specifically ClayFighter: Tournament Edition for the SNES. Sign-ups begin at 3pm, the tournament starts around 6pm &amp; its first-come, first-served in this FREE-to-join tournament.<\/p> <p>\n\nKeep in mind from now on trade boxes cannot take up more than 5 square feet. To clarify 5 square feet is an area that is 5 feet by 1 foot, 2 &amp; a half feet by 2 feet, or any other way that takes up that much space. Trade boxes can be more than one box; they just need to fit in that much space. We will make exceptions for those who bring art or homebrews. If you bring something you made yourself we will not prevent you from putting out both that &amp; an appropriately sized trade box. We will also make exceptions if you have items that themselves are large, like boxed systems or special editions to certain games. If you brought a CIB Steel Battalion we\u2019re not going to make you pack up half of your other items in your trade box. We will ask you to pack up some things if you bring a lot of large items. We cannot have such large trade boxes anymore because it\u2019s a fire hazard.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nRemember to get your trade boxes in order so we can all buy, sell &amp; trade together. Wear your NAVA or Digital Press t-shirt for the maximum discount on store purchases. Also, bring your Nintendo 3DS to share street passes... it's NAVA time!<\/p> <p>\n\nRSVP (optional):\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/digitpress?sk=events<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>When: Saturday, May 28th, 3pm to midnight.<\/p> <p><br\/>Where: Digital Press Videogames:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/7nobzcr<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>What happens: Gaming, trading, tournaments, big prizes!

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/231428714\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Tennis This Saturday @ Crotona Park","id":"231428714","time":1464469200000,"updated":1464480791000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.09569454193,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462926912000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get In The\u00a0Best Shape\u00a0Of\u00a0Your\u00a0Life\u00a0In 2016<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/7\/a\/8\/event_83110152.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 View our\u00a0Master Class Run on April 3rd:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-City-Runners-Group\/events\/230100642\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-City-Runners-Group\/events\/230100642\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-City-Runners-Group\/events\/230100642\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/4\/c\/highres_86714412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>8th Annual Memorial Day Weekend Blast ~<\/p> <p>For New Members:<\/p> <p>It's cool if you're not a speedy runner. \u00a0You won't be the only one. \u00a0Plus, after The Master Class Run and the running tips you receive, will make you a better and faster runner.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Guaranteed.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/d\/1\/highres_5569617.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Afterwards, while our metabolism is into high gear, we'll go to a nearby cool bar and reward ourselves for our efforts. \u00a0 \ud83c\udf7a\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf79\ud83c\udf7b<\/p> <p>They have good food and drinks that are inexpensive and tasty. \ud83c\udf6e\ud83c\udf57\u2615\ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf75\ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf6f\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our group is a group of runners,\u00a0of all running abilities,\u00a0who work in mostly professional fields.<\/p> <p>Great people to run\u00a0and to socialize with.<\/p> <p>I'll be wearing a black DGA\u00a0(Director's Guild of America)\u00a0baseball hat and I have blond hair.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>That's me in the center: \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/f\/1\/highres_7120433.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>For The Run:\u00a0<\/p> <p>It's best to travel light, or wear\u00a0a backpack and throw your stuff in there. \u00a0The less you bring with you\u00a0the better it is. \u00a0<\/p> <p>At every run, we always get a whole\u00a0bunch of new members who join us\u00a0and add to the mix.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, shoot me a message.<\/p> <p>It's going to be fun.\u00a0<\/p> <p>See you then,<\/p> <p>Marcello<\/p> <p>(Organizer)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/e\/8\/highres_10067592.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/5\/7\/highres_18730839.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>8th Annual Memorial Day Weekend Blast ~ \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Master Class Run &amp; Then Drinks!<\/p> <p>Don't miss the fun -<\/p> <p>Join us on Saturday,\u00a0May 28th.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n****<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-City-Runners-Group\/events\/231029826\/","yes_rsvp_count":57,"name":"8th Memorial Day Weekend Blast! ~ The Master Class Run \ud83c\udfc3 & Then Drinks! \ud83c\udf7a\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf79","id":"231029826","time":1464471900000,"updated":1464497114000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1205799172000,"name":"~ Running\ud83c\udfc3~ Inspired & Fun!

While the teams bring the highest possible level of downforce, mechanical grip and drivability are what make the difference for a quick lap. Given that overtaking is almost impossible, it goes without saying that the qualifying session is the most important of the year for a good result in the race.

It should be followed in this section in backwards order:<\/p> <p>14.47 The Lenape Trail turns right off of the rail bed and ascends through woods to the right. A side trail, unmarked, leaves to the right as well. Follow yellow blazes. The trail makes it's way over interesting topography, and comes out to Ridge Road. The section just before Ridge Road can be very wet, and so it is possible to cut up to the road earlier. Follow the unblazed road walk to the north until the trail re-joins.<br\/>15.00 Continue north on Ridge Road. Cedar Grove Reservoir is to the right.<br\/>15.40 At the utility right of way, the trail turns right off of Ridge Road. It soon turns right off of the right of way and into the woods<br\/>16.20 The trail reaches Normal Road. Turn left to reach parking area in 0.1 mile.<br\/>16.37 Lenape Trail follows the West Trail to the right.<br\/>16.90 The trail comes nearer to homes to the right. Continue. After the trail turns left, the Lenape Trail will leave this trail and head southeast.<br\/>17.15 Enter a somewhat cleared area. Continue ahead to an outstanding view atop a Watchung outcropping. There is a foundation from a former tower, and good views to the east. From here, the trail continues north.<br\/>17.36 The trail reaches an intersection with another trail and turns right.<br\/>17.51 The trail turns hard right at another intersection. Be sure to follow the yellow Lenape Trail blazes as not to follow side trails which often turn away.<br\/>17.68 The trail crosses Highland Ave. It then emerges at the end of Laurel Place, a dead end street.<br\/>17.82 Cross Upper Mountain Ave, followed by the Montclair Boonton Line of NJ Transit at the railroad station.<br\/>17.90 Turn left along Valley Road<br\/>18.12 Turn right along Alexander Avenue.<br\/>18.30 Cross Norwood Ave, and continue on Alexander<br\/>18.41 Cross Park Street and continue on Alexander<br\/>18.50 Pass Park Terrance and Alexander Court, continuing along Alexander Ave.<br\/>18.56 Cross Grove Street and continue.<br\/>18.92 Turn right on Stonehenge Road.<br\/>18.98 The road splits to form a loop. Keep to the right side of the loop and turn right on a path along the north side of Tuers Park.<br\/>19.09 Reach Heller Way and continue straight.<br\/>19.15 Turn left on Yantacaw Brook Road<br\/>19.40 Pass Heller Drive on the left<br\/>19.49 At the intersection with Club Road, continue straight on a paved path into Yantacaw Brook Park.<br\/>19.54 Another paved path leads right to the end of Bellegrove Drive. Continue to the left past a small pond. Continue around the lake, closer to it's shore where another trail leads ahead to Woodmont Road. Lenape Trail continues on to Glenside Terrace.<br\/>19.67 Reach Glenside Terrace and continue straight.<br\/>19.80 Reache Belleview Avenue and cross to enter Brookdale Park. Turn right on a paved trail within the park.<br\/>19.88 Turn right at a fork in the path. Just ahead, continue left where a path leads right to Dryden Road. Skirt tennis courts on the left.<br\/>20.06 Cross the entrance road to Brookdale Park, followed by a paved path. Soon, another paved path turns right to cross West Circuit Drive further into Brookdale Park, and more turn right to Wildwood Ave. More side paths ahead lead to connections to Chester Road, Vernon Road, Gordonhurst Ave, Ridgewood Ave, Hawthorne Ave, and Lovell Terrace. Other paths lead left further into Brookdale Park.<br\/>20.65 An access to the right leads to Emerson Terrace. Ahead, the trail continues on between Whittier Terrace and the entrance road to Brookdale Park.<br\/>20.79 Turn left on Watchung Ave<br\/>20.88 Cross Broad Street and continue.<br\/>20.97 Turn right and follow Club Street.<br\/>21.08 Turn left along Mohr Avenue.<br\/>21.17 Cross Bell Street<br\/>21.27 Turn right onto Clair Street.<br\/>21.34 At a school, turn left through a parking area and then along the school's east side.<br\/>21.43 Turn left on a paved path past baseball fields.<br\/>21.56 Another path comes in from the right. It leads to Brookdale Gardens community. The Lenape Trail continues ahead across a small foot bridge.<br\/>21.62 The trail emerges on Bessida Street and continues.<br\/>21.71 Turn left on Broughton Ave.<br\/>21.86 Turn right on Pilch Street<br\/>21.96 At the end of Pilch Street, a pathway leads to the right. It leads up onto a foot bridge over the Garden State Parkway. This same foot bridge should also be used when tracing the Morris Canal's historic route.<br\/>22.06 Reach the east side of Pilch Street and continue across East Passaic Avenue.<br\/>22.15 Turn left on Sadler Road<br\/>22.20 Turn right on Watchung Place<br\/>22.35 Reach the intersection with Glenview Road and cross onto a power line, then turn right immediately along a buried pipe right of way.<br\/>22.55 Cross over the intersection of Glenview Road, Ridge Road, and Chestnut Street and continue on the buried pipe right of way, passing a ball field on the left.<br\/>22.80 Cross Bloomfield Avenue and continue across on Church Street<br\/>23.22 Reach North Franklin Avenue. Turn left and then cross North Franklin at the crosswalk, continuing along Booth Drive near Nutley Library.<br\/>23.38 Cross Vincent Drive and enter Booth Park. Soon join a paved path along the river.<br\/>23.48 Turn left and cross the river on a pedestrian bridge, then turn right along the other side.<br\/>23.73 Cross Centre Street<br\/>23.88 Turn right and cross the river once again on a foot bridge, then turn left along the other side. Soon turn left along Ravine Road.<br\/>24.04 Reach Harrison Street and turn left across the river on the road bridge.<br\/>24.10 Cross Harrison Street to the right and follow Ernest Street south.<br\/>24.27 At a ninety degree bend in the road, continue slightly to the left along a utility right of way.<br\/>24.41 Along the utility right of way, cross power lines.<br\/>24.54 Cross Chestnut Street on the right of way near the intersection with Moore Place.<br\/>24.64 Reach and turn right along Passaic Ave<br\/>24.77 Turn sharp to the right to remain on Passaic Ave.<br\/>24.86 Turn left along Joralemon Street<br\/>25.15 Turn to the right and follow Garden Avenue<br\/>25.45 A golf course borders Garden Ave on the right.<br\/>25.70 Reach Belleville Ave and turn left.<br\/>25.85 Cross Belleville Ave at a crosswalk and enter Belleville Park on a paved path near ball fields. Skirt the ball fields to the left. Watch the yellow blazes because other pathways break off!<br\/>25.94 At a fork in the path, turn right, just south of the ball fields.<br\/>26.13 At a four way intersection with paved paths, turn left to cross Mill Street. After the street, a foot bridge crosses the Second River. Do not cross, but rather turn left to descend to another path below. NOTE: This section of trail should be a re-route. The original route remained on this side of the river, and continued out to Franklin Ave.<br\/>26.27 Turn left on a path along the Second River.<br\/>26.34 Turn right along Park Drive to cross the Second River bridge. On the other side, immediately turn right onto a path that parallels the river.<br\/>26.52 Pass beneath the foot bridge over the river.<br\/>26.63 Pass under a railroad bridge parallel with Mill Street.<br\/>26.74 Remain parallel with Mill Street to the right at a fork in the road.<br\/>26.85 Reach North Franklin Street and turn left over the crosswalk, then immediately turn left into Branch Brook Park. Pass through trees. In the Spring, there is a glorious Cherry Blossom Festival within Branch Brook Park, truly a sight to see.<br\/>27.00 The trail crosses a Branch Brook Park roadway on a crosswalk. It then turns right, then loops around to join another paved path to the right.<br\/>27.25 Another paved path comes in from the left.<br\/>27.34 Turn left at another intersection from beside baseball fields through trees. Continue on the paved path skirting the east side of the park.<br\/>27.53 Reach the Branch Brook Park Road and turn left on the paved path parallel with the road, passing beneath an abandoned rail line.<\/p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/225432_10150203545951777_2456747_n.jpg?oh=af66b47cf90540c784714aa1d88df92d&amp;oe=579735B2\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/225432_10150203545951777_2456747_n.jpg?oh=af66b47cf90540c784714aa1d88df92d&amp;oe=579735B2<\/a><\/p> <p>For any questions or concerns, contact me at[masked]<br\/>Hope to see you on the trail<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Park at the far west side of the lot well away from most of the customers as not to take up all of their space.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Metrotrails\/events\/229682641\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"911 Memorial Trail Hike Part 4; Newark and Little Falls","id":"229682641","time":1464526800000,"updated":1464649437000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1321325613000,"name":"Metrotrails: NJ, PA, NY Metropolitan Area Hiking and More!","group_lon":-74.5,"id":2814872,"urlname":"Metrotrails","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"\"Hikers\""},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":11.2061014175,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463345442000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>[UPDATE 26-MAY]<\/p> <p>Finally the weather looks very promising.

So we are leaving Queens at 9:30 sharp. I have updated our meetup time accordingly.<\/p> <p>See you all Sun am for a great day!<\/p> <p><br\/>* * *<\/p> <p><br\/>Unfortunately, this weekend looks wet again (sigh). I've changed the ride date to Memorial weekend Sunday. Pls update your RSVPs if this affects your plans. Also, I will try to arrange to join another meetup group together on this trip for a larger group and more fun. This is unconfirmed for now. I will post an update on that some time next week.<\/p> <p>* * *<\/p> <p>There hasn't been much going on in this group recently, so I elect to propose a ride. Plus, what better way to meet new buddies and make new friends than to schedule a ride???<\/p> <p>The weather looks terrrrific this coming weekend. Up for bids is a day ride this Saturday! We will ride to northern CT to a place called Haystack Mtn SP. There is a stone tower there which we will climb and enjoy the views from.<\/p> <p>There will be tons of beautiful vistas to enjoy on our way with some countryside sections thrown in for good measure. We will largely ride back roads and enjoy the scenery. Most of the route is in western CT. We will pass by many lakes, ride along and cross several rivers. We will stop on the way back by a dam\/waterfall.<\/p> <p>We will keep our time on highways to minimum. This is a site-seeing expedition, not a speed daemons' race. Show your competence by doing the twisties gracefully and confidently. Sport bikes preferred (for the twisties) but all skill levels welcome. We will wait for the congregation to assemble as needed.<\/p> <p>Bring plenty of water and snacks for the scenic rest stops away from civilization to relax, stretch limbs, marvel, take pics, eat and otherwise chill.<\/p> <p>I ask that you please RSVP early if possible. This is for me to get an idea how many riders may be going and get a feel for the general skill level of riders in the group so that I can plan the pace, logistics and fine-tune the route.<\/p> <p>Meet at 9:30am at Burger King parking lot on Rte 25A, Bayside, Queens, NY (see map). Leave at 10 sharp. I will announce detailed agenda for the day and offer a safety briefing before we move out. Trip length is 250 miles or thereabouts.<\/p> <p>Please prepare your bodies (rest) and equipment (service) ahead of time. Have good breakfast on the day. Gas up before the ride, don't disrespect your fellow riders by arriving empty. Bring your ez-pass, if you have it. We will only need it twice, to get over to the Bronx and back. It's much easier that way (and less expensive too).<\/p> <p>Please note squids need not apply for this ride. This is a full day trip and I want to make sure everyone gets home safe. Full gear required.<\/p> <p>In case of rain, cold weather or otherwise unfavourable aura the trip will be cancelled or rescheduled (for the sole reason we wouldn't see much from the top of the mtn :-))). Please bring a midlayer regardless, Sat morning will likely be chilly before things warm up.<\/p> <p>Cheers!!!<\/p> <p>PeterD<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/last-Minute-Motorcycle-Riders\/events\/231147656\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":32400000,"name":"Scenic Ride to Haystack Mtn.","id":"231147656","time":1464526800000,"updated":1464560694000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328065817000,"name":"last Minute Motorcycle Riders","group_lon":-73.7799987793,"id":3210382,"urlname":"last-Minute-Motorcycle-Riders","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Riders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Fort Washington Avenue and 179th Street","name":"Outside George Washington Bridge Bus Station Temporary Waiting Room","lon":-73.93895,"id":23763850,"state":"NY","lat":40.8493,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.37704563141,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460415449000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":7,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>About 23 miles and 9 hours, <b>fast-paced<\/b> hike across the George Washington Bridge then north along the Palisades on the Batt to Bear Trail and the Old Erie Path to Nyack.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/231138611\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:30 am!","id":"hssxjlyvhbmc","time":1464528600000,"updated":1464541074000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463966236000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>EVENT TYPE<\/b>: Sports<\/p> <p><b>ADMISSION PRICE<\/b>: $10.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses,Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses,Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

In the past, this show has easily seen 200,000 people fill up the beach on a single day. It is not unusual for the parking lots to be filled by 11:00am (if not earlier). When this happens, the parkways are closed and people are turned away. So, it is probably a good idea to arrive before 10:00am, or as early as reasonably possible.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUNSCREEN. Bring it. You will be in the sun for over five hours. Trust me, you will need plenty of it.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BAGS, BACKPACKS, AND COOLERS ARE OK (this is a beach you know), but keep in mind THEY WILL BE SEARCHED so don't bring too much stuff along with you. It will also get crowded near show-center, and extra baggage could make movement difficult. There is a nice fast-food style restaurant on the East end of the beach, and refreshment vendors will be located along the boardwalk. If you want to keep costs low, you may want to bring along your own drinks and snacks. There will be no bleachers or seating of any sort (with the exception of the VIP Chalets that require a separate entry fee purchased before the show), so bring a blanket to sit on, or a foldable chair. If you plan on sitting close to the water, you might want to bring a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Even though the air temperature may be warm, the waters will still be cold and can cause the area right by the shoreline to be surprisingly chilly.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>EARPLUGS are suggested for the younger viewers (under 3 years), but aren't a bad idea for some of the grown-up viewers as well. The jets can get loud, and you might get stuck next to some annoying guy who won't shut up about his cats.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Photography is always fun at an air show, but there are several things to keep in mind, and you should know the limits of your camera. Even though the planes will be close, they will still be far enough away that you will need a decent amount of zoom. The beach faces South, directly into the sun, so most everything will be backlit all day. Also, the air tends to get quite hazy, making it difficult to get a crisp shot. Don't let these handicaps prevent you from bringing your camera, however. You never know what kind of moments you will be able to capture.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>KITES ARE PROHIBITED. They can easily distract the performers, and that could result in some rather nasty stuff. Please leave these flying machines at home.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NO PETS. Of course, this excludes animals that aid the handicapped. Unless that animal happens to be a ferret, and if you are using a ferret to lead you around everywhere, you will probably have trouble getting to the show in the first place.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/www.jonesbeach.com\/images\/2012\/airshow2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>May 28 &amp; 29, 2016<\/b><b><br\/>Airshow commences at 10:00 a.<\/b><b>m.<br\/>Airshow concludes at 3:00 p.m.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WE GOING BOTH DAYS.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Arrive early, Glasses,Sunscreen, Bring lunch, water, hat, suntan lotion.

We will move at a fast pace but we will stop a number of times to talk very briefly about what we see. Central Park is really a work of art and you will see why. You\u2019ll learn about the history of the Park and its unique design features that many people are unaware of. You will be sure to see things you never saw before. Since its Memorial Day Weekend, we\u2019ll visit a few war memorials as well. Even if you have done this with me before-there is always something new. I have led a shorter modified version of this hike for The Guides Association of NYC (GANYC) . This event will be even better.<\/p> <p>I will not be leading most of my city hikes for AMC in the future except I hope to continue to lead a few hikes in the woods from time to time and hopefully I will lead this Memorial Day weekend event on an annual basis as well as some other hikes I have led on holiday weekends.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>We will meet BEFORE 10:00 A.M.

NO FOOD STOPS.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>MEETING DETAILS WILL BE SENT BY E-MAIL TO THOSE WHO RSVP ON THE FRIDAY EVENING BEFORE THE HIKE.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0Please consider joining the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/<\/a> The Club offers many hikes, walks and events and is also active in conservation efforts and trail maintenance. Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails from Yahoo. (Contact me if you are a dues paying AMC Club member and don\u2019t get these e-mails and I\u2019ll tell you how). Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup events that I have led or are a chronic abuser of the RSVP process \u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up. Some priority will be given to those who have previously attended other AMC Meetup events that I have led.<\/p> <p>\u00a0I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 7:00 A.M. If there is no notice, we go. We will probably finish by 1:30 in mid Park.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/231171282\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Unlock the Secrets of Central Park, Sunday-Memorial Day Weekend","id":"231171282","time":1464530400000,"updated":1464632020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351543614000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club New York-North Jersey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":5616472,"urlname":"Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"AMC Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"150 5th Ave","name":"New Balance New York","lon":-73.991081,"id":23926683,"lat":40.739483,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":0.730464994907,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435329425000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/New+Balance+New+York\/@40.7396232,-73.9913588,17z\/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x89c259a3a56ebf19:0xdac5105662cafb9a!2sNew+Balance+New+York!3m1!1s0x89c259a3a56ebf19:0xdac5105662cafb9a\">New Balance NYC<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewBalanceNYC-Group-Run-Meetup\/events\/230990979\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Grab your running shoes, bring a friend, and join us for a run!","id":"jxrwhlyvhbmc","time":1464530400000,"updated":1464543040000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435328720000,"name":"NewBalance NYC Run Group Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18700533,"urlname":"NewBalanceNYC-Group-Run-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sunday Runday Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"99 Le Ferves Lane","name":"Five Islands Park","lon":-73.769562,"id":19044162,"state":"NY","lat":40.916328,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3078556061,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461416728000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Registration on the L.L.

To ensure this is an enjoyable experience for everyone I've capped the class at 25 people- which brings me back to #5...please only RSVP if you definitely plan on coming.<\/p> <p>5. My classes are a combo of Hatha, Vinyasa and Restorative. What that means is that I like to get our bodies moving with a few faster moving sequences to warm up our muscles, then hold some poses for a few breaths and then take our time to slow our bodies down.<\/p> <p>6. Any skill level is welcome, however please note that my classes are more geared towards the beginner\/intermediate students.<\/p> <p>7. Have fun! This group is meant to be a safe space where people can come together and practice yoga - no matter your experience!

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/231179653\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"cvdgrlyvhbmc","time":1464537600000,"updated":1464549322000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10026","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"46 West 116th Street","name":"Mist Harlem","lon":-73.94854,"id":11397342,"state":"NY","lat":40.801228,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.15973949432,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460473531000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\u00a0<br\/>Join us at another\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FAfroJam.org%2F&amp;h=5AQFHlUZu&amp;enc=AZOakJcTqSYjVw8FVJY4e90XILgZg4cwmumhXwZdTpnN07TNZO-_n_p5AJ-kOKCgPJ4&amp;s=1\">AfroJam.org<\/a>\u00a0Brunch series themed AfroBeats Brunch.

We have been reading a lot of feminist theory\/history literature, so I am going to switch it up by choosing a novel which is written by a woman (yay!) and has a woman as the main character throughout the entire book. It will be interesting to discuss, because she\u00a0 turns to prostitution to make ends meet, but is always aware of who she is.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here is a summary:<\/p> <p>\"Near the end of World War II, seventeen-year-old Mireille de Jouarre flees the home of her stepfather, a Nazi collaborator and abusive drunk. She finds shelter with her childhood friend Stefan, and the two fall deeply in love. But as the fighting escalates, Mireille must escape alone to Paris, where she discovers she\u2019s pregnant and lacking a way to provide for her child.<\/p> <p>So begins her new life as l\u2019Ange\u2014the Angel. After an unlikely meeting with a wealthy aristocrat in a Parisian hotel\u2014and her acceptance of his solicitation\u2014Mireille becomes the most celebrated <i>poule<\/i> in all of France, eliciting huge fees and invitations to exclusive parties. At one of these events, Mireille meets Oliver Jordan, an American womanizer and film producer, and is soon launching a promising film career. As her star rises, Mireille is determined to bury her past. But her success isn\u2019t as carefree and glittery as it seems, and when her daughter\u2019s future is threatened, Mireille must make a deadly decision in a desperate attempt to finally choose her own path.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe point of this book club is to constantly inform ourselves, while also celebrating female lead characters. This will be our first fiction book, and a very racy one to boot.<\/p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mireille-Molly-Cochran-ebook\/dp\/B00ORBNEP6\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459727839&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mireille\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mireille-Molly-Cochran-ebook\/dp\/B00ORBNEP6\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459727839&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mireille\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mireille-Molly-Cochran-ebook\/dp\/B00ORBNEP6\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459727839&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mireille<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>As for now, I listed the meetup at my home, until the date gets closer and we can\u00a0 get a closer idea of what the weather will be like.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, RSVP to this, and head on over to the discussion board, where you can find 2 new threads:<\/p> <p>1) A shirt\/patch option I am working on.

For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>Ari Shaffir, Gregory K. Nick Griffin, Greer Barnes, Godfrey, Christian Finnegan, Jon Laster, Damien Lemon and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup. Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FREE-or-inexpensive-things-to-do-on-Long-Island\/events\/231446118\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup 2 drink min.

We have had far too many no-shows.<\/p> <p>You will see progress in your writing project by spending the minimum of a single hour per week on it. This is your practice\/focus time, so I hope to see you there.<\/p> <p>Join other writers for an hour of focused writing!<\/p> <p>7-8 pm - Show up early, stake out a spot and either socialize or get a jump on writing.<br\/>8:00 - Start. Introductions, and we'll share what we're working on<br\/>8:05 - Get down to business. An hour of silence and solid writing!<br\/>9:05- Brief follow up. People are encouraged to share experiences &amp; ideas, network or take off as they like. Feel free to keep writing if you've got the momentum going! Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing. It may just be \"pipe-cleaning\" for now, but you'll feel better showing up at the page. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice.<\/p> <p>WHERE: Argo Tea Cafe, Columbus Circle Subway Station. 1792 Broadway.<\/p> <p>SOME TIPS:<\/p> <p>Argo has plenty of outlets - we will be on the back, large table.<br\/>Seats are hard to come by, and I can only save so many, so please, come on time! If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/231294210\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflyvhbmc","time":1464566400000,"updated":1464571130000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!
