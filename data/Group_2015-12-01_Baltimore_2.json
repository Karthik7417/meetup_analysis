Our group is mostly divorced women 50+ with a shared love of not only the well written word, but the arts too (theater, galleries, good movies, music, PBS) and those interested do some  of those things together as well. Some of us are also artists or crafts women doing creative projects like knitting, quilting, crocheting, beading, jewelry making, painting, etc.). However, the important thing we all have in common is our appreciation of really good literature, well written books that inspire, and our yearly picks include no \"fluff\". So, this is a great group for serious readers (not that some of us don't read mysteries, suspense, non fiction, etc. on the side too). \nWe look forward to knowing you, however, because we meet in the founders  home, she will contact you directly  and ask you to call her so you can talk a bit first.

Are you longing for a better way to address society's pressing challenges? This discussion group is based on the idea that it can be possible to find common ground across the political spectrum if we can gain a better understanding of each others perspectives through face to face dialogue. People of all political stripes who are open-minded and curious are welcome. The objectives are to 1) bring together participants with diverse political views, 2) conduct a respectful and productive conversation about a difficult topic in a safe environment, and 3) explore possible areas of common ground. To promote these goals, discussions will be loosely structured around a format called \u201cLiving Room Conversations\u201d (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/<\/a>), which has been successful in finding common ground between groups as politically disparate as the Tea Party and MoveOn.org.

Since, by definition, existence cannot come from non-existence, an accurate understanding of reality itself requires the acceptance of an \u201cArche\u201d, an eternal and fundamental basis of reality in a constant state of becoming. Aristotle postulated such reality as a conversion of potential into actuality in an all-encompassing process termed \u201cEntelechy\u201d. This perspective allows for a pivotal understanding of life, intelligence and the divine as evolutionary events occurring along a continuum. God is traditionally viewed as the pinnacle of intelligence, power, and complexity, but existence cannot begin with such qualities. Rather, the universe evolves in complexity over time: it was not created by God, but is God <i>in potentia<\/i>. Thus we can propose a unification of science and religion in which a creator God is a logical impossibility, but God as the end-product of cosmic evolution is logical. The Universe is converting infinite potential into maximum actualization; and we are participants in the entire process, which is perhaps the ultimate meaning of life.<\/p>","lon":-77.0199966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":25364842,"name":"Antonei Benjamin Csoka","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/highres_67294722.jpeg","photo_id":67294722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/member_67294722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/thumb_67294722.jpeg"}},"members":96,"name":"Illuminism Institute","id":18503089,"state":"DC","urlname":"Illuminism-Institute","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":38.9500007629,"who":"Illuminists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426565946000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"amerhistory","name":"American History","id":1793},{"urlkey":"museum","name":"Museum","id":7319},{"urlkey":"history","name":"History","id":7789},{"urlkey":"activities","name":"Activities","id":15116},{"urlkey":"walking-tours","name":"Walking Tours","id":19605},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"local-history","name":"local history","id":25191},{"urlkey":"historical-tours","name":"Historical Tours","id":73281},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MDHistoryAndCulture\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/5\/600_444362597.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Join us as we visit the best historical places and cultural events throughout Maryland: including the Washington, DC suburbs, Baltimore, Annapolis, the Eastern Shore and the western regions. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>You may also be interested in our flagship Meetup group,&nbsp;<b><i>Washington DC History &amp;

There are many other factors such as backgrounds, clothing and the message you want to convey that go into creating a portrait. Those will all be addressed as needed or in a separate class. The classes are for people who want to improve their people portraits. Anyone can pick up a camera these days and take a photo but to take a portrait to the next level requires more thought, understanding and a lot of practice. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I'd like to see how the group evolves, but for now we'll&nbsp;get together on location, near Silver Spring, Bethesda and NW and learn about natural portrait posing and lighting. Sometimes we will go for an urban look and other times we might go to a park. We will look for lighting situations that mimic studio lighting without lighting equipment (except maybe a reflector). We will pose each other as singles, couples and groups and occasionally we'll have a model. Next fall I may teach studio portraits.

This group is for promoting health and wellness through an ancient practice called QiGong. What is Qigong? Qigong focuses on improving physical health and wellness. It opens the energy flow within the body by eliminating blockages. The intent is to balance the body by opening the energetic pathways (meridians). This is accomplished by a series of gentle movements synchronized with the breath. This form of Qigong can be safely practiced by the beginner, with limited movement, to the most advanced student. It benefits all students and aides them in moving forward no matter what their prior experiences. Each class is started with a set of Opening Moves to allow the body structure to open in all directions. Next, we move through the Qigong movements. These movements focus on Energy passing through specific pathways (or meridians). The class ends with a closing Qigong form that integrates the mind-body-spirit to a more grounded state of well-being. Qigong is an excellent tool to acquire mind-body-spirit awareness. Its movements provide a path toward personal transformation. Each individual may have a different experience each time they practice the form. The goal is as they work toward balance of the Yin-Yang Qi they will notice improved health, increased energy and a greater awareness of life. What are the benefits? Qigong enhances immune function, reduces the ill effects of stress, prevents disease, calms the mind and emotions, lowers blood pressure, increases flexibility, cultivates energy, treats chronic pain, and improves sleep.<\/p>","lon":-76.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":86625662,"name":"joff headley","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/highres_245134649.jpeg","photo_id":245134649,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/member_245134649.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/thumb_245134649.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Laurel Qigong Meetup","id":18535847,"state":"MD","urlname":"Laurel-Qigong-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.0999984741,"who":"qi members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hyattsville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428520023000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"homeless","name":"Homelessness","id":3777},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"family-and-friends","name":"Family and Friends","id":16929},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"healthy-lifestyles","name":"Healthy Lifestyles","id":32598},{"urlkey":"event-planning-fundraising","name":"Event Planning & Fundraising","id":77233},{"urlkey":"ptsd-recovery","name":"PTSD Recovery","id":88088},{"urlkey":"military-and-veterans","name":"Military and Veterans","id":91416},{"urlkey":"grief-recovery","name":"Grief Recovery","id":105011},{"urlkey":"homeless-outreach","name":"Homeless Outreach","id":168756},{"urlkey":"complementary-and-alternative-therapies","name":"Complementary and Alternative Therapies","id":1064432}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VeteransForeverSoldiers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Veterans Forever Soldiers (VFS) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization with a mission to Honor, Respect, and Care for United States Military Veterans.

Are you a single black woman, that&nbsp;has realized that everyone around you has kids and\/or married and you feel left out? You often find yourself the only one at events with no kids and husband, maybe a boyfriend. It's fun chilling and spending time with our boyfriends, but every woman needs good girlfriends too. Men don't always want to do what we want to do.&nbsp;Do you often find yourself not having many girlfriends or&nbsp;female relatives&nbsp;to hang out with&nbsp;any more because they have relocated, gotten married, have&nbsp;mommy duties or have a certain time to be home.&nbsp;Do you sometimes&nbsp;find yourself sitting at home on a beautiful sunny day with no girlfriends&nbsp;to chill with. Or on a weekend night watching Lifetime, LMN&nbsp;or Bravo? Do you just want to be spontaneous sometimes and just call and&nbsp;say let's go out or do something fun?&nbsp;This group is for heterosexual, Christian, &nbsp;professional, classy, intelligent, positive and drama-free and like-minded women that are seeking to socialize and build true lasting friendships that will develop into a sisterhood. This will be a small group to foster a close knit and engaging atmosphere. The group will consist of women that are supportive, encouraging, inspirational and uplifting&nbsp;to one another. Let's engage in some awesome activities, while developing bonds and making memories that will last a lifetime. Some of the activities include: dining, brunch, lounges,&nbsp;cruises, festivals, concerts, plays, broadway musicals, live bands, weekend getaways, movies, spas, picnics and day trips. Having&nbsp;children or getting married doesn't define you,&nbsp;they enhance your life. We never know what God has in store for us. Until then,&nbsp;let's live our lives and enjoy us until we do get married and become moms.&nbsp;If you are interested in meeting other wonderful, like-minded ladies to explore the DMV and so much more, please join this group. I understand that sometimes you won't be able to attend every outing, but please be an active participant to make this group a success. This is not just a meetup but friendship group. Constant no shows will lead to the member being deleted from the group.<b>&nbsp;Currently this group is closed to new members.<\/b><\/p>","lon":-76.8499984741,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12883359,"name":"Ms. Liss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/highres_245843547.jpeg","photo_id":245843547,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/member_245843547.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/thumb_245843547.jpeg"}},"members":115,"name":"Laurel Sisterhood Meetup Ages 30-40 (Single\/Without Kids)","id":18573534,"state":"MD","urlname":"Lovely-Ladies-of-Laurel-Meetup-Ages-33-39-Single-No-Kids","category":{"name":"women","id":35,"shortname":"women"},"lat":39.0600013733,"who":"Lovely Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430603561000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"trail-running","name":"Trail Running","id":16301},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"beginners-running","name":"Beginner's Running","id":24325},{"urlkey":"womens-running","name":"Women's Running","id":37072},{"urlkey":"long-distance-running","name":"Long Distance Running","id":38289},{"urlkey":"road-running","name":"Road Running","id":49699},{"urlkey":"running-with-friends","name":"Running with Friends","id":92083},{"urlkey":"running-training","name":"running training","id":99282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BaltimoreRATrunners\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>We are a social running group that welcomes people of all paces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While Baltimore is known for its rats that scurry underneath, we scurry over Roads And Trails --we are the Baltimore RAT Runners.&nbsp;It seems many of our runners are new to town, so if \"B'more\" and \"Hon\" are new to you, you should feel right at home with us.<\/p> \n<p>Our Monday runs start at 6:45 p.m. next to the Under Armour store on S.

Lama\u2019s students were excited to welcome a qualified Tibetan Buddhist teacher into the community and wanted to provide a place for learning and practicing Dharma.&nbsp;<br><br>As a growing community of lay Dharma practitioners, we are grounded in but not limited to the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage. The Center consists of a small shrine room, and we are actively looking to enlarge our facility.<br><br><b>ABOUT OUR MAIN TEACHER<\/b><br><br>Our community is grateful for the opportunity to learn and practice under the direction of an authentic, accomplished guide, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche.&nbsp;<br><br>Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book&nbsp;<i>The Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha<\/i>.&nbsp;<br><br>He has completed a traditional three-year retreat under the guidance of the Very Venerable Bokar Rinpoche, who subsequently appointed Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche to be a three-year-retreat teacher. He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<br><br>______________________________________<br><br><i>The Gampopa Center has an open door policy.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<p>What we offer: Our ongoing drop-in Tuesday evening classes generally consist of one or two half hour semi-guided meditations, mindful movement, a talk on Buddhist principles and their application to daily life, followed by discussion and\/or practice.<\/p>\n<p>We offer workshops (typically day long) to help deepen practice. Some of our workshop topics are: Deepening Insight, a Daylong Silent Workshop; Insight Out Loud (working with partners to deepen insight); A Day of Heart Practices; Deepening Presence; and a Relationship Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Our 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses help students initiate and develop an ongoing daily mindfulness meditation practice. These 8-week courses are designed to help students develop strategies to reduce stress and to relate to their day-to-day experiences in a more calm and creative manner.<\/p>\n<p>We also sponsor Kalyani-Mitta (KM) groups. These are groups that meet outside the normal class hours to discuss Buddhist principles more in depth and to share about how these ideas apply to their personal lives. These groups also help foster deeper connection to other members of the community (sangha).<\/p>\n<p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Stan Eisenstein, MSW<\/b>,&nbsp;is a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for&nbsp;30 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

I am less interested in having a support group or therapy sessions, and more interested in just having fun with some down-to-Earth, good-natured people who don't have the most active social lives, or are just plain bored. Anyone is welcome, but just keep in mind that I myself am not exactly a socialite, and am doing this as a way to get out of the house more. Don't expect large gatherings of dozens of people or rowdy nights out; I'm more into just relaxing, going to the movies, or finding a place to hang out where we can do something simple.<\/p>\n<p>I've also found that many meetup groups tend to have members of mixed ages, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I think it'd be nice to have a group in the Baltimore area (I'm in Dundalk, or the 21224 zip code for reference) for shy people exclusively in their 20's so that we don't have to feel even more out of place or awkward than we already might. Also, groups geared toward very specific, \"geeky\" activities are fine, but unless you're intimately familiar with whatever the hobby is, there's a good chance that you'll stand out or feel insecure if you have anxiety and aren't a super expert at anything in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I don't want anyone to have to feel that way. I just want friends -- regardless of what their knowledge of advanced literature or geek culture is like, and without anyone having to worry about not fitting in or being drowned out in a large crowd. Let's see if we can get a small group of friends going in a totally chill, non-judgmental environment where there's less emphasis on constant meetups and more emphasis on just connecting as people, on our time, whenever we feel comfortable doing so. I'm totally fine with Skyping or having casual phone conversations when we're unable to meet in person, as well.<\/p>\n<p>One other thing: Because I do have some anxiety issues that I'm trying to overcome, I'm not too into traveling long distances for meetups, or doing anything like going to clubs or concerts. I'm just looking for something interesting and relaxing to do in Dundalk or the surrounding areas of Baltimore County, even if it's just getting something to eat or seeing a movie or going to the mall and sitting around once in a while -- and, again, as I'm more interested in genuine friendships than in \"activity partners,\" I'm totally fine with just talking on the phone once in a while or doing some online gaming or something like that. I really have no idea what this group should be, so if you have any ideas, definitely let me know. I read too many posts on sites like reddit about how people waste their 20's being lonely, and I think that if you're in that boat, let's forget what a conventional meetup is \"supposed\" to be and just try to be awesome friends.<\/p>","lon":-76.5400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183202915,"name":"Paul"},"members":175,"name":"Baltimore 20 Somethings Introverts","id":18710892,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-20-Somethings-Introverts","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Crofton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435760213000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"standard-poodles","name":"Standard Poodles","id":26808},{"urlkey":"standard-poodle-playdates","name":"Standard Poodle Playdates","id":99359},{"urlkey":"standard-poodle-play-group","name":"Standard Poodle Play Group","id":99380}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crofton-Standard-Poodles-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Hi, woof, &amp; welcome to all the Standard Poodle owners in and around the Crofton area!!

<br><i>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Answer:<\/i>&nbsp; First, please keep in mind that the <i>Women's Christian Trauma Freedom Group<\/i> is firmly centered on the concept of \"healing at your own pace.\"&nbsp; Everyone will receive the same opportunities to move forward in freedom and abundant life; what you choose to act on (and when) is completely up to you.&nbsp; The possibility also exists for one-on-one, personalized coaching with me for any who may desire a more focused approach. <br> <br> <br>About Janet <br> <br>Janet Thompson MA, CPC is a Certified Professional Coach and childhood domestic violence and abuse survivor.&nbsp; For over 19 years, Janet has coached individuals and leaders of all kinds, from church pastors to childhood abuse survivors; from those in troubled marriages to \"ordinary\" women desiring to grow in community, strength, and faith. <br> <br>Janet's heart for reaching out to women first drew her to coaching.&nbsp; After obtaining her Master's degree in Christian Ministry with a certification in Marriage and Family, she developed and ran <i>Becoming<\/i> -- a monthly group coaching and retreat program for women.&nbsp; For almost two years, the women under her care came together regularly to find balance in their busy lives, explore their relationship with Our Lord, build a network of support for the journey, and become all they were meant to be in Christ.&nbsp; Energized by this experience, Janet has been coaching ever since. <br> <br>In addition to her work as a professional coach, Janet has given more than 280 presentations, classes, and workshops around the nation; including Phoenix, Seattle, Baltimore, and the Midwest.&nbsp; Her audiences have ranged from groups of under 20 to over 200, from teens to adults. &nbsp; <br> <br>Janet firmly adheres to the International Coaching Federation (ICF) Code of Ethics for all her group, marriage, and individual coaching clients. <br> <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br>Theme photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/alanasise\">Alana Sise<\/a> (adapted image per <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/\">CC BY 2.0<\/a>)<\/p>","lon":-76.8399963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/0\/f\/highres_439315823.jpeg","photo_id":439315823,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/0\/f\/600_439315823.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/0\/f\/thumb_439315823.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":189368417,"name":"Janet Thompson, MA","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/e\/2\/c\/highres_247552780.jpeg","photo_id":247552780,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/e\/2\/c\/member_247552780.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/e\/2\/c\/thumb_247552780.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Women's Christian Trauma Freedom Group","id":18713129,"state":"MD","urlname":"womenoffreedom","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Women of Freedom"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435888623000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"environment","name":"Environment","id":89},{"urlkey":"permaculture","name":"Permaculture","id":2527},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"therapy","name":"Therapy","id":10457},{"urlkey":"farmersmarket","name":"Farmers Market","id":10508},{"urlkey":"green-living","name":"Green Living","id":15398},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"organic-foods","name":"Organic Foods","id":15485},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"organic-gardening","name":"Organic Gardening","id":20465},{"urlkey":"sustainable-food","name":"Sustainable Food","id":21114},{"urlkey":"local-food","name":"Local Food","id":25083},{"urlkey":"organic-farming","name":"Organic Farming","id":27272},{"urlkey":"herbal-gardening-horticulture","name":"Herbal Gardening & Horticulture","id":55609}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Talmar-Gardens-and-Horticultural-Therapy-Center\/","rating":0,"description":"Talmar Gardens and Horticultural Therapy Center (TALMAR) is a nonprofit organization established to provide a therapeutic and recreational environment offering horticultural and other complementary modalities to the Baltimore metropolitan community.

We vacillate between our past and future unable to thrive in the present moment, The Now. Each moment spent dwelling on the past that is over or imagining a future that is unknown, is a moment stolen from our Life right here and now. The now is what holds the Joy, Enthusiasm, Peace, Calm, Clarity, Efficiency, Productivity. Neither at home, nor in school are we taught skills on how to live in the now. The secret to living in the now, is hidden in the breath. <br><\/p>\n<p>Come explore the breath, and experience the magic through yogic breathing taught by trained teachers from the <b>Art of Living Foundaiton<\/b>.

We can add to the&nbsp;list later what we choose together. We will work on what I call the no_framework codebase which can be used for building any web app that handles objects in CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) fashion.<\/p>\n<p>The organiser would encourage members to join him in focusing the source code towards functionality for school bus contractors. However, I'm sure the no_framework code can be applied to improving any other person or business' workflow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>Why &nbsp;join?<\/p>\n<p>Join this group to learn and build a PHP codebase which we can share amongst ourselves. It's better when people put their efforts in a more focused endeavor. There are many PHP novices who are turned off by the prospect of learning a PHP framework. The learning curve is huge and in the end you may not agree with the way the framework does things.<\/p>\n<p> <br>What members can expect? What are typical activities? <br><\/p>\n<p>Members can expect a meetup every month or two where someone would give a small talk about the no_framework PHP project. And in between meetups individual members can stay in touch and do GitHub pull requests to help improve the no_framework codebase. Also, many who are novices to PHP may find they need parts of their project implemented in JavaScript, CSS or other front end technologies. So, members who have proficiency in those can give talks and contribute code which is in those technologies.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":44835172,"name":"Sameh Ramzy Labib","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/9\/c\/highres_248051676.jpeg","photo_id":248051676,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/9\/c\/member_248051676.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/9\/c\/thumb_248051676.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"Linthicum no_framework PHP Project","id":18754395,"state":"MD","urlname":"Linthicum-no_framework-PHP-Project","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437415390000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"workout","name":"Workout","id":22439},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"friendship-and-support","name":"Friendship and Support","id":32741},{"urlkey":"fun-for-friends-and-their-friends","name":"Fun for Friends and Their Friends","id":44531},{"urlkey":"bootcamp-fitness-class","name":"Bootcamp fitness class","id":104576}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Healthy-Group-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>This group is for health conscious people who are looking to try different styles of training, learn helpful ways to eat healthier, and find friends to workout with!<\/p>","lon":-76.5800018311,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184325251,"name":"Suzanne Miranda","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/4\/highres_243696900.jpeg","photo_id":243696900,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/4\/member_243696900.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/4\/thumb_243696900.jpeg"}},"members":157,"name":"Baltimore Healthy Group Meetup","id":18754906,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Healthy-Group-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":39.3100013733,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437440555000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"international-adventure-travel","name":"International Adventure Travel","id":95404}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Silver-Spring-International-Travel-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This travelling group is about enjoying travelling experience together in exotic places.

Our meetings include discussions, sharing own experiences - both - as facilitators\/therapists and clients, social outings, field trips, group meditations and hypnosis. <br><\/p>\n<p>Past Life Regression Therapy is based on the theory of reincarnation. It is belief that a soul survives death to be re-born again into a new body with renewed opportunity to learn life's lessons.<br><br>This powerful tool is used by even most skeptical, conservative and scientifically inclined therapists because it works regardless of our beliefs.<br>If there are no physiological or psychological reasons for your issue, then past-life exploration would be a wonderful way to uncover memory of a past trauma. Often Past Life Regression can reveal the root cause of a present symptom. Often just the matter of uncovering those memories is enough for the symptoms to disappear on it's own.<\/p>\n<p>Some people seek this kind of therapy with hopes to improve their health. Some people desire this experience out of pure curiosity. The outcome is the same - their life change in a very positive way.

This means, exercise is still very much on the list of requirements to succeed. It can be a challenge doing this alone if it's not been a habit. It's also a challenge to motivate yourself into improving in pace and intensity over time. As a group, exercising helps everyone. It's my vision that we will be patient with those who are slower in pace, simply because we have all been there before.<\/p>\n<p>Outings: Although the main purpose of this group is to support and exercise, I believe forming friendships and learning how to exist in the world, socially, with so many dietary restrictions, is a journey we can embark on together. There will be movies, dinner, festivals, etc. Anything that gets us out and about, and re-immersed into the world, albeit as renewed beings - hopefully.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of this group is to uplift, celebrate each other's triumphs and encourage each other into taking steps that are positive and inline with embracing this new found healthier lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you will join.<\/p>\n<p>PS <br>The restrictions to join are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1) You MUST be Pre-Op Bariatric patient with a set date for surgery.<\/p>\n<p>2) You MUST be Post-Op Bariatric patient. Whether you had your surgery yesterday or 50 years ago, is of no importance. Everyone is welcome.<\/p>\n<p>3) You MUST be uplifting and be of the mindset that promotes healthier living\/being. (No Sabotagers are welcome in this group!)<\/p>\n<p>4) Paying Dues will not be required for now, but contributions towards it would be really nice to have. I'm starting this because I feel there is a great need for it.<\/p>\n<p>5) All meetup events will be focused in the Maryland (PG\/Montgomery areas); however, meetups outside these areas will occur from time to time with the consideration of having access to FREE PARKING.<\/p>\n<p>6) I am open to suggestions for meetups and will do my best to act on them immediately.

Come to the Badass Support Group! I am not a life coach and I don\u2019t have a business that would benefit from this group. My intention is purely to provide a way for badasses to meet face-to-face and support each other. The agenda of the group is simple: help other badasses with whatever goal they are working toward. Meetings could involve helping someone identify their roadblocks or maybe brainstorming ideas of what they can do to reach their goals. Everyone must remain positive, nonjudgmental, and encouraging.

Adventurous. Creative. Quirky. Unique. You're an awesome friend, but you don't always get the chance to show that. Guess what? You're not alone. I've been judged for being \"different\"--left out of groups, wondering why no one seemed to understand me or like me. And I've always wanted friendships with Black women who could look beyond stereotypes and connect with the real me. You too may want those kinds of friendships. This group is the place for that. Let's have the relationships we want. Let's be the supportive, life-loving women we want to be. Let's share our stories with women who can relate and want to have fulfilling, honest friendships, too.

Please pay your dues within 3 weeks of joining (and then by Oct 1 each year after), or you will be removed from group events (especially those where paid members are on the wait list) until you pay.

I had REAL problems so I need a REAL relationship with God. The problem was, I didn't realize I didn't have one. I thought going through the religious motions was the relationship. No one explained the why, what, and how to me&nbsp;<span>until I got to MCC.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With bible-based, life application teachings by Former Baltimore Ravens Chaplin (1999-2013), Pastor Rod Hairston, every Sunday is a \"real talk\", mind-opening experience on how to improve yourself, your World and your life for the benefit of all mankind and to the glory of God. The worship is phenomenal, the teaching is relevant, and the service is an express 75 minutes flat (Can I get an Amen)!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>I'm so blessed to have found this gem so I want to be a blessing and share it with everyone.

Gay men face common gay stereotypes and clich\u00e9s, not just from the straight world but also from our own \u201cgay community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span>By \"gay scene,\" I mean gay bars, gay restaurants, \"LGBT(Q)\" political meetings, gay pride parades, gay brunches, and drag shows. &nbsp;In the gay scene, you meet the same kinds of gay people (clich\u00e9 gays also known as \"basic gays,\" doing the same things (like going to drag shows) over and over again. &nbsp;So as a non-scene group, we do not do these things as a group. We set ourselves apart and we have events away from the scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We are also not part of \"gay culture.\" This is not a group for guys who call themselves \"queer\" or \"girl\" or who are over-the-top or provocative and who find female pop artists and fashion really important. Some gay men like rock music and sports. This group is&nbsp;for gay guys who do not act like stereotypical black females and do not think mockery of them is funny (it's actually racist), for whom camp is not their typical humor, who are not exaggeratedly feminine, and who do not frequent gay bars.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for gay guys who identify as masculine and normal. Recently, transgender men have come to dominate gay media outlets, confusing people into perceiving transgender men to be gay men. Transgender is not the same as gay. We support transgender rights, however, most gay men are not men who want to be women. We are gay and bi men who like being men.<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for gay guys who are seeking new friends to hang with, go to movies with, and have dinners with, away from the gay scene. &nbsp;I think these kinds of gay guys are the <i>majority<\/i> of gay men, but people may not perceive that to be so, because popular culture and \"gay culture\" perpetuate and reinforce gay stereotypes and cliches. &nbsp;Here is&nbsp;<span>social space that connects normal gay guys offline, in real life, at places other than gay bars, such as coffee shops, private homes, sports events, and restaurants.&nbsp;<\/span><span>Unlike the common cliche gays, we won\u2019t be wearing purple wigs in this group and posting the pics on Facebook or Meetup. We're not like that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last, this group is not about hooking up with other guys, which is also another common stereotype of gay men. Being gay is mostly not about sex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking for something different from and better than the gay scene that defines and limits so many gay guys, then this group is for you. Non-Scene Gay Guys is for gay and bi men in their 20s, 30s, and a few in their 40s, who have interests outside of gay culture and want to hang out, make friends, and have fun, doing social activities away from the gay scene.

As long as you don't mind spoilers, we want you to be there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you only read books?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not at all; we will sprinkle in movies based on books, plays, book festivals and the like to keep things interesting and provide other means to enjoy what great writing has to offer.<\/p>","lon":-77.0599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/7\/highres_441958983.jpeg","photo_id":441958983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/7\/600_441958983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/7\/thumb_441958983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":18108291,"name":"Auja Little","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/2\/a\/2\/highres_249672962.jpeg","photo_id":249672962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/2\/a\/2\/member_249672962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/2\/a\/2\/thumb_249672962.jpeg"}},"members":77,"name":"Voracious: A Foodie Book Club","id":18928072,"state":"DC","urlname":"Voracious-A-Foodie-Book-Club","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":38.9399986267,"who":"Voracious Readers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hanover","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442180188000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"landlords","name":"Landlords","id":484},{"urlkey":"property-management","name":"Property Management","id":19086},{"urlkey":"residential-income-property-owners","name":"Residential Income Property Owners","id":60994},{"urlkey":"making-money-with-rental-property","name":"Making Money with Rental Property","id":75850},{"urlkey":"rental-property-investments","name":"Rental Property Investments","id":97067},{"urlkey":"property-investors-network","name":"Property Investors Network","id":110204},{"urlkey":"property","name":"Property","id":121688},{"urlkey":"landlord-and-property-managers","name":"Landlord and Property Managers","id":143826}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Washington-NARPM-Chapter\/","rating":0,"description":"We are the local chapter of the National Association of Residential Property Managers (NARPM.org) and focus on single family residential rental management in Baltimore city and county, and Howard\/Anne Arundel\/PG Counties.

Well here's your chance! I started this group soley looking out for my Bolivian peeps, without really knowing very many of them. Born in Bolivia, but raised in Maryland, it was hard meeting people from the same heritage. This group helps us all connect in a organized way, something us Bolivians as we know aren't very good at, BUT hopefully we can change that! I run House music event's in DC. I usually have between 1-4 parties a week. I will be using my event's as an anchor\/meet up points to link everyone up. My goal is to not only meet one and another, but support each other in what we do. I would love for you all to use this group to setup other Bolivian Meet up groups to let everyone know we aren't as underpopulized as people think.

We are proud members of the Barbershop Harmony Society (officially the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of BarberShop Quartet Singing in America, Inc., or SPEBSQSA). The chorus performs a diverse repertoire of American popular music, including Tin Pan Alley classics, pop standards, novelty songs, and seasonal favorites. We complement our singing with innovative staging, movement, and dialogue, to create a unique and memorable experience for our audiences. All of our music is arranged for four voice parts and sung a cappella (unaccompanied). The male singers in our group come from various musical backgrounds, having sung in high school and college a cappella groups, madrigals, church choirs, opera, musical theater, and even heavy metal bands. We are a volunteer organization. The men who sing with us are regular guys from all professions...executives, teachers, engineers, physicians, military, skilled laborers, and more. They come from Baltimore and Washington, DC, and everywhere in between. The Sons of the Severn name is an homage to the Severn River, which runs through Annapolis, the state capital of Maryland and home to the United States Naval Academy. The chorus represents the Anne Arundel County, Maryland Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Our chapter was founded in 1949, the third chapter to charter in the Society's Mid-Atlantic District.<\/p>","lon":-76.5100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192388470,"name":"S David Bankard Sr.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/highres_249867555.jpeg","photo_id":249867555,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/member_249867555.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/thumb_249867555.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"A.A.

Lets take some time for ourselves so that we can continue to be there for others. Our professional presenters share practical information on issues from nutrition, couponing, dental hygiene, finances, conflict resolution, getting organized, women's health, resources for those caretakers of aging parents, and more. There is always a professional comedienne who closes out every meeting because laughter is good medicine and we want everyone to leave with a merry heart!

Members include women who are interested in running for elected office, women who are serving on campaigns, women who are running for office, women who are interested in Baltimore city politics  as well as those who are dedicated to promoting the election of women to public offices.\n\nThe groups objectives are to:\n\n\u2022 Enhance the skills and sharpen the techniques of women who are interested in running for public office.\n\n\u2022 Galvanize the collective support of women throughout the city to increase the number of women elected to public office.\n\n\u2022 Promote the issues of concern to women, especially those who are voiceless.\n\n- Educate ourselves in the issues of concern to Baltimore residents\n\nWe must encourage women of all ages to run for office or be part of the process. Just being silent and ignoring the political system in Baltimore is not acceptable. This group we will empower women to run for city\/county office and\/or working on campaigns.  Men outnumber women in these roles by significant margins.\n\nFact: In the 110th Congress, we had a record number of women chairing committees, but that record is still only six chairs, out of roughly 40 committees. As the pipeline to political power begins early in life \u2013 12 of the last 19 Presidents started their political careers before they were 35 years old, women often handicap themselves by not considering a run for office until much later in life than their male counterparts.\n\nJoin this meet up and let's start empowering each other to take a stand.

The first Meetup, located in Charlotte, has been very beneficial to those women in need and my desire to start one in the Charm City has now come to fruition. Join me January 16, 2016 for our first meetup scheduled alongside our one year anniversary! Look for our next meetup coming to D.C and VA - keeping my promise to establish meetups in the DMV area. Please share. We need your support!!<\/p>\n<p>Who We Are: &lt;br&gt;<\/p>\n<p>We are a group of black women coming together to support, empower and fellowship while moving forward. We will meet to share, have fun, cry, laugh and grow. We will have various events and empowerment meetings and sharing sessions. Each Villager must make a vow upon joining. It's simple, you must vow to help at least one Villager in some form or fashion while a member of the group. This could be by way of encouraging, mentoring, praying or any way you feel that inspires or brings a smile on the face of another. This group's mission is to enjoy life and each other while having fun while moving forward. *This Meetup is an extension of the Charlotte (NC) Black Women Widows Moving Forward Meetup and The Strong Black Women Grieve Blog and Facebook communities below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com\">www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>LET'S MOVE FORWARD!<\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/highres_444131677.jpeg","photo_id":444131677,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/600_444131677.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/thumb_444131677.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":104588872,"name":"Sabra Robinson","photo":{"photo_id":136301712,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/f\/0\/member_136301712.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/f\/0\/thumb_136301712.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"Baltimore Black Women Widows Moving Forward","id":19103406,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Black-Women-Widows-Moving-Forward","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Baltimore BWW Villagers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447041785000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"internet-of-things","name":"Internet of Things","id":79740},{"urlkey":"wearable-art","name":"Wearable Art","id":83650},{"urlkey":"wearable-technologies","name":"Wearable Technologies","id":454182},{"urlkey":"smart-sensors","name":"Smart Sensors","id":871222},{"urlkey":"smartwatches","name":"Smartwatches","id":1476262},{"urlkey":"smartwatch","name":"Smartwatch","id":1484772},{"urlkey":"smartbands","name":"Smartbands","id":1484792},{"urlkey":"wearables","name":"Wearables","id":1484812},{"urlkey":"pebble","name":"Pebble","id":1504263}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/D-C-Wearables-meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a place where designers, developers, bloggers and advertisers and enthusiasts meet up to talk about the latest trends and developments in the wearable technology industry.<\/p>","lon":-77.0100021362,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":16872131,"name":"manny","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/c\/0\/highres_251240928.jpeg","photo_id":251240928,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/c\/0\/member_251240928.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/c\/0\/thumb_251240928.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"D.C.

creative. Get away from your busy, over-committed life for a couple of hours and share some time relaxing, socializing and creating with other women. This is a place to explore your creative self in a fun and supportive atmosphere. All skill levels are welcome, from those who mistakenly think they are not creative to those artistic, crafty women who want to get back to creating. We will meet every Thursday evening at Catylator Makerspace, a gorgeous facility in downtown Silver Spring. Each week we will pick a project or craft to complete, such as chalk painting, jewelry making or paper crafting, based on the interests and requests from the group. Come just when a project interests you, or come every week for the fun and social aspects. We will have light refreshments, but bring your own wine :). All supplies will be included, and there will be a fee for each class which will cover materials and the rental of the space.","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185070044,"name":"kathryn neel"},"members":154,"name":"Women's Upscale Craft Studio","id":19124372,"state":"MD","urlname":"Womens-Upscale-Craft-Studio","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":39,"who":"Artists and Crafters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447620577000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-marriage-minded","name":"Christian Singles Marriage Minded","id":15378},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"divorced-single-never-married-christian-singles","name":"Divorced,Single,Never Married Christian Singles","id":25392},{"urlkey":"christian-women","name":"Christian Women","id":31382},{"urlkey":"christian-single-events","name":"Christian Single Events","id":63228},{"urlkey":"christian-dating-and-relationships","name":"Christian Dating and Relationships","id":72415},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-and-singles-again","name":"Christian Singles and Singles Again","id":103825},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-social-networking","name":"Christian Singles Social Networking","id":151244}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DMV-Single-Christian-Ladies-Network\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all Single Christian Ladies! \"As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend\" (Proverbs 27:17)...
