There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4.

Philip Winter (R\u00fcdiger Volger) is the disenchanted German journalist who is mooching across America in desperate search of a muse. While in New York, he is thrown together with cherubic, inquisitive and testy young lass Alice (Yella R\u00f6ttlander), who has been abandoned by her mother, and the pair decide to travel back to Europe with no real idea of where the road will take them. The film is full of love\/hate relationships, an idea that is physically represented by the prickly bond between Philip and Alice , but who also symbolise Wenders\u2019 own bewilderment (and wide-eyed fascination) with the architecture, advertising, music, photography and inescapable cultural-sprawl of the US.

For that matter, all legal issues are not criminal in nature. However, homicides, or really just the presence of a corpse, draw the undivided attention of insects. Actually, us, too! Humans are captivated by death, especially when foul play is suspected. Despite the reality that death due to murder, abuse, or negligence represents some of the worst actions that one human can bestow upon another, people are drawn to it. We watch intently on the news, read novels about crime and murder, and have made crime shows the top rated programming on television in the United States. So it should come as little surprise that our number one nemesis\u2014insects\u2014have the same interests that we do. Okay, insect attraction to human or any other animal remains is motivated not out of the macabre (like us), but instead as part of foraging behavior. Yes, several insect species use dead animals as their primary food source. By understanding which insects are attracted to the dead, when they will arrive, and how long they take to complete development under varying environmental conditions, these species become useful pieces of physical evidence in investigations of suspicious or unexplained deaths. Using aspects of insect biology in this deductive manner is the basis for forensic entomology, the branch of forensic science and sub-field of entomology that deals with issues in which insect and arthropod biology intersects with the judicial system. Of course the reality is that forensic entomology is much broader than just death investigations, and also includes legal aspects of insects associated with food (stored product entomology), dwellings (urban entomology), and matters of national security. By understanding the biology of necrophagous and synanthropic (ecologically associated with humans) insects, we can begin to predict why and when certain insects will become associated with human habitation, stored food, or colonizing a corpse.<\/p> <p><b>MES meeting at 8:00 pm;\u00a0Lecture begins 8:15 pm.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Location: <\/b>UMBC Bioscience Building - \u00a0Room 004 \u00a0\u00a0Find a campus map at: <a href=\"http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/<\/a>.<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Meet for Dinner before the Lectures<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in meeting for dinner before the lectures, you are invited to join the guest speaker and your fellow MES members at Kibby\u2019s Restaurant and Lounge, \u201cHome of Baltimore\u2019s Best Shrimp Salad Sandwich.\u201d Kibby\u2019s is located inside the Baltimore Beltway at 3450 Wilkens Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21229, just 15 minutes from UMBC.

Rivers, Ph.D. ,Professor, Department of Biology, and Director of the Forensic Studies Program, Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland<\/p> <p><b>Background:<\/b> My foray into entomology began as an undergraduate at Ball State University (BS in Biology) when I was given the opportunity as a freshman to work with Dr. Harold Zimmack, an entomologist specializing in invertebrate pathology. His enthusiasm for insects was infectious and quickly won me over. From there I received my Ph.D. in Entomology with an emphasis in insect physiology while working in the laboratory of David Denlinger at The Ohio State University. My thesis work was focused on behavioral, physiological, and biochemical interactions between the parasitic wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis <\/i>(Walker) (Pteromalidae) and its filth fly hosts. I jumped at the chance to do a project that no one else in the lab was doing. Importantly, all of the other graduate students and post docs in the Denlinger lab were working with sarcophagids of some sort, so my project represented an impending threat to their research.\u00a0 Thus I began my decades-long journey of working on research projects that annoyed or offended my colleagues! I completed a postdoc in the laboratory of Michael Strand at the U. of Wisconsin working with a polyembryonic wasp <i>Copidosoma floridanum <\/i>(Ashmead) (Encyrtidae), and in 1994, started as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Loyola College, now Loyola University Maryland. Since 2011, I have served as the Director of the Forensic Studies program, and just completed my second stint as department chair. My research interests are focused on fly\/wasp interactions in carrion communities, the physiology of heat production within maggot masses, and I am now in the midst of initiating a research program aimed at biological control of biting tabanids (horse\/deer flies).<\/p> <p><b>Photo:\u00a0<\/b>A mass of mostly <i>Lucilia illustris <\/i>(Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) formed in the mouth opening on the head of a dead Virginia Opossum, <i>Didelphis virginiana <\/i>Kerr (Mammalia: Didelphidae).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet in the University of Maryland at Baltimore County Bioscience Building, Room 004--one floor below street level.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/marylandnature\/events\/225948326\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Silent Witnesses: Insects as Tools in Legal Investigations","id":"225948326","time":1445040000000,"updated":1445052498000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1290469464000,"name":"The Natural History Society of Maryland","group_lon":-76.5299987793,"id":1741675,"urlname":"marylandnature","group_lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Naturalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"20715","country":"us","city":"Bowie","address_1":"6111 Columbian Way","name":"Cardinal Room at Boswell Hall","lon":-76.713417,"id":8635292,"state":"MD","lat":38.974216,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.4312763214,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444395993000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join Mandy at the LA Singles Dance in Bowie on Friday 10\/16\/2015 at\u00a0<\/p> <p>Cardinal Room at Boswell Hall<br\/>6111 Columbian Way<br\/>Bowie, Maryland\u00a0 20715<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lasinglesbwa.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lasinglesbwa.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.lasinglesbwa.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Love-Again-Singles-1522001868024312\/timeline\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Love-Again-Singles-1522001868024312\/timeline\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Love-Again-Singles-1522001868024312\/timeline\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Mandy will grab a table near the entrance and have several red balloons tied to a chair. <\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>The band is \"New Censation\"<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/newcensation.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/newcensation.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/newcensation.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLA (Love Again) Singles sponsors the largest singles dances in the DC area, catering to singles over 30 who love to dance and are interested in meeting new people in a safe and secure environment.<\/p> <p>LA Singles dances are held on Friday nights at the Knights of Columbus' Cardinal Room at Boswell Hall in Bowie, featuring a positively huge dance floor and plenty of room for everyone.<\/p> <p>One does not have to be a member of the club to attend...you can simply pay a minimal admission of $15 and come out to dance the night away.\u00a0 The dance floor can literally accommodate hundreds of dancers.\u00a0 Our last performance there had a line waiting to get in at one point, so an early arrival is recommended, particularly if you want to sit at a table, which are available on a first come first served basis.<\/p> <p>Performance hours are from 8:30 to 12:30&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.oracleband.net\/photos\/LA-Singles\/April-2010\/LA-Singles-2010-18.jpg\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.\u00a0 Doors open at 8:00 and music is playing from the get-go, so those that REALLY love to dance with a wide open dance floor are welcome to show off your best moves.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/0\/d\/600_442834061.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/4\/600_442834068.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/1\/9\/600_442834073.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Mandy will grab a table near the entrance and have several red balloons tied to a chair.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SCSCMD\/events\/225945018\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"LA Singles Dance in Bowie -

This will be prior to Halloween as I'm sure that someone will post an event for a Halloween party that weekend. For this event, I'd like to get together to watch a couple of recent American animation films that may not be as well known as their Pixar and Disney counterparts but are both still great movies. Both films will help us get into the Halloween mood and even into the pre-holiday spirit (Christmas is starting earlier every year!). The first movie is \"The Book of Life\" (2014) and the second is \"Rise of the Guardians\" (2012). Oddly enough I just realized that both films were helped produced by Guillermo del Toro.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/oi59.tinypic.com\/6pudy1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Short summary for \"The Book of Life\" (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2262227\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2262227\/<\/a>)<br\/>- In the Mexican town of San Angel, Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zo\u00eb Saldana) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been friends ever since childhood. Although their lives have taken different paths -- Maria was sent to Europe, Joaquin joined the military, and Manolo studied to become a bullfighter -- one thing remains the same: Manolo and Joaquin both want to marry Maria. Little does the trio know that battling husband-and-wife deities have made a high-stakes wager on the love triangle's outcome.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/oi58.tinypic.com\/2gx429i.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Short summary for \"Rise of the Guardians\" (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1446192\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1446192\/<\/a>)<br\/>- Generation after generation, immortal Guardians like Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) protect the world's children from darkness and despair. However, an evil boogeyman named Pitch Black (Jude Law) schemes to overthrow the Guardians by obliterating children's belief in them. It falls to a winter sprite named Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to thwart Pitch's plans and save the Guardians from destruction.<\/p> <p>So come join us for a fun, light-hearted get together. After watching these films, if you happen to attend an anime convention and see someone cosplaying a green bird-like fairy calling herself the Tooth Fairy or a cosplayer in a red dress wearing a giant sombrero on her head with hundreds of candles, you'll know what characters they are!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/baltimoregenshiken\/events\/224615471\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"PRE-halloween American Animation Movies","id":"224615471","time":1445101200000,"updated":1445113277000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1199932525000,"name":"Baltimore Genshiken - Anime, Manga, Gaming, and Cosplay Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":937363,"urlname":"baltimoregenshiken","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Otaku"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Severna Park","address_1":"Severna Park Community Center","name":"TridentCon 2015","lon":-76.544937,"id":24083103,"state":"MD","lat":39.070553,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.7182798386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444342523000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This \"session\" is for Saturday lunchtime! \u00a0Please click \"yes\" to this meetup if you're interested in a boxed deli sandwich lunch for Saturday. \u00a0I need a decent headcount (I'll add wiggle room) so I don't go overboard and get stuck with too many extra lunches.<\/p> <p>The boxed lunches are coming from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplesands.com\">Simple Sands Deli<\/a> and look delicious (this is a \"nothing but Dietz &amp; Watson &amp; Boar's Head\" kind of delicatessen). \u00a0Click \"yes\" if you're down for a lunch, and comment below if you have dietary restrictions I need to work around. \u00a0I'll get an assortment of classic combinations and we can pick\/swap as necessary. \u00a0Each boxed lunch should run $11 and include the sandwich or wrap, a small bag of chips or \"salad\" (potato salad, that sort of thing), and a bottle of water or soda. \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TridentCon-gaming-in-MD\/events\/225931929\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Saturday Boxed Lunch","id":"225931929","time":1445101200000,"updated":1445113522000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1439752132000,"name":"TridentCon: gaming in MD","group_lon":-76.4899978638,"id":18838784,"urlname":"TridentCon-gaming-in-MD","group_lat":39.3899993896,"who":"Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":21.746717453,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443830661000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Now that the fall season is upon us lets go for a tractor rid, pick some pumpkins, run through a corn maze and so much more.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

Using dogbane or stinging nettle and yucca, participants will learn several hands-on methods of achieving a strong, lasting, and neatly twined cordage. The instructors will also demonstrate other methods of making cordage in the field, such as with cambium, tree roots, and grasses, discuss the use of sinew and rawhide, and share their insights and experience about both the ideal materials to use for various purposes, as well as the necessity of being flexible and at ease with the materials that are around you.

Heavy foods can interfere with this work, especially if spiritual work is new to you. \u00a0I do encourage a light snack however, as a starving student can be equally distracted.<\/p> <p>Finally, please be on time. \u00a0We will spend the first 15 minutes sharing and learning, and then begin our first journey. \u00a0If you do arrive once the journeying has begun, be quiet and respectful, and take the time to journey for yourself.<\/p> <p>Be respectful and turn off all cell phones and pagers during the event.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wyrd-Weavers\/events\/225499470\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":9000000,"name":"Shamanic Journey Group","id":"lwxxjlytnbxb","time":1445193000000,"updated":1445204493000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1358298988000,"name":"Wyrd Weavers","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":6682212,"urlname":"Wyrd-Weavers","group_lat":39,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Towson","address_1":"9515 Deereco Road","name":"Liberatorse's Restorante","lon":-76.639763,"id":24120753,"state":"MD","lat":39.451954,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":11.2625398636,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443590556000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Let's us get together for a Meet and Greet with our new and earlier members!

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long).

So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride.

While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

The report includes wild edible greens, shoots, roots, tubers, stalks, berries, fungi, nuts, &amp; seeds, and is intended to be a complement to other study on wild edible plants, whether through classes or independent research. The report does\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0include detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Tsunami is a popular Asian fusion restaurant on Main Street with good appetizers, sushi, and a nice roomy ambience.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIn the opening pages of Jamie Ford's stunning debut novel,\u00a0<b>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet<\/b>, Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle's Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol.<\/p> <p>\n\nThis simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry's world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While \"scholarshipping\" at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship - and innocent love - that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept.<\/p> <p>Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel's dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family's belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice - words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago.<\/p> <p>Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history,\u00a0Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\u00a0is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope. In Henry and Keiko, Jamie Ford has created an unforgettable duo whose story teaches us of the power of forgiveness and the human heart.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the back of the Nordstrom Marketplace Cafe.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/columbia-meetup-book-club\/events\/226021344\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"October Book Club Meeting","id":"226021344","time":1445553000000,"updated":1445696553000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1193699468000,"name":"Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":783965,"urlname":"columbia-meetup-book-club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Towson","address_1":"111 E Joppa Rd","name":"Cinemark Towson and XD","lon":-76.600182,"id":22762632,"lat":39.401985,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.82545471191,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439955426000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Can't make it to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts?<\/p> <p>This is your chance to witness an iconic masterpiece of American dance, Alvin Ailey\u2019s Revelations, described by The New York Times as \u201cone of the great works of the human spirit.\u201d \u00a0This stunning, soulful tour de force draws on African-American spirituals, song-sermons, gospel songs, and holy blues. \u00a0The wide-ranging influences and irrepressible passion of Revelations are evident across the rest of this electrifying program, which features Wayne McGregor\u2019s sumptuous Chroma, set to a score by Joby Talbot with orchestrations of songs by The White Stripes; Ronald K.

It is Ethics applied to a group of people, and discusses how a society should be set up and how one should act within a society. Individual rights (such as the right to life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness, free speech, self-defence, etc) state explicitly the requirements for a person to benefit rather than suffer from living in a society.\u00a0 Political philosophy asks questions like: \"What is a government?\", \"Why are governments needed?\", \"What makes a government legitimate?\", \"What rights and freedoms should a government protect?\", \"What duties do citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any?\" and \"When may a government be legitimately overthrown, if ever?\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>From the Enlightenment \u2026\u00a0 These theorists were driven by two basic questions:<\/p> <p>(1)\u00a0 By what right or need do people form states?<\/p> <p>(2)\u00a0 What is the best form for a state?<\/p> <p>These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \"state\" and \"government.\" \u00a0It was decided that:<\/p> <p>(1)\u00a0 \"state\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified.<\/p> <p>(2)\u00a0 \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound.<\/p> <p>Much of the definitional material seems to focus on institutions and their structures.\u00a0 I would suggest that these are pretty well established in the US, and much of the world, and not likely to change much, no matter how much we complain.\u00a0 I would also suggest that what we citizens spend most of our political effort on is \u201cpolitical discourse\u201d, and that much of our complaining stems from problems relating directly to that political discourse.\u00a0 With those propositions I would offer the following as the operative question for the meetup\u2026<\/p> <p><b>Where does political discourse end and political philosophy begin?<\/b><\/p> <p>Proceeding from this question, the proposed strategy for the discussion is to perform a deconstructionist analysis of the elements of our political discourse using the basics of philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics) to gain a better understanding of the nature and content of political discourse, both as we, and our political leaders(?) practice it.<\/p> <p><b>The analytical tools\/framework of philosophy\u2026<\/b><\/p> <p>a.\u00a0 \u00a0Metaphysics \u2013 Whether an entity exists, or possibly exist;

professional organizer and TV host.<\/p> <p>By Monique Cuvelier<\/p> <p><br\/>Hellen Buttigieg is the embodiment of competence, strutting around messy houses with a sassy bob and an open face. She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

The workshops enable women to learn about a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities in a casual, non-threatening environment. The classes are designed to be as hands-on as possible, giving participants enough knowledge to further pursue their interests once the workshop is over.<\/p> <p>Weekend workshops begin with lunch on Friday and end with lunch on Sunday. Women who register for the weekend, are given their choice of over 30 classes in which to participate. Class offerings may include: outdoor photography, stream ecology, turkey and deer hunting, fly fishing, hiking, kayaking, outdoor survival skills, and many more.<\/p> <p>In addition to weekend workshops, we are also offering Beyond BOW events. Beyond BOW workshops last from one to three days but are focused on specific activities. Beyond BOW workshops may include a 2-day canoe trip down the Potomac River with an overnight camp out , a 1-day fishing clinic, or an outdoor survival skills weekend. Each workshop we offer is tailored to showcase the resources and opportunities available in that area.<\/p> <p>The emphasis of BOW and Beyond BOW is on the enjoyment and camaraderie that goes along with outdoor recreation, whether hunting, fishing, hiking, or boating.<\/p> <p>All of this for only $195.00.

Femworkers respect the intellectual property of others, and never share proprietary business information with anyone outside the group.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Femworking-Columbia\/events\/225800432\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"Femworking Columbia","id":"zjckllytnbfc","time":1445619600000,"updated":1445624299000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443462905000,"name":"Femworking Columbia","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":18976267,"urlname":"Femworking-Columbia","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Femworkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":9.82481098175,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426602209000,"fee":{"amount":20.5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>$17.00 to walk<\/p> <p>$20.50 to ride<\/p> <p>This MeetUp is for more advanced players as most Friday players are fairly skilled and will try and play as many holes as they can.<\/p> <p>If this is your first time with us, come to the Pro Shop and check in. \u00a0Once you pay your green fee the starter will pair you up with other MeetUp participants.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Golf-Club\/events\/225587973\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":12600000,"name":"Friday Afternoon Twilight Golf","id":"gxkfglytnbfc","time":1445630400000,"updated":1445644467000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1298627187000,"name":"Baltimore Golf Club","group_lon":-76.6500015259,"id":1789387,"urlname":"Baltimore-Golf-Club","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"TBA","name":"TBA","lon":-76.609261,"id":20978962,"state":"MD","lat":39.290581,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0.577098965645,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433703914000,"fee":{"amount":100,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>***For full details &amp; to register visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/jeremiah-johnson-primitive-weekend\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/jeremiah-johnson-primitive-weekend\/<\/a> \u00a0***<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nFriday Oct 23 \u2013 Monday Oct 26, 2015<\/p> <p>A camping, teaching, &amp; skill-share weekend for folks who are itching to get that camping gear out of the closet, get into the woods, try their hand at some new skills, tune up on old ones, and share time with some other woodsy-minded folks.<\/p> <p>You will need to bring all your camping necessities, including cookware and food for breakfasts and lunches (and snacks), and water.<\/p> <p>Materials for all the scheduled workshops will be provided, and participants are free to bring home everything they\u2019ve made from the weekend.<\/p> <p><b>***For full details, schedule, and to register visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/jeremiah-johnson-primitive-weekend\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/jeremiah-johnson-primitive-weekend\/<\/a> \u00a0***<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're camping in Flintstone, MD","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Foragers-of-Baltimore\/events\/223084990\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"2-Day Primitive Weekend \u2013 Camping","id":"223084990","time":1445630400000,"updated":1445642781000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340392286000,"name":"Foragers of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6500015259,"id":4145332,"urlname":"Foragers-of-Baltimore","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Foragers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21045","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"9130F Red Branch Road","name":"Optimum Performance Training Institute","lon":-76.818268,"id":2345101,"state":"MD","lat":39.232128,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":11,"headcount":0,"distance":11.358464241,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1354562336000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please do not RSVP for this meetup unless you have first completed the introductory program.

No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life \u2013 thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious.

To find a way, or to practice a method, implies inhibiting, controlling, suppressing thought, which is not to understand the mind. It is fairly obvious that the mind does create disease in the physical organism. If you eat when your angry, your stomach is upset. If you violently hate somebody, you have a physical disorder. If you restrict your mind to a particular belief, you become mentally or psychically neurotic, and it reacts upon the body. This all part of the psychosomatic process. Of course, not all diseases are psychosomatic, but fear, anxiety, and other disturbances of the psyche do produce physical diseases. So is it possible for the mind to be made healthy? Many of us are concerned with keeping the body healthy through right diet, and so on; which is essential, but very few are concerned with keeping the mind healthy, young, alert, vital, so that it does not deteriorate.<\/p> <p>\u201cNow, if the mind is not to deteriorate, it must obviously never follow; it must be independent, free. But our education does not help us to be free. On the contrary, it helps us to fit into this deteriorating society. Therefore the mind itself deteriorates. We are encouraged from childhood to be fearful, competitive, to think always about ourselves and our own security. Naturally, such a mind must be in everlasting conflict, and that conflict does produce physical effects. What is important, then, is to discover and understand for ourselves, through our own vigilant watchfulness, the whole process of conflict and not depend on any psychologist or guru. To follow a guru is to destroy your mind. You follow him because you want what you think he has; therefore you set going a process of deterioration. The effort to be somebody, mundanely or spiritually, is another form of deterioration, because such effort always brings anxiety; it produces fear, frustration, making the mind unhealthy, which in turn affects the body. I think this is fairly simple. But to look to another for the cure of the mind is part of the process of deterioration.\u201d<i>The Collected Works of J. Krishnamurti, vol. IX.

It's a well-maintained, wooded trail. The end, when approaching Weverton Cliffs is rocky - Weverton Cliffs is a rocky outcropping. The one mile walk from the cliffs to the parking lot entails numerous switchbacks, but downhill.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As each group finishes the hike, they'll head over to Big Cork Vineyards. Don't forget to buy your ticket online beforehand for the Big Cork festival... see info above in the meetup description.

Then, reward yourself with lunch and some wine tasting at a new, local vineyard a few miles away! It's all about balance. :)<\/p> <p><b>Hiking<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet at Gathland State Park near Burkittsville, MD for our hiking portion of the day. The Appalachian Trail stretches from Maine to Georgia, it runs more than 2,175 miles along the one of the oldest mountain chains in the world. Although only a small percentage (about 40 miles) runs through Maryland, it is arguably among the most scenic portions, with monuments dotting the trail.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/a\/7\/600_441646247.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The trail runs through Gathland State Park, once owned by Civil War correspondent George Alfred Townsend (whose nickname was Gath). There he built a journalists' memorial, a castle-like arch listing the names of reporters killed during the war listed on it. Updated plaques around the park include the names of American journalists who have died covering wars around the world.<\/p> <p>The 6-mile hike follows the Appalachian Trail south along the top of the mountain. The hike has a moderate rating for its length, but it is mostly flat with few rocky patches and nearly continuous views of the valleys below. The real treat on this hike is Weverton Cliffs, where you can take in the absolutely beautiful 180 degree panoramic view of the Potomac River as it snakes between Maryland and Virginia, with the Harpers Ferry area just visible at the very western point.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/b\/e\/600_441646270.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Note this is a one-way hike so we'll need to coordinate beforehand to leave a few cars at the end point, i.e., Weverton Cliffs, so we can get everyone back to the start point and to head to the winery (just a few miles away).<\/p> <p><b>Winery<\/b><\/p> <p>After our morning hike, we're off to Big Cork Vineyards for eats and wine tasting!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/d\/c\/600_441646300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Big Cork is nestled on 100 rolling acres in Maryland\u2019s Pleasant Valley with 13 varietals, making Big Cork the second largest vineyard in Washington County. The winery and tasting room opened a few years ago. Big Cork Co-Owner Dave Collins, formerly vineyard manager and winemaker at the award-winning Breaux Vineyards (VA), oversee the planting and on-going operations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Where encampments of Union and Confederate troops once mustered during the Civil War, bountiful fruit now grows. Bog Cork\u2019s idyllic microclimate and fertile soil yield smaller grapes with more concentrated fruits, resulting in more flavorful and aromatic wines.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As a commitment to sustaining the land, the owners are mindful of farming practices and use strategies that help improve the fine quality of the wines and create a better place to live and work.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since its launch, Big Cork has won numerous awards in multiple wine competitions. The latest awards were just last year in 2014 an, included Best of Class for the 2013 Traminette at the Long Beach Grand Cru, Double Gold for the 2013 Russian Kiss at the Indy International Wine Competition, and Best in Show for the \u201cBest Dessert\u201d Vidal Ice at the Maryland Governor\u2019s Cup.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Summary<\/b><\/p> <p>Morning hike on the Appalachian Trail at Gathland State Park, afternoon eats &amp; drinks at Big Cork Vineyards.

Our streets and stages are filled with nonstop entertainment for all ages.<\/p> <p>While jousting takes place on every day of the Festival, on this special weekend we have knights across the country join our Free Lancers jousting company in a special competition to determine who is the greatest knight in the land!<\/p> <p><br\/>------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Maryland designated jousting as the official state sport in 1962. Jousting tournaments have been held in Maryland since early colonial times and became increasingly popular after the Civil War.<\/p> <p>Retaining the pageantry and customs of medieval tournaments, modern competitors are called \"knights\" or \"maids,\" and many dress in colorful costumes. Men, women and children compete equally with skill and horsemanship determining the class.<\/p> <p>Jousting tournaments in Maryland are \"ring tournaments\" which involve charging a horse at full-gallop through an 80-yard course toward suspended rings. Using a long, fine-tipped lance, the rider has 8 seconds to complete the course and \"spear\" the rings, scoring points accordingly.<\/p> <p>In a jousting ring tournament, rings are hung 6 feet 9 inches above the ground from three equally-spaced arches (rings range in diameter from one-quarter inch to nearly two inches depending upon the skill-level of the contestant). A family sport, jousting skills frequently are passed from one generation to the next.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Go-Out-and-Do-Something-B-GODS\/events\/225854656\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":33300000,"name":"Rennfest State Sport Weekend!

Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Here's a synopsis taken from Amazon so you know what the book is about:\u00a0Does the love for a wife and the jealousy of an infant, warrant murder? After ten years of bad dates and worse relationships, Stan is in heaven, for he has finally found his soul mate, Erica\u2014a beautiful, caring woman who shares all his beliefs, to include not wanting children. They discussed this over bottles of red wine the night they met and promised, if ever they became a couple, they would remain childless and forever the other\u2019s priority. One year after being married, Erica tells Stan she\u2019s pregnant: news she\u2019s very happy about. Stan considers talking Erica out of it, but that would mean aborting her child, something he knows Erica would never do. Two months into the pregnancy, Stan notices changes: times he and Erica enjoyed as a fun-loving childless couple are no longer; Erica\u2019s attention is occupied with all things related to the forthcoming baby, and Stan has gone without sex for months. The child arrives and things get even worse; Stan feels like an outsider: a stranger living among his wife and her son. Erica gives all her time, attention and love to the infant, leaving none for her husband. Stan becomes envious; he looks at the newborn as a threat, tells himself something must be done\u2014but what? He fights his jealous thoughts, knowing horrible things would happen if he were ever to act on them. But one night while drunk, Stan attempts to make love to his wife but is once again rejected. His pride hurt and feeling disowned, Stan stumbles into the baby\u2019s room with intentions of eliminating his problem once and for all, knowing there can only be one man in Erica\u2019s life. That is the promise his wife had made him on the night they met, and it is the promise he intends to make her keep.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/20-30s-African-American-Book-and-Writing-Club\/events\/225805763\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"1st read for the book club: My Wife's Baby: I am not a Murderer by RM Johnson","id":"225805763","time":1445713200000,"updated":1445725093000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443879865000,"name":"20-30s African American Book and Writing Club","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18991616,"urlname":"20-30s-African-American-Book-and-Writing-Club","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Lutherville-Timonium","address_1":"100 E.

You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted.

Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a donation based event.

Our village is named Revel Grove, and is set on a beautiful 25-acre wooded site with 85 acres of free parking. The village consists of craft and food booths, five pubs, ten major stages, a Jousting Arena and lots of games.<\/p> <p>Every day is a Festival Day in Revel Grove, in honor of a visit by Henry VIII and his Royal Court. As such, the village will have entertainment, crafts, food, and frivolity fit for a king!<\/p> <p>The gates open at 10:00 am, but you'll want to start the day with the King's Welcome outside the front gate at 9:45am. Once inside the gates, you may want to check your program for a listing of all the shows, but part of the fun of our Renaissance Festival is taking your time to stroll through the lanes and let the experience unfold before you.<\/p> <p>Pause for a moment to listen to a musician. Watch a demonstration of glass blowing. Quench your thirst with a mug of ale and whet your appetite with a gigantic turkey leg. Pick up the latest gossip from the fishmonger. Thrill to the combat joust and then browse through the wares at one of the many fine craft booths. There's too much to do in a single day!<\/p> <p>Performers from across the North America entertain on the Festival's many stages while the streets and woods are filled with characters to amuse and delight. Watch authentic jousting in full armor, listen to music and choral groups, thrill at jugglers, magicians, and comely wenches. Our streets and stages are filled with nonstop entertainment for all ages.<\/p> <p>While jousting takes place on every day of the Festival, on this special weekend we have knights across the country join our Free Lancers jousting company in a special competition to determine who is the greatest knight in the land!<\/p> <p><br\/>------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Maryland designated jousting as the official state sport in 1962. Jousting tournaments have been held in Maryland since early colonial times and became increasingly popular after the Civil War.<\/p> <p>Retaining the pageantry and customs of medieval tournaments, modern competitors are called \"knights\" or \"maids,\" and many dress in colorful costumes. Men, women and children compete equally with skill and horsemanship determining the class.<\/p> <p>Jousting tournaments in Maryland are \"ring tournaments\" which involve charging a horse at full-gallop through an 80-yard course toward suspended rings. Using a long, fine-tipped lance, the rider has 8 seconds to complete the course and \"spear\" the rings, scoring points accordingly.<\/p> <p>In a jousting ring tournament, rings are hung 6 feet 9 inches above the ground from three equally-spaced arches (rings range in diameter from one-quarter inch to nearly two inches depending upon the skill-level of the contestant). A family sport, jousting skills frequently are passed from one generation to the next.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Go-Out-and-Do-Something-B-GODS\/events\/225857972\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":33300000,"name":"Rennfest State Sport Weekend!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\".

But as always keep the end user's (you or the clients) opinion the highest weight in that balance.<\/p> <p>In this workshop our goal is to provoke emotions and thought with \"Subject, Composition, Light, and Exposure\" for that wonderful shot. With all good results planning is needed to increase our shot success ratio. Many items make up a good image and it all starts with good communication, spiritually within the artist (don't shoot until you see it) and verbally with your subject.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our featured model will be the crazy funny Chakira, new to the The DMV Photographer Workshops but not new to some of us. Of course we will other models depending on participation. (And if the ladies sign up we will include a male model of course.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will create the scene, but the focus will be on \"parts\" of the model in the scene. (Again composition is key!) In some \"parts\" assignments photographers work with known viewers fetishes to bring out and provoke emotion for the art viewer; legs, shoes, hands, garters, handcuffs, rope, and so on. Some of these scenes will be done in our studio and outside to help give the final image the look and feel you were looking for. Then we will move into full scene story telling views, if time permits.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, here is another workshop opportunity to broaden your shooting selections while you work on becoming one with your creative balance.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/225996196\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride (MEETING AT THE ICE HOUSE)","id":"rdfpglytnbkc","time":1445981400000,"updated":1446036346000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules brokered under this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with Aviation Velo for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended.

Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research.<\/p> <p>Speaker<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/pracherla9\">Pavan Racherla<\/a>\u00a0has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on \u201cThe Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.\u201d He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]).
