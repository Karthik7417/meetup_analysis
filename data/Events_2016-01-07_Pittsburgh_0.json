Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/227006645\/","yes_rsvp_count":29,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"qwnxklytqblb","time":1449622800000,"updated":1449630896000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.9800033569,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Volleyball Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":25,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442085507000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Note: The start time is now 8:00 pm instead of 7:00 pm!

Vending machines or nearby places to get a bite to eat would be an added plus for those players who would prefer to arrive straight from work.<\/p> <p><br\/>Hampton's facility offers informal play in a clean, well-lit, facility with a ceiling suitable for executing high clear shots.\u00a0 Separate men's and women's showers and changing areas are available in the bathrooms.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The court surface is made of concrete and the official boundaries of each of six courts are clearly marked.\u00a0 On Tuesdays, we are allotted three badminton courts.\u00a0 Hampton Community Center allows us to set up a fourth court if warranted.

In this presentation I will be discussing the problems, work-flows and end-goals from the developer and security professional's viewpoint. I will discuss in depth, the pressures and business needs that often drives development cycles. We'll also be talking about the mind-set of the successful developers you can easily win over, how to do it, and how to expand this to all development teams. We Security Professionals are also not without fault. Our approach of tracking issues, and throwing tools at the problem just isn't working. I'll be talking about my experiences within different organizations, and how minor adjustments can gain wider acceptance and appreciation for security teams within the organization.<\/p> <p>It is hoped by spreading understanding what drives a developer's mindset, as well as the development process, we as security professionals can help them, and ourselves. In outlining the problem, as well as filling in the gaps for those who lack development experience, we can bring security and development onto one team.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Eric Mikulas is a reformed developer with over 15 years of professional software development experience crossing various industries. Being raised by an Electrical Engineer, and learning to solder, and read schematics before being able to cursive write, he was raised by technology and never though twice about seeing what was behind the curtain. After being promised cookies, He made the jump onto the dark side, that is security by being becoming a Subject Matter Expert for development teams who lacked the understanding to address security concerns.

For those of you came last year, thank you, and I hope you enjoyed yourselves and met some new people. You all know that my house is not enormous, but we can fit about 20 people in there, so that is what I will aim for this year. The furniture in my house has been arranged a bit differently since then, which should make socializing even easier this year.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The end time listed is just a suggestion, and showing up a little early is not a problem. Last year a few people stuck around later to play Cards Against Humanity, and some headed out earlier.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Small change: we had quite a bit of food last year.<\/i> Since I'd never planned this type of party, I wasn't sure how much to have everyone bring, so there was more than needed. This year, I'd like to suggest a few specific items we can use, and Clint and I will take care of a main dish, such as pizza. <b><i>Items we can use are mainly outlined in my comment below, but there is no obligation to bring anything.<\/i><i>\u00a0If anyone wants to have a drink, we could use wine (a red, a white, and a sparkling would be great), six-pack of beer, or a bottle of liquor.\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0The comment section can be used to let everyone know what you're bringing so we don't have too much overlap.\u00a0See my comment below to know what we're looking for and so we know what to expect so we can pick up anything needed in the days before.<\/b><\/p> <p><i>The gift exchange.<\/i> Last year, those who wanted to participate brought a gift of around $20 or less and we drew names. We then pretty much just traded items if someone had something to trade with another person that was a better fit. I think this would be a great thing to try again, and participation would be optional. This is subject to change as the date gets closer. I'll be sure to give everyone at least 2 weeks notice on how the gift exchange will work.<\/p> <p><i>Parking will once again be a challenge<\/i>. My best suggestion is to try to find a spot close to the funeral home at the corner of Dunster St. and Hartranft (along the right hand side of the street if you're traveling east on Dunster toward my house). Once you reach my house, there are too many driveways to have any spots to park in, and parking is not permitted on the side of the street my house is on. Last year, some people parked on the streets parallel to Dunster where they could find spots.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If walking is an option, parking is also plentiful at Moore Park, but the walk is up the hill to Dunster St., then turn left and walk down the street about three blocks, so about 1\/3 mile from the park to my house. Moore Park is on the left if you're going south up the hill on Pioneer Ave (coming from Liberty Tunnels) before you get to Dunster St, and would be on the right past Dunster St if you're driving North on Pioneer Ave (in the direction of the Liberty Tunnels). I suggest as a last resort.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Any questions or comments, send to my Meetup inbox or to [masked].\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lets-End-Isolation-caused-by-depression-anxiety-etc\/events\/225345285\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":12600000,"name":"Let's Have A Christmas Party At Amanda's House!","id":"225345285","time":1449963000000,"updated":1450088351000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411172933000,"name":"Let's End Isolation caused by depression, anxiety","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":17099012,"urlname":"Lets-End-Isolation-caused-by-depression-anxiety-etc","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15207","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh 15213","address_1":"One Schenley Park","name":"Phipps Conservatory","lon":-79.949791,"id":11892872,"state":"PA","lat":40.434441,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.4620912075,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448389399000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head to the dazzling winter light show at Phipps on Sat., Dec 12th.

Although some of the commentary is too deep for our purposes, everyone should read it and decide what portion, if any, relates to her and possibly volunteer to propose a topic and take the lead for future discussions.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0I'd like to defer the topic about Purpose to later in 2016, as it is also the last Trigger in the book \"Happy Women Live Better\" by Valorie Burton, which was the basis for this group, and which we did not fully discuss. For this meeting, I'd like to go back to Happiness Trigger #1 \"Anticipation\" and focus on the joy that the Christmas season can provide, if we work at it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe topics under holiday coping in the link generated some sadness for me because of all the family members and friends I can no longer celebrate with due to death or distance. But I want to halt that sadness and create a joyful December, by fondly remembering the many good times, while finding ways to renew the spirit of joy -- and the reason for the season -- with the hope that joy will continue throughout 2016, and that we will always have something to excitedly anticipate.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSo, I will start the discussion by sharing what I am anticipating to be a \"Happy Thanksgiving\" in a few days (and how that turned out), plus one of my favorite December family gatherings. And then open the floor for each person to also share. My hope is that we all will leave the meeting uplifted through happy memories -- and with suggestions and the anticipation to experience some of the great holiday activities that appeal to you individually; that nourish your soul; rather than the stressful hustle and bustle. \u00a0And if you are looking for someone to share those activities with, perhaps someone in the group will also be interested. I personally want to find easy access to performances, see lights and decorations, browse through gift displays, watch movies, read books, and also find quiet time to appreciate and reflect on this special season.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nMany of us are gathering on 12\/6 for a \"holiday brunch and shop event\" at Sweetwater Arts in Sewickley, where we might find some $10 treasures for the 12\/13 grab bag exchange at the end of the meeting. So remember to bring a festively wrapped gift to create anticipation for the receiver. Each person will draw a number. The person drawing number one will select her choice from the gift display; then number two will choose, etc. Once all the gifts are handed out, we might try to \"anticipate\" what might be in the package, then open them all at once, and go home with a delightful memory of the day.

At the heart of this sprawling, dizzying debut from a quirky, assured Australian writer are two men: Jasper Dean, a judgmental but forgiving son, and Martin, his brilliant but dysfunctional father. Jasper, in an Australian prison in his early 20s, scribbles out the story of their picaresque adventures, noting cryptically early on that [m]y father's body will never be found. As he tells it, Jasper has been uneasily bonded to his father through thick and thin, which includes Martin's stint managing a squalid strip club during Jasper's adolescence; an Australian outback home literally hidden within impenetrable mazes; Martin's ill-fated scheme to make every Australian a millionaire; and a feverish odyssey through Thailand's menacing jungles. Toltz's exuberant, looping narrative\u2014thick with his characters' outsized longings and with their crazy arguments\u2014sometimes blows past plot entirely, but comic drive and Toltz's far-out imagination carry the epic story, which puts the two (and Martin's own nemesis, his outlaw brother, Terry) on an irreverent roller-coaster ride from obscurity to infamy. Comparisons to Special Topics in Calamity Physics are likely, but this nutty tour de force has a more tender, more worldly spin.

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

Fun! Fun for everyone!<br\/>Let's all get out and dance with appreciation and celebration and playful gatheration, for the sweet mama cacao who feeds pure knowing from her center! Nourishment! How often do we take the time to appreciate the nourishment that the earth provides? And honestly...who wouldn't want to do it with raw, vegan, *chocolate*? ;) Raw cacao has been called \"the food of the gods\" for centuries, and we know why. When we consume raw cacao, we enter into a greater sense of consciousness that uplifts and expands our human hearts! When we do it consciously, with reverence and gratitude for these gifts...well...we'll just have to find out :) So let us come into the playful, loving spirit that is raw cacao and get down to a awesome drum beats and improvise in pure joy, pure love, and pure liberation. That's what it's all about!<br\/>We'll be having an improvisational ceremony with song, dance, drum and any instrument that anyone feels like bringing to celebrate cacao, and everyone will get to learn and make a recipe for raw chocolate that is literally to live for! It's delicious and healthy, too! A lot of folks feel isolated around the holidays. We feel almost stuck, like no one is around us. But you want to know something? We aren't! Isn't that amazing news?<br\/>Aren't we so blessed? For those folks who are without a place to go and be around family, it can super suck. We want to offer a space where you can come and be connected in community around the holiday season.<\/p> <p>We are so grateful for you and we want to see your shining face in our beautiful space at East Carson Street where we are practicing being together in genuine, authentic community where we can be ourselves and play. This is all about letting out the inner sillies and being kids! So let's come out on the 17th of december from 6pm-9pm, and let our inner children out to play :) This event is kid-friendly.

The vast majority of American citizens are unaware that the framers, who understood that a law is only as good as it's enforced, implemented a check and balance for such a situation as well. <b>Fortunately, our system of government gives the power to the County Sheriff to either ignore or enforce Federal law. Neither the President of the United States, the U.S. Congress nor the U.S. Supreme Court can tell the County Sheriff what to do in his or her own county.<\/b><\/p> <p>The County Sheriff is elected by the people, not employed by any branch of the government. Because he\/she takes an oath to uphold the Constitution\u00a0for the United States, his\/her loyalty is towards protecting freedom. He\/she decides which laws are Constitutional and will be enforced and which laws violate his\/her constituents' rights and will be ignored. For the choices he\/she makes, he\/she will answer directly to the residents of his county, not the federal government. Ultimately, the County Sheriff is the check to balance any overreaching authority of the federal government, and is thus the last line of protection against any and all intrusive actions and legislation.<\/p> <p>The Sheriff Project is designed to educate resident volunteers\u00a0as to what they may rightly expect from their County Sheriff and how to determine if their Sheriff is fulfilling his\/her oath to the U.S. Constitution. If the Sheriff is not, the residents, as the Sheriff Project, develop an action plan to either cultivate a relationship with their Sheriff or remove him\/her from office. They stand with their Sheriff and do everything possible to aid him\/her in defending their freedoms and promoting peace, security and constitutional law within the boundaries of their county.<\/p> <p>For more information, see:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/sheriffmack.com\/index.php\/sheriffs\/19-sheriffs\/13-the-sheriff-more-power-than-the-president\">The Sheriff - More Power than the President<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/alleghenysheriffproject.weebly.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/alleghenysheriffproject.weebly.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/alleghenysheriffproject.weebly.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are usually in the back room where the back door is.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RonPaul2012PGH\/events\/227386611\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Allegheny County Sheriff Project Study Lesson (1st & 3rd Fridays)","id":"rgqnllytqbxb","time":1450483200000,"updated":1450495263000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179688578000,"name":"Ron Paul for President 2012 - Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":506522,"urlname":"RonPaul2012PGH","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Patriots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1 Allegheny Ave","name":"Carnegie Science Center","lon":-80.017372,"id":23626200,"lat":40.446075,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.91701841354,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449635732000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carnegiesciencecenter.org\/programs\/adult-programs-21-plus-night\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.carnegiesciencecenter.org\/programs\/adult-programs-21-plus-night\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Join us for our annual 21+ Holiday Party!

Hmmm.... No, I think you have all been too naughty to expect any of that. But how about this for a holiday treat? We will gather around once more for the last event on Western PA Gaming's 2015 calendar. It's not as long as all 12 days of Christmas, but it is 10 hours of gaming, and what could make a happier holiday season?<\/p> <p>We are having another Saturday gaming event at the Market District Express with the closest thing we have to St. Nick -- jolly ol' Redbeard!<\/p> <p><br\/>Please accept our apologies for being unable to find an organizer team member to staff a Saturday meetup on December 12th, which the pattern up to now would have predicted. Busy time of year for many folks, Redbeards included.<\/p> <p>It was a surprisingly well attended event on the Saturday of November 28th. Nine of us turkeys flew in and out of the event, scratching out what fun we could find in the time we could spare. Games played included Roll for the Galaxy with the Ambition expansion, Champions of Midgard, Codenames, Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilding, Pandemic: The Cure, Istanbul, Cloud 9, Bang! The Dice Game, and I believe some diehards stayed on to knock out one last game of Cabo. We had novices and some hard-boiled gamers, Some games being taught by the patient folks that volunteer for the duty, and lots of fun all around.<\/p> <p>So bring a game you want to try, or come try some games that you likely won't find in the toy aisle at Wal-Mart. These games come from all over the world. We have a group of folks who are usually excited to teach someone a new game, and we have people who are very game (sorry) to give any games that you may bring a shot. Experienced? Inexperienced? In between? Need a little coaching to get through your turn? Ready to give it a shot? Come out and see us! Drop in any time after Noon. People come and go all day. Some don't even RSVP. There is no admission to attend. There is a rather good selection on food as well, and for those who would enjoy a beer, they do have it on site. We'll be playing in the dining area. The dining area and food preparation services both shut down at 10 PM, even though the convenience store area of the building remains open until 12 AM.<\/p> <p>And thanks once again for spending your free time with us all 2015 long! We'll be back in the new year. If you have ideas for venues and towns to hold an event, please do contact me. We know there are a lot of towns that hope to game that we are missing on the map.<\/p> <p>Text me with your questions here on meetup, or on my cell (724)[masked] . new number for me<\/p> <p>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a safe and Happy new year to one and all.

In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. \"In the Heart of the Sea\" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. The film also stars Tom Holland (\"The Impossible\") as young seaman Tom Nickerson, and Brendan Gleeson (\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\") as the same man, 30 years later.

And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.<\/p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA<\/b>, writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND<\/b><\/p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King\u00a0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.<\/p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"<\/p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"<\/p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:<\/b><\/p> <p>Click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationallibertyalliance.org\/\">www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org<\/a>, read the\u00a0home page and\u00a0view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5.

A hit at the Berlin Film Festival, the film extends the earlier shadow puppet style of Ocelot\u2019s Princes and Princesses, with black silhouetted characters set off against exquisitely detailed Day-Glo backgrounds bursting with color and kaleidoscopic patterns \u2013 the subtle use of 3D creating a diorama-like effect. The film weaves together six exotic fables each unfolding in a unique locale, from Tibet, to medieval Europe, an Aztec kingdom, the African plains, and even the Land of the Dead. In Ocelot\u2019s storytelling, history blends with fairytale as viewers are whisked off to enchanted lands full of dragons, werewolves, captive princesses, sorcerers, and enormous talking bees \u2013 and each fable ends with its own ironic twist.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/227189611\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":12600000,"name":"Sembene Film Festival Screens Tales of the Night","id":"227189611","time":1451154600000,"updated":1451168119000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15228","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1500 Washington Road","name":"Carmike Galleria 6","lon":-80.050346,"id":8088792,"state":"PA","lat":40.357605,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.40944671631,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450995087000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A poignant tale, starring Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel, of how we each find passion in life.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists).

By doing this, the people will move our courts back to \u201cCourts of Justice\u201d and take back 100% control of their government.<\/p> <p><b>THE DUTY OF THE <\/b><b>COMMON LAW GRAND JURY<\/b> <b>is to right any wrong.<\/b> If anyone\u2019s unalienable rights have been violated, or removed, without a legal sentence of their peers the grand jury can restore them. And if a dispute shall arise concerning this matter it shall be settled according to the judgment of the grand jurors, the sureties of the peace.<\/p> <p><b>IN A US SUPREME COURT STUNNING 6 TO 3 DECISION JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA<\/b>, writing for the majority, confirmed that the American grand jury is neither part of the judicial, executive nor legislative branches of government, but instead belongs to the people. It is in effect a fourth branch of government \"governed\" and administered to directly by and on behalf of the American people, and its authority emanates from the Bill of Rights and <b>has the power to enforce law and remove people from office<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>GRAND JURY BACKGROUND<\/b><\/p> <p>When the American colonies separated from England, King\u00a0George retaliated by revoking the charters. Technically, the colonies were without any legal authority to operate. However, civics (the branch of political philosophy concerned with individual rights) was generally taught and known by the people who asserted their rights and maintained order by applying the common law. The people united in the form of common law grand juries and continued the functioning of government.<\/p> <p>As the legislatures matured they slowly increased governmental power while simultaneously reducing personal sovereign power. This was done through a combination of passing pro-government legislation and reducing or eliminating education about civics. Today, two and a quarter centuries later, hardly anyone even knows the meaning of the word, \"civics.\"<\/p> <p>Despite the fact that the state and federal constitutions still acknowledge the common law as the ultimate law system, people everywhere are conditioned to believe that the statutory law and codes are the only source of law. The only remaining common law term generally known among the public is \"common law marriage.\"<\/p> <p>The common law grand jury is now dormant only because of the public ignorance of its powers that supersede all other government entities, including the modern statutorily defined grand jury.<\/p> <p><b>WHAT TO DO NEXT:<\/b><\/p> <p>Click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationallibertyalliance.org\/\">www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org<\/a>, read the\u00a0home page and\u00a0view the video \"The Power of the Grand Jury\" on that page.

Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players.

Together we deliver the future of healthcare by caring for the community who represent our individual well being for the sake of the generations to come.<\/p> <p>Description<\/p> <p>Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People or TRFCP, is a community based service concerning individuals unable to afford or have easy access to holistic healthcare. Developed to support our elders who represent our roots and traditions, warriors who represent and defend our nation, \"tree\" women who represent the diversity of women who struggle through sexual, physical, mental and emotional abuse, and children in need, who represent our future and inspiration.<\/p> <p>The vision of TRFCP is supported by Herbalist's without Borders, The Union Project and Ola's Herb Shop who have collaborated with the understanding that the importance to provide this kind of space to support all members of the community is paramount. All people reflect our individual selves, therefore our societal health. In addition, access to holistic health interventions are not always accessible and available to everyone, yet are traditionally and scientifically proven to be highly effective forms of healing from which many can benefit.<\/p> <p>The clinic will be available once a month and individuals will sign-up or have scheduled visits (particularly groups coming from a facility or organization).<\/p> <p>Current days are every first Wednesday of the month, hours 1-7p.<\/p> <p>Expect to be supported by volunteer practitioner(s) of holistic health who may provide botanical therapy, meditation, Reiki, intuitive counseling, yoga, massage therapy, reflexology and much more depending on the needs of the people and the practitioners who have volunteered their services for that day.<\/p> <p>It is our hope that all forms of donations, through service, volunteer work or financial bases from interested members of the community, will sustain this vision because it is forseen to create a paradigm shift in community healthcare and delivery for the sake of us all.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/227430963\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Potology Sessions at the Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People - NEW LOCATION","id":"psckklyvcbjb","time":1452103200000,"updated":1452135407000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Market Square","name":"The Yard ","lon":-80.00249,"id":24098599,"lat":40.440372,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.44335174561,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445909339000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/6\/4\/600_445486180.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join\u00a0Ad2 Pittsburgh\u00a0and\u00a0Pittsburgh Ad Fed\u00a0for Juice from 5 p.m.-??
