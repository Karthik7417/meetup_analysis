To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment. You are different every time you walk into the room; so is the group and so is your teacher. Therefore, each class holds completely unique possibilities.

It\u2019s about connecting to life in its purest form \u2014 breath. It\u2019s about the union of your mind, body, and spirit. My amazing teacher calls laughter yoga, \"THE HAPPINESS WORKOUT\" and says that it is a form of \u201cedu-tainment\u201d designed to relieve stress and cultivate joy through a fun mix of mind-body exercises. All it takes is an open mind and a willingness to let go. Your body doesn\u2019t know the difference between spontaneous and induced laughter. So, even forced laughter produces endorphins and decreases cortisol\u2014instant benefits for your mood and stress levels. Before you know it, fake laughter turns into real guttural belly laughs. That\u2019s when the really good stuff gets released! Doing that on a regular basis actually re-wires your brain toward positivity. Benefits of Laughter Yoga Good Mood and More Laughter: Laughter Yoga helps to change your mood within minutes by releasing certain chemicals from your brain cells called endorphins. You will remain cheerful and in a good mood throughout the day and will laugh more than you normally do. Healthy Exercise to Beat Stress: Laughter Yoga is like an aerobic exercise (cardio workout) which brings more oxygen to the body and brain thereby making one feel more energetic and relaxed. Health Benefits: Laughter Yoga reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system.You will not fall sick easily and if you have some chronic health conditions, you will heal faster. Quality of Life: Laughter is a positive energy which helps people to connect with other people quickly and improves relationships. If you laugh more, you will attract many friends. Positive Attitude in Challenging Times : Everyone can laugh when life is good, but how does one laugh when faced with challenges? Laughter helps to create a positive mental state to deal with negative situations and negative people. It gives hope and optimism to cope with difficult times. How does Laughter Yoga work? Most of the Laughter in a Laughter Yoga session is initiated in the group with full body laughter exercises, clapping, eye contact and youthful playfulness. The \"simulated\" laughter soon turns into real, spontaneous and contagious laughter that brings much more oxygen to our body and brain, lifting our spirits and carrying over into our work, school and social lives. We will also end with a chocolate yum meditation. Dr Kataria who is the brain child behind laughter yoga says the 5 benefits of laughter yoga are : 1. Good Mood and more laughter 2. Healthy Exercise to beat stress ( and who couldnt use a little less stress in their life) 3. Health benefits ; lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. Help beat depression, chronic pain issues ...the possibilities are endless 4. Quality of life improves, you are able to connect with people more and on a more true and intimate level 5. Positive in Challenging times **All this just from laughing!** Come once or come every week for this amazing experience.

Each evening is unique and will sometimes feature invited guest facilitators from the 5Rhythms or other disciplines. Come meet like minded explorers while you get in touch with your self in a safe, fun, sacred space. (These events are an extension of Doug O'Brien's \"Trance Nights\" and meet on or about the seasonal equinoxes and solstices. Other \"Trance Nights\" are more storytelling and contemplative trance oriented.)","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12173836,"name":"Doug OBrien"},"members":149,"name":"New York Hypno-Dance Experiment Meetup","id":18514332,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Hypno-Dance-Experiment-Meetup","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Hypno-dance explorers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"River Edge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426982592000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"politicalcafe","name":"Political Cafe","id":3334},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"localpolitics","name":"Local Politics","id":8867},{"urlkey":"enlightenment","name":"Enlightenment","id":16906},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"political-activism","name":"Political Activism","id":19690},{"urlkey":"youth-mentoring","name":"Youth Mentoring","id":22998},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement","name":"Civic Engagement","id":37181},{"urlkey":"social-and-political-activism","name":"Social and Political Activism","id":80680}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bergen-Activists\/","rating":0,"description":"Bergen Activist supports and mentors men in and near Bergen County age 18 to 30 by teaching activism, civic engagement, and the lessons of the enlightenment.","lon":-74.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185445287,"name":"Joseph Dunsay"},"members":20,"name":"Bergen Activists","id":18514410,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Bergen-Activists","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.9300003052,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426982971000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"anthropology","name":"Anthropology","id":1403},{"urlkey":"socialscience","name":"Social Science","id":10846},{"urlkey":"sociology","name":"Sociology","id":15030},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"strategy","name":"Strategy","id":31810},{"urlkey":"ethnography","name":"Ethnography","id":317651},{"urlkey":"social-and-cultural-anthropology","name":"Social and Cultural Anthropology","id":740602}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HiddenInPlainSight-TacklingProblemsWithLiberalArts\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) was borne of a desire to foster dialogue between anthropologists and the non-academic world.

As domains like medicine, technology, and marketing face dramatic cultural changes, these counter-corporate points-of-view are coming into the fore in ways that are more influential than ever. HIPS explores the current and future applications of the behavioral and social sciences to solve real-world problems through monthly meetups and online publications. HIPS also serves as a resource for organizations to find researchers and strategists for projects and for social and behavioral scientists to collaborate, fine tune their work, and help drive the changes that industry, academia, and society at large need.<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/4\/d\/highres_435471533.jpeg","photo_id":435471533,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/4\/d\/600_435471533.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/4\/d\/thumb_435471533.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":111169132,"name":"Vyjayanthi Vadrevu"},"members":161,"name":"Hidden in Plain Sight-Tackling Problems with Liberal Arts","id":18514419,"state":"NY","urlname":"HiddenInPlainSight-TacklingProblemsWithLiberalArts","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"HIPSters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426995283000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"botany","name":"Botany","id":738},{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"ethics","name":"Ethics","id":1768},{"urlkey":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","id":15998},{"urlkey":"urban-design","name":"Urban Design","id":16199},{"urlkey":"aesthetics","name":"Aesthetics","id":24783},{"urlkey":"posthumanism","name":"Posthumanism","id":32810},{"urlkey":"sustainable-development","name":"Sustainable Development","id":47570},{"urlkey":"architecture-theory","name":"Architecture Theory","id":47955},{"urlkey":"urban-farming","name":"Urban Farming","id":79173},{"urlkey":"critical-urbanism","name":"Critical Urbanism","id":1505166},{"urlkey":"cultural-ontology","name":"Cultural Ontology","id":1505167}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SnRM-para-architecture\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>SnRM, the tin room,<\/p>\n<p>is a Jersey City\u2013based studio that is&nbsp;<span>committed to advancing architectural discourse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>SnRM hosts events like lectures, charettes and exhibitions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We want to meet up with anyone who is passionate or even curious about architecture, urbanism and other diverse associated topics. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/6\/c\/highres_435593868.jpeg","photo_id":435593868,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/6\/c\/600_435593868.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/2\/6\/c\/thumb_435593868.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":185449877,"name":"SnRM|para-architecture"},"members":9,"name":"SnRM","id":18514595,"state":"NJ","urlname":"SnRM-para-architecture","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Folk"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426996655000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"project-planning","name":"Project Planning","id":44239},{"urlkey":"brainstorming-ideas","name":"Brainstorming Ideas","id":51152},{"urlkey":"small-business-branding","name":"Small Business Branding","id":788012}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/remembermenyc\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>Our Philosophy:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our job is to tap ideas that move you to take action.

Our brain tapping experiences are designed to make you feel part of something bigger so you can share what you already know, express it, and turn it into something you will be proud of.

The World Celebrationist Society and its community organization, the United Celebrationist Movement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The World Celebrationist Society offers services in advocacy for the abandoned and embattled, support in sponsoring and organizing celebrations of all types, offering financial aid to those in need and working to support segments of society which might be neglected.<\/p>\n<p>Our organization&nbsp;works toward a society of greater understanding and acts toward cultural contribution and learning for the sake of a more understanding and tolerant world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The WCS also recruits and trains a version of public ministers, known as advocates. These individuals minister on behalf of Celebrationist philosophy to all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, history or status. We strive to offer a home, be it spiritual or otherwise to anybody that might want one or might feel like they don't have one elsewhere. We gladly offer both spiritual and non-spiritual ritual services such as weddings, funerals, humanistic counseling or even basic human company in a person's time of need. The World Celebrationist Society also offers services in assisting people in finding a spiritual home outside of Celebrationism if they feel like our philosophical element isn't quite the right fit. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Registered members of Celebrationism pay an annual $59.00 contribution and enjoy voting privileges, rights to serve on the Celebrationist Council or Chancery, free classes related to religion, philosophy, culture and free admission to WCS public events and celebrations around the world. All dues collected from registered members go toward our missions and operational costs. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The UCM<\/p>\n<p>The UCM is the World Celebrationist Society's free community organization that brings people who adopt the teachings of Celebrationism and the Pillars of Faith that we're built on. These community get togethers are meant to unite people in celebration, service and unity on the back of the Celebrationist Pillars of Faith. These organizations are sponsored and managed by the World Celebrationist Society to promote community celebration, interfaith unity and public service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The World Celebrationist Society proudly hosts UCM Meetups around the United States and England. We're currently recruiting regional organizers to help organize UCM events in local communities in both countries. We are also recruiting candidates to be ordained as Celebrationist advocates throughout the world.

Even still, for others, we are a project of intercommunal relationship and movements of spiritual discovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our purpose, quite plainly, is to create a more vibrant, tolerant, and understanding world.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to meet this goal by championing ideas of goodness.&nbsp;The World Celebrationist Society is the home of all people regardless of who they are, where they're from or what is in their history.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to serve as the unapologetic champions and advocates of all persons. We embrace members without exclusion in the spirit of compassion, forgiveness and the promotion of growth and progress. We celebrate in tribute to our bountiful existence and each element which contributes to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the ideas that we teach are organic within us, but are not always easily fulfilled. Working through education, service, advocacy, celebration, support and exploration to fulfill and promote these good notions is our mission.<\/p>\n<p>Some choose to find the strength to meet these purposes with the aid of spirituality, others don't. Our organizations welcomes both groups of people. We do this simply because the operations that bring us further into goodness are inconsequential, for it is the goodness that is most imperative to sustaining the health of the world and offering comfort to its people.<\/p>\n<p>Every member of Celebrationism and its governmental body of service, the World Celebrationist Society, are encouraged to celebrate in their own individual way, in their respective forward journey of growth. In this idea comes great diversity in how each element of our mission and teachings are interpreted, and in many ways, that is quite precisely what we're all about. This visionary project is a tribute to that very spirit of complex diversity in humanity and the layered nature of individuality, with a respect for the common bonds that bring us together, in recognition of all the boundless potential, wonder and goodness that is &nbsp;inherent to our existence.<\/p>\n<p>We help realize these ideas through a special observation of the promotion of growth, positive gesture, philosophical action, celebration and active appreciation for the abundant wonders of our existence, both in the slightest nuance and the most blatant display of greatness - be it in nature, human achievement, art, sport, experience, gesture or anything else.<\/p>\n<p>We celebrate in silent, private appreciation and in open festivals of dedication and honor. We teach the importance of inclusive acceptance, forgiveness and personal growth, and we do it all in the spirit of celebrating the life we have the privilege of learning from, pleasuring in and in journey to a more richly happy life for all those burdened and blessed by this very experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit us at www.ucm.center<\/p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/highres_435866147.jpeg","photo_id":435866147,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/600_435866147.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/thumb_435866147.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":175339562,"name":"Michael"},"members":26,"name":"The United Celebrationist Movement - New York","id":18519228,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-United-Celebrationist-Movement-New-York","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Celebrationists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427264208000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"scifi","name":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy","id":317},{"urlkey":"cosplay","name":"Cosplay","id":640},{"urlkey":"comics","name":"Comic Books","id":794},{"urlkey":"manga","name":"Manga","id":2849},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"geek","name":"Geek Culture","id":10493},{"urlkey":"birthday-parties","name":"Birthday Parties","id":15375},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"japanese-anime-cosplay","name":"Anime Cosplay","id":30363},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"geeks-nerds","name":"Geeks & Nerds","id":32623},{"urlkey":"anime-conventions","name":"Anime Conventions","id":52002},{"urlkey":"anime-and-cosplay","name":"Anime and Cosplay","id":65769}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>Anime fans &amp; Super Smash Bros (Wii U) fans unite!

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo"},"members":23,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language.

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

NOW YOU CAN! BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE RITE MINDSET. Welcome to the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training Meetup. This free meetup will show you how to transform your life for the better by way of learning how to bring out your inner warrior. THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE IS TO RELEASE YOUR INNER WARRIOR. My goal is to help people generate the energy and the mind-set necessary to become Warriors in Entrepreneurship. I am an Online Marketing mentor, Motivational Speaker and the mastermind behind the Mushindo Mind-set. I created the Mushindo Mind-Set to help bring out the inner Warrior in all hard-core Entrepreneurs. Through my study of both business and martial arts, I have honed my understanding of what it takes to get what you really want out of life. Education is only one part of the equation, however. I have now turned my knowledge into power by implementing powerful strategies from world-renowned authors such as Miyamoto Musashi, Bruce Lee, Robert Kiosiki, Napoleon Hill and many others into my own life and career. Now, my goal is to give life-changing knowledge and super-human skills at the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training. By implementing The Law of Attraction principles, Martial Arts Philosophy, and all-powerful Alchemic thinking I can teach anyone with a desire for a better life how to attain it by culling their inner Warrior. Come meet my team of qualified pros and be a part of this amazing life-changing seminar to truly become a Successful Entrepreneurial Warrior.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","members":50,"name":"ENTREPRENEURIAL WARRIORS","id":18526772,"state":"NJ","urlname":"WARRIORWITHIN","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Entrepreneurial Warrior"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hicksville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427764119000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"psychics","name":"Psychics","id":1523},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"channeling","name":"Channeling","id":16069},{"urlkey":"mediumship","name":"Mediumship","id":16603},{"urlkey":"psychic-medium","name":"Psychic Medium","id":17622},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"intuition","name":"Intuition","id":18371},{"urlkey":"psychic-spiritual-matters","name":"Psychic & Spiritual Matters","id":22548},{"urlkey":"psychic-healing","name":"Psychic Healing","id":25653},{"urlkey":"psychic-development-readings","name":"Psychic Development & Readings","id":30359},{"urlkey":"psychic-awareness","name":"Psychic Awareness","id":50742}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Healium\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for people who love helping others but don't take themselves too seriously.

I am launching The Last Minute Gourmet, right now and we are in prelaunch trying to build up a following (can't have events with 4 people showing up lol) The Single Gourmet, is mostly weekend dinners and the demographic trends on the higher side around 50+. The Last Minute Gourmet will be 90 percent midweek dinner events and a younger demographic than the Single Gourmet (but since we are pre-launch, I need to get some running ground by partnering with my current group). Being in pre-launch, I am offering some great discounts to new members that have NEVER been offered in our 33 years, which are free dinners if you sign up for full membership and dinner credits for inviting friends to become members. I also have a dinner group on facebook with over 600 members, that I will try to merge into The Last Minute Gourmet events soon. What i found with my facebook group is that people are non committal and collecting money for dinners is not easy. What I learned from The Single Gourmet is that you have to have a real set business to make dinner events really work and a membership base to make people accountable to their actions to other members and accountable to their RSVP. &nbsp;The Last Minute Gourmet will be s<\/span><span>ecret, after work, last minute dinner events texted and emailed to members.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each event has a 45 min cash bar before the dinner, a price fix menu and is prepaid, so you do not split checks, nor worry about what others are eating\/drinking.

People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

Sometimes members are encouraged to add any history or trivia they learned from the book and they even share good drink pairings.

Join me and a wonderful group of friendly, non-judgmental men for some shopping at the Grand Army Farmers Market, followed by a picnic in Prospect Park. This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!). This is all about building a cool community, meeting new people, being supportive, eating local, quality food and kicking off the weekend with some positivity. Why not avoid the brunch wait, and instead come enjoy the sun, fresh air, and good company? See you there!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/2\/d\/9\/highres_437181209.jpeg","photo_id":437181209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/2\/d\/9\/600_437181209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/2\/d\/9\/thumb_437181209.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":110349472,"name":"Jon

The Toastmaster is the Master of Ceremonies and leads us through the rest of the agenda.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a typical agenda:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Introductions: Each person briefly introduces herself or himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Agenda review: An experienced member explains what happens in the different parts of the meeting for the benefit of newcomers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Word of the day: A member presents us with an unusual word, defines it, uses it in several sentences, and challenges us to use it during the course of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Table Topics: An experienced member reads from a list of prepared questions and calls on members of the audience to give one-to-two minute responses. The questions aren't difficult; they are intended to give us a chance to practice speaking without preparation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Prepared Speeches: Two or three members deliver speeches that they have prepared in advance. These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting. Club officers make reports and club policies are sometimes discussed. \u2022Voting: We vote for the best impromptu speech during Table Topics, the best prepared speech, and the best evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Final Go-Around: We go around the room and each person briefly gives us feedback about the meeting.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","members":178,"name":"Greenspeakers\/Toastmasters Public Speaking Club Meetup","id":18541743,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greenspeakers-Toastmasters-Public-Speaking-Club-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Parsippany","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428698358000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"forextrading","name":"Forex Trading","id":8431},{"urlkey":"futures-trading","name":"Futures Trading","id":16268},{"urlkey":"currency-trading","name":"Currency Trading","id":16269},{"urlkey":"technical-analysis","name":"Technical Analysis","id":17232},{"urlkey":"stock-trading","name":"Stock Trading","id":17234},{"urlkey":"equities-trading","name":"Equities Trading","id":19268},{"urlkey":"stocks-and-options","name":"Stocks and Options","id":19809},{"urlkey":"stock-investing","name":"Stock Investing","id":22016},{"urlkey":"options-trading","name":"Options Trading","id":24425},{"urlkey":"stock-market-trading","name":"Stock market trading","id":24472},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Trading-and-Investing-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Traders and investors of all experience and skill levels who are actively involved in stocks, options, futures, commodities, currencies or other major financial markets.

If I help you, you'll help me and we will both benefit as a result. Networking requires commitment. The most successful chapters of BNI are comprised of participants who are sincerely committed to helping one another through networking. They are a team. As a participant in BNI, you are responsible for complying with the policies and guidelines of the organization.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/7\/5\/highres_436594421.jpeg","photo_id":436594421,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/7\/5\/600_436594421.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/7\/5\/thumb_436594421.jpeg"},"join_mode":"closed","members":12,"name":"BNI Chapter 17 - Referrals in Motion NYC","id":18551191,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Chapter-17-Referrals-in-Motion-NYC","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Nanuet","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1429261200000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"bike","name":"Bicycling","id":579},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"fun-afternoon-m-f","name":"Fun Afternoon M-F","id":16916},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-City-Cycling-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling out all casual riders looking for casual rides that would like to ride during the week and on weekends as a small group.

We'll always have food and drink of course, to fuel it all.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/b\/a\/highres_436696826.jpeg","photo_id":436696826,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/b\/a\/600_436696826.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/b\/a\/thumb_436696826.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":150333772,"name":"Jeremy Epstein"},"members":98,"name":"The New York Food Meetup","id":18563052,"state":"NY","urlname":"nyfoodmeetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Food Enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1429983727000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"personal-training","name":"Personal Training","id":18628},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camp","name":"Fitness Boot Camp","id":20087},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Beccas-Healthy-Brooklyn-Life\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in learning how to live and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

We have a particular interest in fostering positive community among--and assimilating insights and wisdom from--individuals with past or present experience of mental health issues and extreme states. (The term&nbsp;\"extreme states\u201d is used here to recognize alternative modes of awareness that are not necessarily understood as health problems by those experiencing them.)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>PROPELLER aims to offer two types of programming: \u201cnon-support groups\u201d (for people with past or present experience of mental health issues or extreme states) and mental wellness-related advocacy opportunities (which will be open to all who are interested).<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>\"Non-Support Groups\":<\/i><\/p>\n<p>PROPELLER \u201cnon-support groups\u201d eschew the problem\/problem-solving focus of traditional support groups, attempting instead to&nbsp;cultivate wellness&nbsp;by cultivating positive forces&nbsp;such as community, connection, creativity, and fun. This is done through the offering of (what we at least hope to be) interesting and engaging communal activities that can be appreciated on their own terms. To be clear, we are all for people talking about their experiences with mental health issues\/extreme states in our \"non-support&nbsp;groups\". It is just that in these groups we focus on creating the SAFETY to talk, rather than any sort of PRESSURE or EXPECTATION to.<\/p>\n<p><i>Advocacy Opportunities:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>PROPELLER aims to one day facilitate mental wellness-related advocacy projects with the goal of addressing issues that significantly impact people's mental and emotional well-being. You might be thinking, \u201cdon't all significant issues impact people\u2019s mental and emotional well-being?\u201d. Well, basically, yes. PROPELLER does not aim to limit itself to a particular set of issues, but rather to approach whatever issues people are interested in in a way that starts and ends with the psychological\/emotional impact on human beings. This could mean taking on projects with a fairly obvious connection to mental wellness such as advocating for the inclusion of lessons on stress management in school health curricula. It could also mean taking on projects that involve researching the psychological and emotional aspects of, for example, climate change (what is it like to be a young person in Bangladesh who knows that their country will be underwater within their lifetime?), creating some sort of media about what we find, and distributing it at, for example, a relevant demonstration.<\/p>\n<p>PROPELLER is still relatively young and has a ways to go before offering the number and variety of events we would like to. So far most of our offerings have been creativity-oriented \u201cnon-support groups\u201d in Brooklyn. Some examples of activities we have offered\/plan to offer in these spaces include: non-graffiti street art, audio collage + noise jam, dada poetry, \u201cExquisite Corpse\" (surrealist drawing game), original origami, and outdoor structure and sculpture building in Prospect Park.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that when we begin hosting advocacy-type events we plan to schedule them in conjunction with the \u201cnon-support groups\u201d, making it easy for people with past or present experience of mental health issues or extreme states to take part in extended experiences that foster deep community, connections, purpose, and empowerment. We believe this arrangement would also strengthen the advocacy projects by attracting more people to them, and specifically by attracting people withrelevant insights, wisdom, and&nbsp;lived experiencesaround matters of mental health, wellness, and extreme states.<br><\/p>\n<p><span><i><b>Join the group to stay in the loop about upcoming events as we work to fulfill our vision and offer more events at more locations around the city!<\/b><\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><i>NOTE: The number of people we know are interested in the advocacy opportunities has a direct impact on when these events will start happening.

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit. You will be free to control your future because of your fitness level rather than being confined and restricted by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/highres_438394699.jpeg","photo_id":438394699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/600_438394699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/thumb_438394699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186822598,"name":"Jim Goldfuss"},"members":41,"name":"Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT)","id":18572613,"state":"NY","urlname":"Long-Island-Fitness-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430583604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"city-exploration","name":"city exploration","id":18942},{"urlkey":"explore-local-area","name":"Explore Local Area","id":30535},{"urlkey":"city-walks","name":"City Walks","id":113737},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-york-city","name":"Exploring New York City","id":131810}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/City-Explorers\/","rating":0,"description":"Group for those interested in walking around in the city in new places, discovering new things.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":115796622,"name":"Katie "},"members":419,"name":"City Explorers","id":18573217,"state":"NY","urlname":"City-Explorers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430585976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"small-business-online-marketing","name":"Small Business Online Marketing","id":84796},{"urlkey":"business-plans","name":"Business Plans","id":114893},{"urlkey":"winning-business-plans-and-strategies","name":"Winning Business Plans and Strategies","id":370031},{"urlkey":"business-plan-financials","name":"Business Plan Financials","id":923262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SCORE-NYC-Business-Mentoring-and-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"SCORE NYC offers affordable workshops in a wide range of small business topics.

I passed up so many opportunities because people around me that I currently know either don't have the money or the time or both, to travel.

I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F. Being able to work from anywhere in the world is one of the greatest benefits the Internet can provide for you.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>_______________<\/p> \n<p>Please join our group and meet us for social gatherings to share online marketing ideas, business opportunities, traffic generation techniques, or simply just to mastermind and socialize.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><i>\"To associate with other like-minded people in small purposeful groups is for the great majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction\"<\/i> ~ Aldos Huxley<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/highres_439170983.jpeg","photo_id":439170983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/600_439170983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/thumb_439170983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183873918,"name":"Meidee Lim"},"members":176,"name":"New York Online Business & Entrepreneurs Meetup","id":18583893,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Online-Business-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Online Marketers & Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431115527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Webinars\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To thrive in today's economy, you need knowledge.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned.

The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value.

So working with the Moon provides us with an opportunity to take the time to create SACRED SPACE for ourselves. It\u2019s necessary. There is something so powerful when women come together to support each other on their journey, in the hopes and dreams. We are healed, we are nurtured, we feel comforted and understood. Moreover, when you share sacred space with other women, you magnify the power of your intentions and you energetically create a web of support for not only your circle of women friends but with women everywhere. There is no judgment or criticism present. We are able to listen wholeheartedly to what each woman has to say, holding her in support and compassion. A circle also allows that everyone within it, is equal. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honored, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.
