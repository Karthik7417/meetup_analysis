The result may look terrible, but in some instances may create an interesting effect.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Intentional blur might achieve an impressionistic ambiance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are many kinds of blur: lens blur, motion blur, panning\/zooming blur, filter blur (Vaseline, hairspray, stockings, cling wrap, etc.), each lending its own look and characteristics. \u00a0You can also create blur though enhancement software.<\/p> <p>Blur offers many opportunities for producing extraordinary images and which blur to use will depend of your own preferences. Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons, consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate.<\/p> <p>For example, blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look at the subject matter, lighting, colors, shapes, and textures, and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image. Blur can be an effective way of achieving this.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Online event, no actual meeting.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghphotomeetup\/events\/224894179\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"SEPTEMBER 2015 Photo Contest: BLACK & WHITE","id":"224894179","time":1441080900000,"updated":1441092934000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1252253514000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Photo Safari Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9800033569,"id":1519036,"urlname":"pittsburghphotomeetup","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Internet","name":"Online Event","lon":-79.995888,"id":10137112,"state":"PA","lat":40.440624,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.15937662125,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440607500000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Monthly Theme album is an online submission album.\u00a0 Read the monthly theme and then submit photos that fit the theme ALL MONTH LONG online.\u00a0 There is no formal meetup for this album.<\/p> <p>Interpret the theme as you wish.

I created this game during my junior year at IUP. The best way to describe the game is that it's a mix between Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee but we use a ball that's about 45\" in diameter. We played it every week for 2 years on the practice soccer field. There is no physical contact with other players permitted but you can use the ball however you want. Any part of your body can touch the ball and there's no height limit on the goals. Also, NO CLEATS OR SPIKES ALLOWED!<\/p> <p><br\/>To see a video of this game in action from 3 years ago, check it out here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=deBQzfRsBg0<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>We will be playing this game at Junction Hollow Field, off of Second Avenue a bit past the Hot Metal Bridge.<\/p> <p>Here are some more details &amp; rules.<\/p> <p>Field size we need is about 60 - 70 yards based on how many players we get (best games are at least 7 vs 7)<\/p> <p>There are 3 lines that matter in the game...the goal line on each side and the line at the center of the field. There are no out of bounds lines on the sides of the field.<\/p> <p>Players can dribble, roll, kick, throw or carry the ball for 3 steps<\/p> <p>The goals are 12 feet wide and there is no height limit on the goal. The game relies heavily on defense. There are also no regulations for goalies or a goalie box. This means your goalie can play mid field if he wants or you can even have 3 goalies...they can even piggyback on each other to be \"taller\" if they want. You just lose those additional players in the field<\/p> <p>Both teams start the game and after each goal at mid-field. The team that wins the coin toss or just got scored on start with the ball. As soon as anything crosses mid-field (the ball OR one of your players that's getting a running start) the other team is allowed to cross the line and start playing defense.<\/p> <p>As mentioned above, there is no physical contact with other players but you can use the ball however you want. If you're in the process of taking your 3 steps you can plow people over with the ball. If someone is charging you, you can kick the ball at them, you can hit people with the ball...I just prefer you don't aim for the head.<\/p> <p>If you do actually blatantly contact someone you get a warning and a 2 minute penalty. Second offense in the same game gets you ejected from the game. This only happened once in 2 years of playing as the ball does a good enough job of not getting players TOO close to each other...<\/p> <p>The ball is built like an exercise ball but it's VERY heavy. I would strongly advise players not try to punch the ball while it's in the air, hit it with one arm or kick it with your feet as it could easily result in an injury or twisting of the body. On that note, it's easiest to \"kick\" the ball with your knees or thigh, hit it with two hands punching close together or hit with the forearms while hands are clenched at the fists.<\/p> <p>We sometimes have players get into a \"scrum\" around the ball and it doesn't move for a while. If that happens and the ball doesn't move for 3 - 5 seconds we'll have a jump ball from where the \"scrum\" took place.<\/p> <p>Games are normally played until 11 and we switch sides of the field when one team scores 6. We usually take a little half-time break at that point too.<\/p> <p>We have had many girls play the sport and they loved it. \u00a0A few of them even had trouble picking the ball up but they still loved the game. Some of them were actually our most die-hard players.<\/p> <p>We normally start every game kicking and throwing the ball in a circle to get everyone warmed up for how big and heavy the ball actually is<\/p> <p>The game is actually the most fun in the rain because of our most important rule...<\/p> <p>NO CLEATS OR SPIKES OF ANY KIND! All players must wear tennis shoes or some other kind of non-grip shoe so they don't have any advantage in the dirt or grass. That's the way we've always played and I feel that makes everyone very even when it comes to maneuverability on the field. You can only imagine what some rain, puddles and slick grass add to a game where no one has traction. Good times.<\/p> <p>Join us on Thursday, September 3rd at Junction Hollow Field in Squirrel Hill for a game of Big Ball. \u00a0Just show up to the park to play and bring some friends. \u00a0Don't forget the number one rule...No SPIKES!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"You can't miss the big green ball that we'll be playing the game with.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SPORTSNUTS\/events\/224951486\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":5400000,"name":"Big Ball - Junction Hollow Field","id":"224951486","time":1441319400000,"updated":1441326440000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1253995150000,"name":"SPORTSNUTS of Pittsburgh Sports League & Social Club","group_lon":-80.0699996948,"id":1530362,"urlname":"SPORTSNUTS","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"SPORTSNUTS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15216","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"2950 W Liberty Ave  Pittsburgh, PA 15216","name":"Dormont Library","lon":-80.035957,"id":16440832,"state":"PA","lat":40.394169,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.93455410004,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432679295000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a traditional Hatha class taught with a vinyasa flow.

It is often a requirement for the development process to include unit testing of code when developing it and Team Foundation Server can be configured to ensure unit tests have been created and run successfully prior to checking in the code.<\/p> <p>User Interface testing, however, is typically left to the end of the development cycle and performed manually by human testers following scripts to enter data, click buttons and interrupt results. This type of testing is, of course, limited to the availability and skills of those performing the tests and can be tedious and error prone. Fortunately, when implementing an ASP.NET MVC solution there is a way to automate the UI testing so tests can be run frequently, repeatedly and consistently to identify defects and prevent regression errors. In this article I\u2019ll use TestStack\u2019s Seleno framework to demonstrate how automated UI testing can be implemented and incorporated into a project.<\/p> <p>About Mark<\/p> <p>Mark is a professional developer with over 18 years of experience in full lifecycle software development, from analysis and requirements gathering to deployment and deployment.

The question is central to normative debates<br\/>about the rights and duties of citizens in a democracy, and to contemporary policy debates in a variety of<br\/>countries over what actions states should take to encourage electoral participation. By focusing on a rare<br\/>case of abolishing compulsory voting in Venezuela, this study shows that not forcing people to vote<br\/>yields a more unequal distribution of income. The evidence supports Arend Lijphart\u2019s claim, advanced in<br\/>his 1996 presidential address to the American Political Science Association, that compulsory voting can<br\/>offset class bias in turnout and, in turn, contribute to the equality of influence.<br\/>Refreshments will be provided.<br\/>For more information contact: Anibal P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n at [masked] or<br\/>Luz Amanda Hank at [masked]<br\/>Sponsored by the Center for Latin American Studies and the Department of Political Science at the<br\/>University of Pittsburgh.<\/p> <p>For more information, visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ucis.pitt.edu\/clas\/sites\/www.ucis.pitt.edu.clas\/files\/september15_calendar.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ucis.pitt.edu\/clas\/sites\/www.ucis.pitt.edu.clas\/files\/september15_calendar.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/225036020\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Pitt Lecture: Compulsory Voting and Income Inequality\u201d","id":"225036020","time":1441828800000,"updated":1441841722000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15090","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Corner of Pearce Mill Road and Babcock Blvd.","name":"North Park Lake","lon":-79.997032,"id":6642862,"state":"PA","lat":40.597488,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":9.16686534882,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434577259000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Course Fee","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>You must register on&lt;a&gt;\u00a0llbean.com\/pittsburgh&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0prior to attending this event.

To be completely honest, one of the methods we are about to implement is so exciting I can't wait to share it with everyone! The cost to our organization to use this method is nothing, we can partner with other organizations (in fact, the more organizations we partner with, the more each organization will earn), and even the volunteers that actively participate in the campaign will earn money too! I know it may be a little hard to believe, but there are socially responsible corporations out there that have programs designed to give a portion of their profits back to non profit organizations. You'll be surprised and excited about many of the programs and methods that exists! I can't wait to share some of them with you all. Please bring paper and pen to take notes.

But in the cases in question, the probabilities of guilt or culpability are apparently very high\u2014high enough to meet the relevant standard of evidence. This problem is known as the 'proof paradox'. An oft-expressed position is that legal verdicts should be based on 'specific' rather than 'general' evidence of guilt. But despite considerable academic debate, it remains unclear whether a position along these lines can be defended, and if so, whether the problem with general evidence is ultimately moral or epistemic in character. We argue that, all other things being equal, moral considerations should not influence the import of legal evidence. Moreover, the most promising epistemic distinction between specific and general evidence does not warrant downgrading the latter in a legal trial. Finally, we argue that, in the problem cases, the probabilistic inferences are, after all, wanting. We explain this in terms of 'meta-uncertainty', and suggest a rethinking of the roles for, and relationship between, specific and general evidence.<\/p> <p>For more information: visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pitt.edu\/~pittcntr\/Events\/All\/ALS\/als_2015_16.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pitt.edu\/~pittcntr\/Events\/All\/ALS\/als_2015_16.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/224896394\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Pitt Ctr of Philosophy of Science Lecture Series: Crime, Punishment & Evidence","id":"224896394","time":1441999800000,"updated":1442011718000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Canonsburg","address_1":"580 McClelland Rd","name":"Kings Family Restaurant","lon":-80.150963,"id":18043902,"state":"PA","lat":40.256481,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.1915283203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441072844000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Greetings Everyone!<\/p> <p>Another great meetup last Friday night that unfortunately I had to miss but Redbeard graciously filled in for me as host. \u00a0<\/p> <p>It looks like they played several games of No Thanks! and Dixit. \u00a0After a few more people arrived they broke into several groups and played Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilder while the other table played Timeline: Discoveries.

Greg was the 2012 <i>Order of the Hat<\/i> award recipient from the Fly Fisher\u2019s Club of Harrisburg, an honor given to an individual for contributions to the conservation of natural resources and fly rod angling.<\/p> <p>During this presentation, <b>\u201cMayflies: Their Identification, Biology, Behavior, and Imitation for the Flyfisher\u201d,<\/b> Greg will discuss what a fly fisher\/fly tyer needs to know about some important species of mayflies that emerge from trout streams.<\/p> <p>He'll discuss accurate identification of the immature and adult life stages of these key mayfly species. Greg will include discussions on their habitat requirements, biology and behavior, and importance as indicators of water quality.<\/p> <p>Having more than 50 years of experience at the fly tying vise, Greg will also discuss how to tie some effective patterns for these mayfly species. During this lecture Greg will include some suggestions for fly fishing tactics with effective patterns designed to imitate various life stages of these important trout stream inhabitants. A period of informal questions and answers will occur during and follow the presentation. Greg's educational programs are designed to be informative for both the beginning fly fisher as well as for those with many years on the water.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/f\/5\/600_441263029.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-pwwtu-org\/events\/224849458\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Monday September 14, 2015 - September Membership Meeting","id":"224849458","time":1442271600000,"updated":1442312910000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347488264000,"name":"Penns Woods West Trout Unlimited, Pittsburgh Chapter of TU","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":4903052,"urlname":"www-pwwtu-org","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Fly fishermen, Fly fisherwomen"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15216","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1000 Kelton Ave","name":"Keystone Oaks High School","lon":-80.03451,"id":1080982,"state":"PA","lat":40.388942,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.16492080688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440089537000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You need not be a swimmer, come exercise in the pool.<br\/>Monday and Wednesday Evenings<br\/>Choice of class time for your convenience<br\/>7pm OR 8 pm<br\/>8 week session-16 classes with an extra FREE bonus class at end of session.<br\/>$55.00 session-which equals out to $3.40 a class!<br\/>Walk-Ins welcomed at $7.00 per class BUT Meet Up Members get a discounted price of $5.00 mention meetup<\/p> <p>\n\n\nfrom frank the admin: this is a good class.

Carnegie Mellon University start-up MellonHead Labs will explain water quality issues and what part can we can play in the water economy.<\/p> <p>Dave Speer, president and co-founder of MellonHead Labs will speak about: Water quality issues facing Pittsburgh and the nation, how CMU is involved and water and environmental programs, how these programs function and are supported\/funded, and the future of water quality monitoring, technology, and IoT (internet of things).<\/p> <p>CATTfish was created by the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. The CATTfish system provides a simple and easy way to track water quality at home.<\/p> <p>In 2014, a new venture, MellonHead Labs, was formed to bring this innovative environmental sensing product to market. The sensor is used by both citizens and industry to track water quality changes over long periods of time and large geographic areas.

If she's ruined everything.<\/p> <p>That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It's not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she's been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts. . . .<\/p> <p>Is that what she's supposed to do?<\/p> <p>Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/7\/b\/600_441281595.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","why":"We love to read, drink wine and talk about books!","how_to_find_us":"Ask at the Host Stand for the Book Club","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club\/events\/223774177\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Shadyside Meeting - Landline by Rainbow Rowell","id":"drdjlfytmbtb","time":1442356200000,"updated":1442368451000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1179772522000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Chick Lit Book Club","group_lon":-80.0699996948,"id":507383,"urlname":"Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club","group_lat":40.5,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1 Pennwood Ave","name":"CC Mellor Memorial Library","lon":-79.885231,"id":24072751,"state":"PA","lat":40.432266,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.29746437073,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441383580000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please join us!

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What to Expect:\u00a0<\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Facility Information:<\/b>\u00a0Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What's included in the price?<\/b>\u00a0Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Questions?<\/b>\u00a0Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Through this initiation ceremony students are opened to the flow of Reiki energy which provides an energetic shift, causing healing energies and intuitive insights to emerge. The initiation opens innate healing channels, enabling students to immediately tap into the flow of Reiki energy and perform healing sessions. In addition to learning the Reiki method of healing,\u00a0students also experience an acceleration in their spiritual awareness and intuitive abilities\u00a0as a direct result of the Reiki initiation. After learning Reiki, students report having increased energy, self-awareness, personal charisma, peace, and compassion.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Topics covered in Reiki Level I :<\/i><br\/>\u2022 What is Reiki and how the Reiki energy works<br\/>\u2022 The history of Reiki<br\/>\u2022 How to channel Reiki energy for self-healing and the healing of others<br\/>\u2022 Hand positions for self-healing and healing others<br\/>\u2022 Self-healing techniques for expanding personal awareness and accelerating wellbeing<br\/>\u2022 Hands-on practice both giving and receiving Reiki sessions<br\/>\u2022 Reiki and spiritual growth<\/p> <p>Class Duration: 6 hours<\/p> <p><i>Reiki Level I includes a Reiki Level I certification.

more people are member of our Meetup group, Facebook page and email list than come out to our events every week (and often twice a week.)Perhaps the no-shows think it's too early or that they will get engaged later, when Pennsylvania's primary heats up. \u00a0Here is evidence that it does matter now, from two newspapers that covered our around 20 Bernie folks who came to the Labor Day Parade.<\/p> <p>\"As Vice President Joe Biden left a Downtown stage at the Pittsburgh Labor Day Parade, he stopped to acknowledge Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters in the crowd, giving two thumbs up. \u00a0Biden didn\u2019t officially voice his support for Sanders, but spoke to parade attendees about the importance of the steel industry and his views on the rising cost of college tuition \u2014 a topic Sanders is known for supporting.\u00a0...<\/p> <p>\"Robert Beckwith, a member of the organization Pittsburghers for Bernie, came to the parade hoping to find blue collar support.<\/p> <p>\"Beckwith stood on the side of the parade, carrying a sign saying \u201cBERNIE SANDERS,\u201d his shirt adorned with pins in support of the candidate.<\/p> <p>\u201c[The parade] is an opportunity to reach people who can connect to Bernie, because laborers can relate to his love for the workers of America,\u201d Beckwith said.\" \u00a0Pitt News \u00a09\/7\/15<\/p> <p>\"...As he dashed in gray trousers and a white polo shirt through this Democratic bastion, Mr. Biden repeatedly encountered vocal supporters of Senator\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2015\/05\/01\/us\/elections\/bernie-sanders.html?inline=nyt-per\">Bernie Sanders<\/a>, the Vermont independent who has emerged as Hillary Rodham

from the sidewalk.<\/p> <p>\"When he approached the Sanders backers, Mr. Biden offered only praise for the senator, calling him \u201ca friend.\u201d<\/p> <p>\"And in his remarks after the parade, the vice president brought up the Vermont senator\u2019s name without prompting, saying Mr. Sanders was \u201cdoing a hell of a job.\u201d Mr. Biden made no mention of Mrs. Clinton. \u00a0... \u00a0NYTimes 9\/7\/15<\/p> <p>We were also mentioned in reports from the CBS and ABC affiliates and our people were interviewed by reporters for national CBS and NBC.<\/p> <p>Of course, much of the

This parish was formed in 1868 for the growing Oakland community between downtown and the Strip District to the west and East Liberty to the east.\u00a0St. Agnes served the parish for 75 years until it was sold to the Sisters of Mercy at Carlow University.<\/p> <p><b>St. Agnes <\/b>church was designed by the famous Pittsburgh architect John Theodore Comes. It is designed in the Lombardy style that was copied from churches in France and Spain. This tapestry brick, stone and concrete edifice sits at the top of the long Fifth Avenue descent into Pittsburgh.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The stained glass windows designed by Pittsburgh designer George W. Sotter and the richly painted murals painted by Cincinnati native Felix B. Lieftuchter are breathtaking. The high altar, side altars, communion rail and baptistery are executed in creamy marble with mosaic inlay accents by New York sculptor Henry Schmitt. Look at the unique and detailed fa\u00e7ade of the church. The central wheel window has a Calvary group sculpted into it! And the tympanum over all three entrance doors is exquisitely detailed.

Catherine\u2019s particular concern for women manifested itself in her efforts to help women to recognize their inherent dignity, to become self-directing and self-sustaining. Education was at the heart of this effort as was a desire to meet needs not being addressed by others. When the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Pittsburgh in 1843, their first ministries arose from the needs presented by this burgeoning city \u2013 education and health care. Saint Mary\u2019s Academy and the Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh (now UPMC Mercy) were established within two years of their arrival. In the late 1920s, another need presented itself \u2013 the lack of baccalaureate level education for the Catholic women of the city. After consultation with the bishop and the heads of the already existing institutions of higher learning, the Sisters of Mercy founded Mount Mercy College (now Carlow University) on September 24, 1929.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thus, with this event, we'll be celebrating mass at St. Agnes while also recognizing both the founding of Carlow University and\u00a0 founding of the Sisters of Mercy in the U.S. -- and all right here in Pittsburgh!\u00a0<\/p> <p>As we think back to 1843, and the leader of the first Sisters of Mercy group, Mother Frances Warde, who remained in Pittsburgh for seven years and then set out to found 100 convents, hospitals, schools, and social service agencies.\u00a0 Her biographer says that \u201cno woman has lived to whom the Church in the U.S. owes more than it does her\u201d.\u00a0 Though she was only in Pittsburgh for seven years, when the city celebrated its bi-centennial, the Western Pennsylvania Historical Society named her one of the 10 most influential women in the history of the city.<\/p> <p><b>Ample Parking <\/b>is located at two adjacent lots to the left and right of the church along Fifth Avenue and Robinson Street.<\/p> <p>One restroom is located in the church vestibule (not ADA compliant).<\/p> <p>However, please note that there is not an ADA entrance available to this church (a few steps enter into the priests sacristy side door).<\/p> <p>Carlow University <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carlow.edu\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carlow.edu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.carlow.edu\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>To learn more about the history of the Sisters of Mercy, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sistersofmercy.org\/about-us\/our-history\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sistersofmercy.org\/about-us\/our-history\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.sistersofmercy.org\/about-us\/our-history\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>And here is an interesting article from the Post Gazette discussing the history\/chronology of the Sisters of Mercy as well as Mercy Hospital <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/business\/businessnews\/2006\/09\/21\/UPMC-Mercy-A-chronology\/stories\/200609210367\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/business\/businessnews\/2006\/09\/21\/UPMC-Mercy-A-chronology\/stories\/200609210367\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/business\/businessnews\/2006\/09\/21\/UPMC-Mercy-A-chronology\/stories\/200609210367<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Greetings to everyone ...<\/p> <p>Just to let you know, there will be a pre-Mass tour of St. Agnes at 6:15 this Sunday, given by our own historian, David.

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What to Expect:\u00a0<\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Facility Information:<\/b>\u00a0Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What's included in the price?<\/b>\u00a0Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Questions?<\/b>\u00a0Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The PittsburghTennis staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the PittsburghTennis staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pittsburghtennisleague.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket.

\u00a0<\/p> <p>The evening started off with a kind of an Indiana Jones explorer type of theme. \u00a0We played a quick game of <b>Escape: the curse of the temple<\/b> which is a quick ten minute dice chucker coop where we got slaughtered! \u00a0<\/p> <p>Then the group sat down for a five player game of the <b>Relic Runners<\/b> that had the players exploring temples for different types of ancient relics and trying to score the most points. \u00a0<\/p> <p>After Relic Runners we pulled out of my collection one of my new games called <b>Stockpile <\/b>this game also plays five players and it's a stock market trading game with unique mechanic where each player has a certain piece of insider information. \u00a0Fast Eddie cornered the market with the electric company stock which managed to split once and increase its value substantially and wound up winning the game by about 30,000 dollars.<\/p> <p>After finishing Stockpile we had a some players leave and some new new players join in the fun. \u00a0Eddie introduced us to a game called <b>Cabo. \u00a0<\/b>After\u00a0trailing\u00a0most of the game I had thought I had pulled out a remarkable upset victory until Eddie pulls manages to hit this obscure rule where if you score exactly 100 points your score is halved back to 50 points and he ended up winning the game. \u00a0Fun little card game that I might have to pick up for the family to play.<\/p> <p>I still have a couple of new games that I haven't manage to play yet that I would like to get on the table to include: \u00a0New York 1901, La Granja, and King of New York. \u00a0I am also looking to get Francis Drake or Concordia back to the table soon but open to play most games.

And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists). We'll be meeting at Coffee Tree Roasters from 7pm (to probably 9pm though the room's booked until 10pm).<\/p> <p>This event is also posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetin.org\">meetin.org<\/a>.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Inside Coffee Tree at 7pm, head to the glass-walled meeting room in the back.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/PGH-Coffee\/events\/225128945\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":10800000,"name":"Coffee Loves Music","id":"225128945","time":1443222000000,"updated":1443235005000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1228323462000,"name":"Coffee Shop Group","group_lon":-79.9300003052,"id":1331994,"urlname":"PGH-Coffee","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Coffee & Tea drinkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15222","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"(412) 456-6666","address_1":"719 Liberty Ave","name":"Benedum Center For the Performing Arts","lon":-79.99923,"id":674836,"state":"PA","lat":40.44261,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.21327733994,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438636008000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/5\/600_440520501.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>JERSEY BOYS is the Tony\u00ae, Grammy\u00ae and Olivier Award-winning Best Musical about Rock and Roll Hall of Famers The Four Seasons: Frankie Valli, Bob Gaudio, Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi.

If you RSVPed \"Yes\" and later decided to not come, please change the RSVP to \"No\" so the first member on the waiting list can get your spot.<\/p> <p>3. Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

We will honor Ceres, a Roman Goddess of Agriculture who oversees not only the harvest, but all aspects of the growing season. She plants and nurtures the seeds, blesses the crops, and gathers the harvest safely into the storehouse to nourish us through the coming winter. Autumn Equinox is a time to give thanks for all we have harvested this year physically, spiritually and emotionally. We also acknowledge those things that have held us back-the things that do not nurture our growth that we want to leave behind us. We celebrate those things that nourish and strengthen us, and gather them in to sustain us through the dark half of the year. Please bring:<\/p> <p>-Individual offerings to Ceres celebrating the literal harvest and\/or your personal harvest-fruit, flowers, etc from your gardens, food you have prepared from your bounty, art, crafts, etc that represent your success over the past year.<br\/>-A chair for the ritual [the ritual room has benches along the walls, but you may be more comfortable in a chair]<br\/>-A dish to share for the potluck as we celebrate together the fruits and bounty of the Earth.

If you choose to drink, please drink responsibly.<\/p> <p>Parish Hill is an enclosed and heated space located on Walter Road in North Park in northern Allegheny County.

Please remember, even a dollar can help make the difference between having our costs covered and Grove Members having to pay them out of our own pockets. Support your local Druids! Sassafras Grove also supports Animal Friends' Chow Wagon Program. During these tough economic times the last thing a family needs is to have to give up a beloved pet.

So when you RSVP, please indicate if you'll bringing one or more friends.<\/p> <p>This event costs only $15\/person -- please bring cash at the door -- and is BYOB wine. The $15 includes complimentary appetizer sampling created by Executive Chef Josh Ross of Pan plus a complimentary 'follow up' beginner class voucher for your use at PDC after this event.

Her professional life is busy, but Tess lacks roots. She has no family except a usually absent mother, and her friendships tend to be superficial. Then the impossible happens. Tess is named heir to one half of an estate in Archangel, a small town in Sonoma County, California. The other half goes to a sister Tess never knew she had. Suddenly, she has family, and she\u2019s not sure how to deal with it.
