There will also be time for sharing, discussion and journaling after each meditation to deepen your experience and learning, and to socialize at the end. You're encouraged to bring a journal or notebook and pen.<\/p>\n<p>We practice meditation not to get better at meditating; rather, to get better at living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy. We meditate to connect to our best self and all the inner resources and wisdom available to us, and, of course, to experience the deeply relaxed, pleasurable states that arise with it.<\/p>\n<p>You can bring your own spirituality to your meditations. The paradigm I will offer through the meditations and our discussions is based on the premise that we are all one energy and non-physical Spirit consciousness in individual physical forms and personalities to create and expand from those uniquely created human desires. Therefore, from this source energy\/Spirit we have the ability to easily and joyfully create the life and experiences we desire.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe it\u2019s time for us to awaken to the fullness of who we are as Spiritual beings, to evolve, and to become more and more competent with our innate abilities for creating what we really want: peace, harmony, joy, happiness, fulfillment, love, abundance, freedom, etc. I believe we are here to live a happy, harmonious and successful life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Each time we gather, we'll have a different theme to help build and reinforce positive thinking patterns, beliefs and inner narratives that will support you in living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, we'll have 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between to help you carry the positive feelings and lessons experienced into your day and life.<\/p>\n<p>This is a perfect time to let go of stress and \"busy-ness\", and to fully let go and relax into bliss. Regardless of the intentions you arrive with, they always seem to be magically satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to have a strong community; so I hope you'll participate regularly and stay in touch by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving my e-mails .

I have access to private property in Topsfield from which point I am able to stargaze through my 12\" reflector telescope. I am offering up this opportunity to the general public to join me, on occasion. Before you consider requesting the opportunity to join this meet-up, however, please be aware of the following key points. <br><\/p>\n<p>1) The program is open only to those who have not stargazed with me before. <br><\/p>\n<p> 2) These events will be offered about once or twice a month. Each star party event will consist of about ten people. As a result, I am going to purposefully limit the size of the group in order that everyone can have a fair chance of participating over the next six months. So I apologize in advance, but I simply cannot take in everyone who wishes to become involved with this group. It just is not logistically possible. <br><\/p>\n<p>3) Therefore, please only apply if you truly desire to participate, as&nbsp; I wish for the members to be fully engaged in the pursuit of stargazing to the extent that their schedules permit. <br><\/p>\n<p>4) Membership approval will require a clear photo of yourself; not a picture of you from behind, or a flower, a sunset, your foot, etc. No exceptions. I do this for security reasons, as we necessarily are meeting in the dark. It is the proper thing to do, especially for the sake of the women in the group, to know who it is that is participating. <br><\/p>\n<p>5) We will meet at dusk, while there is still sufficient ambient light, in order to be properly introduced, again especially for the benefit of the women in the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>6) There are no fees associated with the meetup events. <br><\/p>\n<p>7) You are not required to have any knowledge of astronomy, nor are you required to own a telescope. If you do own a telescope, you are certainly welcome to bring it along. <br><\/p>\n<p>8) Any disrespectful behavior on your part towards any member of the group will result in your prompt removal from the membership.<\/p>\n<p>9) Two no-shows on your part when there are people on the wait list will result in your removal from the group. <br><\/p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your interest in the North Shore Stargazers. <br><\/p>","lon":-70.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/highres_442346102.jpeg","photo_id":442346102,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/600_442346102.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/f\/6\/thumb_442346102.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193230585,"name":"Gary"},"members":41,"name":"North Shore Stargazers","id":18967224,"state":"MA","urlname":"North_Shore_Stargazer_Group","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.6399993896,"who":"Stargazers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443218500000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"single-and-dating-again","name":"Single and Dating Again","id":30376},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pheromone-Mixer\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Use your primitive brain to find a mate at our Pheromone Mixer.

Through their innovation and hard work, the organization has been able to provide its members with educational resources, a valuable Newsletter, Workshops, Adventures, Children's Parties, Special Interest and Support Groups, and much more. As TMC has grown over the years to serve more than 350 families, we continue to work hard to help all mothers in various times of need. In addition to supporting our members, we give to the local community through a variety of fund-raising efforts. <\/p>\n<p>TMC was created not only to provide resources and fun things for mothers to do with their children, but to serve as a venue for mothers to share and build their skills by volunteering to help maintain this growing organization. TMC is entirely volunteer based. It's about both giving and giving back to our community. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of being a member, and to also contribute in any way they can.

When you give this a try, you'll be able to meet quality local singles that live near you. Why waste time with dead end relationships when you will feel far better connecting with someone special you can actually see face-to-face? According to recent studies, Americans are marrying later. In fact, as of 2014, single people in the United States outnumber the married,1 meaning that if you are currently single, you\u2019re in good company! One reason for this could be that the demands of modern life don\u2019t leave much time to look for love: with the typical US work week now at 47 hours or more,2 singles who want to get a toe on the professional ladder are finding their leisure time is at a premium. Of course, just because increasing numbers who are finding themselves single, it doesn\u2019t mean that they wish to stay that way. DJ Chris Fiores Singles Dance Party is an enjoyable, relaxing and social way to meet hundreds of professional local singles. Join Us this and every Friday Night at Angelica's 49 S Main St, Middleton, MA. Never a cover charge. Plenty of free parking. Dine, Dance, Mix, Mingle and Meet Someone New And Exciting. Indeed, many are finding that the best solution to the work\/life dilemma is to seek a compromise: it\u2019s not about trying to ignore the desire for love, instead it is a matter of getting smarter about finding it.","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":78303272,"name":"DJ Chris Fiore"},"members":101,"name":"Professionals Mix, Mingle, Dine & Dance","id":19041929,"state":"MA","urlname":"Professionals-Mix-Mingle-Dine-Dance","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"VIP's"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Waltham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445275906000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beautyindustry","name":"Beauty Industry","id":2369},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"antiaging","name":"Anti-Aging","id":9862},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"salons-spas","name":"Salons & Spas","id":15409},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"beauty-professionals","name":"Beauty Professionals","id":17059},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"businesss-referral-netowrking","name":"Businesss Referral Netowrking","id":39708},{"urlkey":"nail-technicians","name":"Nail Technicians","id":59781},{"urlkey":"referral-networking","name":"Referral Networking","id":65618},{"urlkey":"nail-spa-owners","name":"Nail Spa Owners","id":116998},{"urlkey":"licensed-estheticians","name":"Licensed Estheticians","id":303981},{"urlkey":"cosmetology","name":"Cosmetology","id":1171542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Waltham-Entrepreneurs-Spa-Meetup-for-men-women\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for any man or woman to come enjoy like minded individuals who appreciate networking and referrals, enjoying a night of pampering and drinks while noshing on some delicious bites.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the greater Boston Area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50+, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online community, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Please Note:<br>-People attending these meetups may just be members on Stitch.net, and not a member of this Meetup group. -Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event posted in this Meetup group. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events. We will always post on the Meetup when this is the case. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Questions?

We are looking for folks interested in playing technical, small-sided games that we hold in Dorchester\/Boston. We play year round. During winter, we play futsal indoors. During warmer months, we play small-sided games outdoors, ranging from street\/court surfaces to small-sided turf pitches. We've started this group because we'd like to have more people join the regular games that we host, and we hope to meet some folks that will \"get\" the club and might be interested in staying involved (no pressure though). In general, our games prioritize skill, strategy, and team play over physical brutality and aggression. Indoors, we typically play 4 v 4 with small goals, no keepers, and an official futsal ball on a basketball court. Outdoors, we most often play 4 v 4 (or 5 v 5) on a small-sided turf field with a size 5 ball; sometimes we also will play a street game on a street hockey rink with a street\/futsal ball. ABOUT UPSETTERS FC: We are a diverse club based in Dorchester, focused on technical, small-sided games. We are a real club, with a family feel, an interest in design and community, and an appreciation for reggae music. We hold several regular club events (tournaments, parties, trips, etc.) and try and keep things interesting by playing friendlies with like-minded clubs. Sometimes we play in leagues, but often we find we enjoy playing and training together more than league play (and we've been successful in leagues). The focus of our sessions is overwhelmingly on \"open\" play, but we sometimes integrate games that feature a tactical\/team component. Our vibe is laid back and friendly, but we appreciate a good game, particularly one that flows well and features lots of movement of the ball and players. We have good players, and are looking for more, but more so we are looking for good people who will appreciate our weekly game and our club. We like dope uniforms and gear. Men and women are welcome; this probably isn't the best environment for real novices, but we welcome those \"returning\" to the game and those that have recently fallen in love with it. We don't tolerate ultra-competitive BS and those that mess up the vibe we've worked hard to create over the years.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194595716,"name":"hureauinho"},"members":27,"name":"Dorchester Small-Sided Soccer & Futsal","id":19061291,"state":"MA","urlname":"Dorchester-Small-Sided-Soccer-Futsal","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"players"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445841239000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"angel-investors","name":"Angel Investors","id":29000},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"artificial-intelligence-applications","name":"Artificial Intelligence Applications","id":90163},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"biotechnology","name":"Biotechnology","id":109595},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"web-application-security","name":"Web Application Security","id":161342}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonInternetStartups\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Chapter of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pro\/GlobalInternetStartups\/\">Global Internet Startups <\/a>Meetup group, Boston Internet Startups (<b>BOIS<\/b>) was founded in October 2015 and it is one of the fastest growing startup communities in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Our events empower entrepreneurs by connecting people and creating opportunities for companies to develop new businesses, meet customers, launch new products, promote their brands and expand their markets.<\/p>\n<p><b>BOIS<\/b> strives to help: Entrepreneurs, Students, Techies, Startups, Investors, Mentors and Advisors.<\/p>\n<p>This group will: Host great events, get you involved, connect people and help you take action.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Join, Participate and Enjoy! \u263a<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.iias-iisa.org\/egpa\/wp-content\/uploads\/Boston-skyline.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p>Home to some of USA's hottest startups, <b>Boston<\/b> is an emerging force in the world of innovation.

The program is led by an experienced, retired educator who has spent much of the past 20 years coaching and supporting young teachers through their first years in the classroom.","lon":-70.9400024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":21259961,"name":"RICHARD EYSTER"},"members":16,"name":"Teachers of Boston's North Shore","id":19062863,"state":"MA","urlname":"Teachers-of-Bostons-North-Shore","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.4700012207,"who":"Teachers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445886545000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"gameprog","name":"Game Programming","id":3287},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"video-game-development","name":"Video Game Development","id":55145},{"urlkey":"nodejs","name":"nodeJS","id":101960}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Electron-Atom\/","rating":0,"description":"A place where developers and entrepreneurs can share knowledge on developing apps in Electron and on using or developing for the Atom IDE.","lon":-71.0999984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":107900182,"name":"Jonathan Ross"},"members":17,"name":"Electron\/Atom","id":19063387,"state":"MA","urlname":"Electron-Atom","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3699989319,"who":"protons"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brookline","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445892639000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"personal-training","name":"Personal Training","id":18628},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Up-A-Notch\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in Fitness, Life Transformation, and Wellness.

I've had numerous opportunities to provide emotional support to others while, engaging them with my knowledge of computers and technology, providing them with a means to advance their careers while, providing me with the opportunity to be creative.

In some respects this group is experimental but in others I may find a way to structure conversations with certain rules so the experience is more practical and less free-form.

Meeting up for dinner one or two nights a week and trying different restaurants (Bukhara, Acapulcos, city feed) and others that are here. We could also maybe meet up once a week for trivia night at one of the bars or try a different bar once a week. As the group gets to know each other we could do pot luck dinners, movie nights and whatever else we fancy. We can even play tennis or shoot hoops.

Two person beach volleyball will always take priority. We plan to play every weekend day or holiday with decent weather, where the temperature approaches 60 degrees or more. At this point, we have one net to set up, so we will look for 6 to 8 people per session. Skill level will generally be B or better, which involves grasp of beach rules, relatively clean outdoor hand sets, and adequate passing and hitting skill. Hopefully we can eventually acquire additional nets to accommodate more players and a range of skill levels. We will play during winter too, on rare days when weather cooperates.
