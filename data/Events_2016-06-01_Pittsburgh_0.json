The plot follows Tom Rakewell, who squanders his large inheritance on women, drinking and gambling.<\/p> <p>Tom\u2019s journey from fortunate heir, to gambler, to inmate at Bedlam is based on <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Rake%27s_Progress\">a famous series of engravings<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Hogarth\">William Hogarth<\/a> from 1732. The opera itself is by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Igor_Stravinsky\">Igor Stravinsky<\/a>, who was inspired by Hogarth\u2019s engravings. It premiered in 1951. The libretto was written by poets <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/W._H._Auden\">W. H. Auden<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chester_Kallman\">Chester Kallman<\/a>.

Developed to support our elders who represent our roots and traditions, warriors who represent and defend our nation, \"tree\" women who represent the diversity of women who struggle through sexual, physical, mental and emotional abuse, and children in need, who represent our future and inspiration.<\/p> <p>The vision of TRFCP is supported by Herbalist's without Borders, The Union Project and Ola's Herb Shop who have collaborated with the understanding that the importance to provide this kind of space to support all members of the community is paramount. All people reflect our individual selves, therefore our societal health. In addition, access to holistic health interventions are not always accessible and available to everyone, yet are traditionally and scientifically proven to be highly effective forms of healing from which many can benefit.<\/p> <p>The clinic will be available once a month and individuals will sign-up or have scheduled visits (particularly groups coming from a facility or organization).<\/p> <p>Current days are every first Wednesday of the month, hours 1-7p.<\/p> <p>Expect to be supported by volunteer practitioner(s) of holistic health who may provide botanical therapy, meditation, Reiki, intuitive counseling, yoga, massage therapy, reflexology and much more depending on the needs of the people and the practitioners who have volunteered their services for that day.<\/p> <p>It is our hope that all forms of donations, through service, volunteer work or financial bases from interested members of the community, will sustain this vision because it is forseen to create a paradigm shift in community healthcare and delivery for the sake of us all.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/229915368\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":21600000,"name":"Three Rivers Free Clinic for the People - NOT A FORMAL MEETUP","id":"ttgmnlyvhbgb","time":1462381200000,"updated":1462404144000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"940 Penn Ave.","name":"Bakersfield","lon":-79.996582,"id":24512200,"state":"PA","lat":40.443943,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.04600381851,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445909339000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/4\/5\/600_449374117.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join Ad2 Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh AdFed for Juice, our monthly happy hour the first Wednesday of every month. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThis event is geared towards advertising, marketing and creative professionals.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

This is a great night for ringing novices to check out what change ringing is all about and the history of our 960 LB bells!<\/p> <p>Non-Ringers can also have an opportunity to try pulling the bell under the guidance of an experienced bell ringer. We are more than happy to teach you the ancient art of bell ringing.<br\/>When entering the tower, the most important rule is DO NOT touch the ropes unless specifically instructed to by an experienced bell ringer. If people are currently ringing the bells when you walk in the room, please come in quietly and have a seat around the edges of the room. We will stop ringing in a few minutes, and can give you an introduction to the bells.<\/p> <p>Learning to ring the bells does take some time before you would be able to ring comfortably on your own. Obviously the more effort you put into it the more quickly you would be able to ring confidently on your own. You can expect 4-6 weeks of individual instruction to get to that stage. And then once you learn how to handle the bells, that opens up a lifetime of ringing opportunities!<\/p> <p>Check out the videos below to see what the bell ringing is like, and you are more than welcome to come join us for our practice night! Please RSVP if you are coming, because practices sometimes get cancelled for various reasons.<\/p> <p>Bells swinging: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088<\/a><br\/>Ringers pulling ropes: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Change-Ringing-Guild\/events\/230748568\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Open House for New Ringers","id":"230748568","time":1462491000000,"updated":1462497936000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1453849598000,"name":"Pittsburgh Change Ringing Guild","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":19442348,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Change-Ringing-Guild","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Ringers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1000 Ross Park Mall Drive","name":"L.L.Bean Store at Ross Park Mall","lon":-80.008774,"id":20661892,"state":"PA","lat":40.544636,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.02280902863,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461776564000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/6\/5\/600_445658757.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.llbean.com\/llb\/ods\/33?page=outdoor-discovery-schools&amp;nav=snro1f-33\">Register Here<\/a><\/p> <p>Looking for some great local places to hike and explore?

The plot follows Tom Rakewell, who squanders his large inheritance on women, drinking and gambling.<\/p> <p>Tom\u2019s journey from fortunate heir, to gambler, to inmate at Bedlam is based on <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Rake%27s_Progress\">a famous series of engravings<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Hogarth\">William Hogarth<\/a> from 1732. The opera itself is by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Igor_Stravinsky\">Igor Stravinsky<\/a>, who was inspired by Hogarth\u2019s engravings. It premiered in 1951. The libretto was written by poets <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/W._H._Auden\">W. H. Auden<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chester_Kallman\">Chester Kallman<\/a>. Pittsburgh Opera is performing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hockneypictures.com\/\">David Hockney<\/a> production, with jaw-dropping sets, props, wigs and costumes designed by \u201cthe most influential British artist of all time\u201d.

The way we sing, the way we phrase; in fact, he created swing.<\/p> <p>During the 1920s Armstrong created the very essence of solo-oriented jazz performance through his sheer power and brilliance. And not just jazz! Classical musicians were deeply affected by his sound. We can't hear ANY piece of music anymore without hearing traces of his genius. Come and find out how this \"illegitimate\" child from the poorest and most dangerous neighborhood in the Deep South rose above poverty and prejudice to become an American Goodwill Ambassador.<\/p> <p>Tom Roberts is one of the leading exponent of early jazz piano in the world today. Having played in all the major jazz clubs in the French Quarter and on the riverboats of New Orleans, Tom has also performed twice at New York's Carnegie Hall.

Joy Guides help you begin acting like a loving adult, easygoing, generous, and more accepting of others.<\/p> <p>Then we talk about the Light Beings who are connecting with us more than ever before in order to bring greater understanding and love to us as we face the important changes now taking place.

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The PittsburghTennis staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the PittsburghTennis staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pittsburghtennisleague.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The cost will be $19.95 per tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Join Today!!<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 So <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pittsburghtennisleague.com\/join\">Join Today <\/a>and we'd be happy to get you enrolled into the next tournament.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Tennis-League\/events\/228178737\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"May Tourney","id":"228178737","time":1462921200000,"updated":1462933419000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1333480107000,"name":"PittsburghTennisLeague.com | Pittsburgh Tennis League","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":3600472,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Tennis-League","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1000 Ross Park Mall Drive","name":"L.L.Bean Store at Ross Park Mall","lon":-80.008774,"id":20661892,"state":"PA","lat":40.544636,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.02280902863,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462474576000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/6\/5\/600_445658757.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.llbean.com\/llb\/ods\/33?page=outdoor-discovery-schools\">Register Here<\/a><\/p> <p>Curious about kayaking?

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

And though she's prepared to fight her way into an elitist boys' club, or duck the occasional errant football, she quickly realizes she's in over her head when she's relegated to a kiddie-size folding chair with her new moniker\u2014Girlie\u2014inscribed in Wite-Out across the back.<\/p> <p>No matter.

We tackle hills as they come and include at least one more challenging climb (read: over 1 mile in length). The Intermediate Ride provides an opportunity to meet new riding partners, share and build knowledge, and get a workout. This is a no-drop ride. Seasoned and very fit riders can increase ride difficulty by getting out of the saddle on climbs, as well as by down-shifting and spinning at higher cadence to build muscle suppleness.

He has played with many notable acts in his 18 years as a member of the Pittsburgh music scene including Mandrake Project, The Boogie Hustlers, and Sporadic (who have recently re-kindled their eclectic musical doings after 14 years of \u201cdown time\u201d). Inspired by artists in the vein of Robert Rich, Daniel Lanois, Bonobo, and Steve Reich; he has set out to explore ambient textures and ethereal improvisations\/compositions. His creative visions have been showcased at Most Wanted Fine Arts, with the super-group Silencio at The Rex Theater, and at various yoga events throughout the city. Anthony will provide a soundtrack for the 2nd installment of \u201cLive Yoga Music\u201d that will move along with the class while cycling through various levels of intensity using lush instrumentation and driving rhythms.<br\/>You can hear samples of his works at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apstractions.com\/audio\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.apstractions.com\/audio<\/a><\/p> <p>About May's Yoga Instructor:<br\/>Tiffany began teaching in 2010, and continues in a wide range of places from various Yoga studious, to Islands, Film, and Television sets, while her favorite locations always remaining Parks and Beaches<\/p> <p>Her love for the practice gave her an undying urge to share it with others. \u201cYoga affects the mental, physical, and spiritual, body, which leads to awareness. I\u2019ve found something I believe changes lives, and I\u2019ll never stop giving it away\u201d, she says. She continually works to combine asana, meditation, and pranayama. But most importantly, Tiffany looks to help find and honor the need of the individual. She believes by bringing the body into alignment you bring your self into harmony with life around you, yourself, and others.<\/p> <p>Facebook: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/852787218201478\/?active_tab=highlights\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/852787218201478\/?active_tab=highlights<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/231016837\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Live Music Yoga","id":"231016837","time":1463247000000,"updated":1463258573000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Finleyville","address_1":"Mingo Creek Road","name":"Mingo Creek Park (parking lot next to covered bridge!)","lon":-80.017189,"id":24438805,"state":"PA","lat":40.202229,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.8750400543,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458510419000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come harvest some Stinging Nettles with us!\u00a0 And learn what all the fuss is about.\u00a0 This plant is highly nutritious and healing.\u00a0 In fact, it is one of the most nutrient-packed weeds around!\u00a0 Loaded with iron &amp; calcium, Nettle is great for our bones &amp; blood.<\/p> <p>Come on out and find out more about where to find this beauty, how to harvest her, and how to make food and medicine from her!\u00a0 I will also teach you how you can cultivate Nettles right at home.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bring your gloves!\u00a0 <\/b>I may not have many extra pairs.\u00a0 And bring a pair of scissors and a basket or bag, for collecting.<\/p> <p>If we're lucky, we will spot some baby Horsetail while we're out!\u00a0 And many other glorious wild plant allies.\u00a0 Mingo Creek is chock full of plant friends!<\/p> <p>Donations of $5 greatly appreciated, but if you don't have it, don't worry-- come on out anyway!<\/p> <p><br\/>I hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Green Nettle Blessings!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd here are directional pics, as Mingo Park can be a little confusing to navigate:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/b\/5\/600_448048085.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/c\/3\/600_448048099.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Map + Parking Lot Info in Class Description!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/swpa-wild-edibles\/events\/229743092\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Nettle Harvest & Discussion!","id":"229743092","time":1463248800000,"updated":1463444331000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1423370295000,"name":"Southwest PA Wild Edible and Medicinal Plants Group","group_lon":-80.1100006104,"id":18419106,"urlname":"swpa-wild-edibles","group_lat":40.3600006104,"who":"Plant Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Babcock Blvd at Pearce Mill Rd.","name":"North Park, Beaver Shelter","lon":-79.996948,"id":24530203,"state":"PA","lat":40.597492,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.1661567688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462476911000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/6\/5\/600_445658757.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.llbean.com\/llb\/ods\/33?page=outdoor-discovery-schools\">Register Here<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/c\/e\/600_449675022.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nJoin us for the second part of Learn Your Land, Wild Foraging Basics with Adam Haritan from LearnYourLand.com.

Deep restorative work improves range of motion and joint mobility, reduces pain and the effects of stress. We use props such as blocks, blankets and straps to support the postures, while gently stretching and strengthening the body.

exactly is a \"Moon Cycle?\"\u00a0 Though many women (and some men!) are familiar with this term, young teens and ladies in their early 20s may not yet have heard such a thing.\u00a0 Dare I say some women who have already completed menopause may not even be familiar-- our culture just does. not. teach this.<\/p> <p><br\/>A moon cycle is, at its most basic, the idea that the female menstrual cycle tends to follow certain phases of the moon.<\/p> <p>I will also discuss the basic hormone routine that each woman finds herself a part of, every week of every month, before she reaches menopause.\u00a0 The hormones are interesting, and they bounce up and down throughout each week, depending on where we're at in our cycle.\u00a0 I will describe (with as much time as we have) the basic cycle each week and what to expect.\u00a0 Did you know there are some weeks that women cannot even become pregnant?\u00a0 This is the general idea behind the more familiar \"charting\" concept.Though I will not be able to get into the details in this one hour class, I would like to introduce these ideas so that interested ladies or guys may begin to understand the bigger picture. <b>THIS IS AN AWESOME CLASS FOR TEENAGERS JUST ENTERING PUBERTY or anyone unaware of such cycles.\u00a0 Boys should honestly learn this too, as a real method for understanding the women of all ages in their lives.\u00a0 <\/b>And don't worry, I'm not too awkward about these matters!\u00a0 I teach all of my classes with an open mind and easy-going nature.\u00a0 I am just here to assist in the learning process for all of us!<\/p> <p>I also touch upon herbal solutions for irregular or imbalanced hormones.\u00a0 <b>I only wish I knew these as a teenager!!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>I'd like to stress the importance that both women <i>and<\/i> <b>men<\/b> benefit a great deal from becoming aware of the lunar cycles.\u00a0 For<b> men<\/b>, the significance of this rhythm can lie in life events and especially in connecting deeply with your partner (maybe especially if your partner is a female.)<\/p> <p><br\/>As a woman, I find that my monthly cycle mirrors the cycle of the Moon.\u00a0 And I believe this is how things always used to be, when women slept outside and found themselves closer in tune with this natural rhythm.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this course, I will cover the significance of these rhythms and how they can be very healthy for us to follow and become aware of.\u00a0 I strongly encourage men to attend these classes or workshops to learn how to better connect with and balance masculinity and femininity.<\/p> <p><br\/>The knowledge of the lunar cycle can help us to understand ourselves and the world around us much better.\u00a0 A few key points that this knowledge can assist us with are:\u00a0 <b>relationship understanding<\/b> (understanding our partner-- or family members!), <b>women's health<\/b> (hormones and how our bodies function), and how to make better sense of the world and why certain things may tend to happen at certain times and certain moons.<\/p> <p><br\/>I like to discuss some astrology in this course too, to delve a bit deeper.<\/p> <p>The moon will be waxing in Libra this particular evening, a fine time to discuss these matters

The intensity of their love reveals Beryl\u2019s truest self and her fate: to fly.<\/p> <p>Set against the majestic landscape of early-twentieth-century Africa, McLain\u2019s powerful tale reveals the extraordinary adventures of a woman before her time, the exhilaration of freedom and its cost, and the tenacity of the human spirit.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>I look forward to seeing everyone in May!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/8\/0\/600_449153120.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If the weather is warm enough, we'll be outside.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club\/events\/230543777\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"North Hills book club - Circling the Sun by Paula McClain","id":"230543777","time":1463612400000,"updated":1463747963000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1179772522000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Chick Lit Book Club","group_lon":-80.0699996948,"id":507383,"urlname":"Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club","group_lat":40.5,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"4100 Forbes Avenue (at Schenley Dr Extension) Oakland!","name":"Dippy the Dinosaur ","lon":-79.952126,"id":24547574,"state":"PA","lat":40.443531,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.83609485626,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463271389000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the Ride of Silence---honoring those killed &amp; injured while cycling. \u00a0While not a ride on the trails but on the streets...it is however, a large group ride. \u00a0Check out the local info at: \u00a0<b><a href=\"https:\/\/freeridepgh.org\/event\/ride-of-silence-2016-pittsburgh\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/freeridepgh.org\/event\/ride-of-silence-2016-pittsburgh\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/freeridepgh.org\/event\/ride-of-silence-2016-pittsburgh\/<\/a><\/a><\/b>\u00a0&amp;\/or see it on Facebook. \u00a0 The national organization's site is--<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rideofsilence.org\/main.php\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rideofsilence.org\/main.php\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rideofsilence.org\/main.php<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/p> <p>If you sign up here, we can exchange cell info prior to try to...meet-up! \u00a0Possibly afterward to grab a bite if enough time.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.

This is more about having a good time and making new friends &amp; relationships. We typically have 35-45 in attendance, so its's always a nice- sized group for meeting &amp; getting acquainted.<br\/>Total cost is $25 and includes everything: unlimited bowling from 7-10pm, bowling shoes, soft drinks, chicken salad, pizza, &amp; brownies. This also includes tax\/tip. It's a great deal and a perfect opportunity to get to talk to &amp; know lots of new &amp; interesting people. It's a very relaxed, casual, and friendly environment, which is sometimes hard to find, &amp; it makes it so much easier to mix and mingle.

Described by Leonard Bernstein as Mahler\u2019s \u201cgreatest symphony,\u201d this song cycle for two soloists and orchestra sets seven of the texts from Hans Bethge's Die chinesische Fl\u00f6te, a volume of ancient Chinese poetry rendered into German. Opening the program will be Schoenberg\u2019s own Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht in the original version for string sextet. Inspired by Richard Dehmel\u2019s poem of the same name and his strong feelings upon meeting his future wife, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht is regarded as Schoenberg's earliest important work. These performances are an exciting collaboration with Texture Contemporary Ballet, rising stars in the world of dance. Texture's founder and co-artistic director Alan Obuzor was named one of Dance Magazine's top 25 dancers to watch in 2013.

Auspicious beginnings.<br\/>Resonance Works launched in 2013 with two ambitious and contrasting projects: a fully-staged production of Verdi\u2019s MACBETH, and our first \u201csono-mosaic\u201d project entitled Natural Frequency; we worked with over 80 artists, and our projects were funded exclusively by 70 individual donors. Will you help us build upon this foundation?<\/p> <p>Why be excited about Resonance Works?<br\/>Unique. Artist-driven. Forged in Pittsburgh.

I just got certified in my Reiki Master Teacher certification and will be doing free exchange of healing's for those who ask. As I get new topic interest, we will move to those as well. The history of contact healing will also be presented. Others who join us are welcome to practice, or offer, their own healing modality as well.<\/p> <p>This group is new, and is forming as the group grows. We will cover ongoing topics of metaphysics, and really anything that could be regarded as existing outside of objective reality, and seeks to investigate the nature of reality. Big words, but true. Simply put, the groups' questioning and desires to know the things that are hard to explain will define what each new topic is each month. So, as the group grows so do the topics.<\/p> <p>This group is democratic where everyone is encouraged to join in the conversation, anyone can bring a gift to share--be it intuition, Reiki, dream work and lucid dreaming, numerology, astrology, Ascension, Enlightenment, meditation, visualization, channeling, archetypes, Angels, manifestation, Indigo Children and all of the other New Age children, Tarot, Shamanism, synchronicity, power animals and objects, multi-dimensional awareness, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th dimensions, the collective unconscious and collective conscious, spirit art, spirit guides, sacred space, empaths, medical intuition, past lives and I am sure much much more.<\/p> <p>We decide as a group what we want to study and share. This is an open group, anyone can attend. The purpose is for spiritual, emotional and soul growth. This group is also a support group of sorts, as we grow more aware it can sometimes be a little scary. So, we are there for each other--we all have our own unique experiences to share and teach. At times we can bring in teaching guests to learn from.<\/p> <p>The group is not only a forum and place where we can discuss and learn about metaphysics, but is also a place where each group member can share their experiences of this much shifting world where more and more people are feeling some sort of spiritual shift happening all around!<\/p> <p>The first meeting will be a get together to decide what we want to study, and to get to know everyone. Every group meetup will begin with a meditation after introductions. Every group meeting will have a well wishing time at the end, as everyone share a message from their intuitive mind.<\/p> <p>Most people wanted to meet on a weekend, so I chose the third Saturday of every month.<\/p> <p>I was thinking about meeting at the Panera Bread Company on Center avenue in Oakland, they have a private meeting room I can set up for our group.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Located on Center and Aiken in Shadyside.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/230975079\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Metaphysical Meetup Group","id":"fspfslyvhbcc","time":1463868000000,"updated":1463876680000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wexford","address_1":"Walter Road (near JC Stone Field)","name":"North Park Old Fire House","lon":-80.054977,"id":24529982,"state":"PA","lat":40.626633,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1697330475,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462470396000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Outkast Paddlers of Pittsburgh presents the Reel Paddling Film Festival.

Here are the details: Well, you've asked for it and here it is!<br\/>I run a holistic company based on energy practices (and a few other things), and I've run several other successful businesses as well as non-profits. Every single venture has been wildly successful. I get a lot of questions about how what and why I do things. People want to know best practices, how to do different things, and how to actually be successful. My husband was actually pushing me to do a weekend retreat to teach you everything I know, but in all reality, I think we could probably do better just by answering questions you have and sharing time. I have carved two hours out of my schedule, and I will answer any business related questions you have to the best of my ability, tell you when I don't know the answer and where to get it, and give you resources for where you can get help.<\/p> <p>I don't give legal or financial advice, and this should not be taken as such, but I am a certified career and professional coach, and this event definitely falls into that category. If it's successful or overly successful, maybe we'll do more than one. Please also keep in mind that I am in PA, and everything I know is geared towards the PA regulations and such. Because I DO NOT give legal or financial advice, you will need to check with state laws.<\/p> <p>We will start by my answering these questions, which I feel I get most often, and then it will be open questions from then on out:<\/p> <p>-What do I need to do to legally practice energy work and what are my limits (hint- being a reverend or minister does NOT legally protect you)? What's the differences between being certified and being licensed?<\/p> <p>-How do I start a business and what's the difference between an LLC, Scorp and 501(c)?<\/p> <p>-What sort of requirements are there for me to practice counseling, coaching, energy work, massague, etc? Can I teach whatever I want if I'm certified in the practice?<\/p> <p>-Why aren't all ceremonies and spiritual work legal, and what's the difference between state and federal legalities?<\/p> <p>-How do I publish a book and should I do it on my own or go with a publishing house?<\/p> <p>-How do I promote myself and advertise?<\/p> <p>-How do I survive the FDA, IRS and other regulations while still being able to talk about my business?<\/p> <p>-How do I price my services?<\/p> <p>We're also going to take a look at some of my best tips for actually running and being successful with a business. The fact is, business advice from the rest of the business world is often opposite of what you need to know to run a holistic business, so let's look at some of that, why that is, and best practices for creating a thriving practice.<\/p> <p>This will be like my other online calls. I will need you to pre-pay by sending a payment or email requesting an invoice to [masked]. I will set everything up, and we will get through as many of your questions as we can in the two hours.

Restorative yoga practice is designed to restore the nervous system and help release deeply held tensions from the body and mind. As a result of a restorative practice, the nervous system will send and receive fewer messages, triggering the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for balancing the body. Deep restorative work improves range of motion and joint mobility, reduces pain and the effects of stress. We use props such as blocks, blankets and straps to support the postures, while gently stretching and strengthening the body.

In their first meeting, however, the women realized they would have to address their differences first. Oliver, an Episcopalian who was raised Catholic, irked Warner, a Jewish woman and children's author, with her description of the Crucifixion story, which sounded too much like \"Jews killed Jesus\" for Warner's taste. Idliby's efforts to join in on the usual \"Judeo-Christian\" debate tap into a sense of alienation she already feels in the larger Muslim community, where she is unable to find a progressive mosque that reflects her non\u2013veil-wearing, spiritual Islam. The ladies come to call their group a \"faith club\" and, over time, midwife each other into stronger belief in their own respective religions. More Fight Club than book club, the coauthors pull no punches; their outstanding honesty makes for a page-turning read, rare for a religion nonfiction book. From Idliby's graphic defense of the Palestinian cause, Oliver's vacillations between faith and doubt, and Warner's struggles to acknowledge God's existence, almost every taboo topic is explored on this engaging spiritual ride.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>(Oct. 3)<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This month's theme is an incredibly important one - Vulnerability. Being vulnerable and asking for the help you need is such an important topic to discuss, especially for professional mothers who are juggling so much responsibility day to day. I'm excited to announce that the May Meetup will also include a Panel Expert on the subject - Jess Strong! Jess has a Masters in Public Policy from CMU and has years of experience working with non-profits in the fields of mental health and social work. Jess is also the visionary creator behind The Whetstone Workgroup - a new co-working space in the East End featuring drop-in daycare! (www.whetstoneworkgroup.com) Aside from her daily responsibilities, Jess is also the mother of three awesome kids!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-ROKI-Roundtable\/events\/230686527\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"May ROKI Roundtable Meetup","id":"230686527","time":1464134400000,"updated":1464146353000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1459779501000,"name":"The ROKI Roundtable","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":19798074,"urlname":"The-ROKI-Roundtable","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"ROKIMoms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1900 Murray Ave","name":"Pastoli's Pizza, Pasta & Paisans","lon":-79.922844,"id":23943094,"lat":40.435764,"repinned":false},"headcount":12,"distance":2.76845598221,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463173053000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>My Brain:<\/b><\/p> <p>5%- names, \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>3% - phone numbers, \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>2% - stuff I should know for work,<\/p> <p>90% - Songs &amp; \u00a0lyrics<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you can relate, you should join us! \u00a0Last Open Mic ended with a jam including 3 guitars, a harmonica and a tambourine! \u00a0 Free appetizer to the person who brings the most unique instrument! \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Acoustic open mic night, Sign ups start at 7:30, open mic starts 8:00pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Can't wait to see you there.<\/p> <p>You all Rock!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pickin-at-Pastolis\/events\/231105374\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":9000000,"name":"Open Mic Night","id":"231105374","time":1464134400000,"updated":1464348685000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436041023000,"name":"Pickin' at Pastoli's","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":18718827,"urlname":"Pickin-at-Pastolis","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Guitarists & those dreamin of it"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wexford","address_1":"105 VIP Drive, Route 910 (near the Wexford exit off 79)","name":"King's Family Restaurant","lon":-80.093445,"id":22265532,"state":"PA","lat":40.616207,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.6265649796,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451939467000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0No Membership Fees or Dues<\/p> <p>\u2022 Non Exclusive Networking - Everyone is welcome<\/p> <p>We currently have 3 CBP Chapters in the Pittsburgh market.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Here are the details: After several events with clients, students and in the workshop on past life work, it became fairly obvious that there are a lot of people who are suffering from soul contracts made in past lives and by ancestors that are no longer serving them and that they need a bit of help releasing. We're going to do a brief intro where I explain how this works, what you need to know, and what you need to know about this ritual. Then we will walk through the ritual which will be broadcast, though you are encouraged to perform it at home as well individually along with me. This ritual will use shamanic and witchcraft elements while having a strong basis in psychology. I will explain everything before the actual ritual so you can do what suits your beliefs and needs best, and even suggest modifications to consider before we begin.<\/p> <p>How do you know is a past life or ancestral contract is affecting you? This might be the problem if:<\/p> <p>-You are in a relationship where both of you are ready to move on but you can't seem to just finish it.<br\/>-No matter what you do, all your efforts with work and career still leave you impoverished.<br\/>-You struggle with problems around freedom, being free, or taking responsibility.<br\/>-Your ancestors were victims of genocide, rape, colonization or another like situation and you carry anger, grief or bitterness over it.<br\/>-You seem to repeat the same relationship problems in different people.<br\/>-You dream of being a slave or other bonded person and can't shake the idea that you'll never be free.<br\/>-You can't seem to have a relationship that lasts or you have ongoing sexual problems that damage relationships.<\/p> <p>The cost of the event is $10. You will need to pre-pay to get the link to the event emailed to you. The link will be emailed out about 15 minutes before the event. You will also need a mirror, white candle, and something to write on and with to participate. You can pre-pay by sending a payment via Paypal to [masked] with a note of what it's for, or you can email me at the same address and I can send you an invoice (which can be paid with paypal or a card).<\/p> <p>If you'd like, you can also purchase a ritual kit at Sparkledragon's Magical Emporium, who has generously offered to carry 25 kits for this ritual. The kits include a mirror, white candle, essential oils roll on to help the process energetically and to trigger helpful responses in the brain, and three helpful gemstones. The kits are $20 each. At this time there are only 25 kits. They will be available on April 7, 2016 until they're gone!<\/p> <p>If you'd like to take advantage of the essential oil benefits but aren't planning to buy a kit, here's the ingredients so you can make your own: Fractionated coconut oil, Royal Hawaiian Sandalwood oil (Santalum paniculatum), Boswellia carteri (Frankincense) resin oil, Boswellia sacra (Sacred frankincense) oil, Picea mariana (Spruce) leaf oil, Picea pungens\u2020 (Idaho blue spruce) branch\/leaf\/wood oil, Cedrus atlantica (Cedarwood) bark oil, Myrtus communis (Myrtle) oil, Coriandrum sativum (Coriander) seed oil, Citrus aurantium bergamia (Furanocoumarin-free Bergamot peel oil, Nardostachys jatamansi (Spikenard) oil, Vetivera zizandoides (Vetiver) root oil, Cananga odorata (Ylang ylang) flower oil, Pelargonium graveolens (Geranium) flower oil, Citrus limon (Lemon) peel oil, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) oil, Salvia sclarea (Clary) oil, Elettaria cardamomum (Cardamom) seed oil, Ocotea quixos (Ocotea) leaf oil, Bursera graveolens (Palo santo) wood oil<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/229871798\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Soul Contract Release Event (Online!)","id":"229871798","time":1464300000000,"updated":1464308628000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15143","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Sewickley","address_1":"720 Blackburn Road","name":"Heritage Valley Sewickley","lon":-80.177643,"id":1558061,"state":"PA","lat":40.543304,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":13.0140314102,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1299864223000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There is no requirement to register and no cost. <b><i>All participants must be well.<\/i><\/b> Please do bring your baby with you.<\/p> <p>Pregnant mothers, currently breastfeeding mothers, mothers who are pumping and bottlefeeding, mothers who have breastfed in the past are all welcome to participate.<\/p> <p>Meetings are led by a lactation consultant from Heritage Valley Sewickley.

Especially from my sister, who loves it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Street photography is more than a phrase; it is a way of seeing, a way of experiencing life. At its very essence street photography is capturing life without interrupting it. Witnessing and capturing a once-in-a-lifetime moment as it unfolds in front of you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'm posting a link below that is really worth the read. It's by Eric Kim and it's called, WHAT IS STREET PHOTOGRAPHY?<\/p> <p>This is going to be a really fun meet up. We will all meet (Strip location to be announced) and decide where and when we'll meet when finished. Everyone will go off to explore the streets of the Strip District. Later we'll have lunch and talk about our subjects. Of course, lunch is optional. You can even pick up some items for your Memorial Day picnic.\u00a0<\/p> <p>THE PITTSBURGH STRIP DISTRICT \/ what better place to explore?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Combine the hustle and bustle, the nightlife, some of the finest cuisine, the fun of a street carnival, and the atmosphere of days gone by. Add to this a thriving commercial center, and what do you get? Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District\u2013a place like no other.<\/p> <p>Since its founding, Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District has been a distinctive and vital part of the community and continues to be so today. Just a mile east of downtown, The Strip District has had more identities than an undercover agent, from incubator of early industry and industrial hub to a center for wholesale produce, delightful specialty shops, and incredible restaurants.<\/p> <p>The Strip District runs from 11th Street, across from the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, to 33rd Street. This one-mile stretch of land connects downtown Pittsburgh to the city\u2019s Lawrenceville neighborhood, and three major thoroughfares traverse the one-half-mile-square area of land: Smallman Street, Penn Avenue, and Liberty Avenue.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/erickimphotography.com\/blog\/2013\/08\/07\/what-is-street-photography-2\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/erickimphotography.com\/blog\/2013\/08\/07\/what-is-street-photography-2\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghphotomeetup\/events\/229940534\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"name":"STREET PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE STRIP DISTRICT","id":"229940534","time":1464442200000,"updated":1464490347000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1252253514000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Photo Safari Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9800033569,"id":1519036,"urlname":"pittsburghphotomeetup","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"6015 Penn Ave","name":"Zeke's Coffee (new location)","lon":-79.923988,"id":23585477,"state":"PA","lat":40.461502,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.49071443081,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459287229000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Pittsburgh One Step Process (<a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburghpa.gov\/dcp\/ada\/one-step\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/pittsburghpa.gov\/dcp\/ada\/one-step<\/a>) was created to make it easier for commercial properties to modify their single-step entrances to allow people of all abilities to do business.<\/p> <p>There are many, many businesses in this city that still have a one-step entryway, and one reason is because they are unaware of the One Step Process.

Restorative yoga practice is designed to restore the nervous system and help release deeply held tensions from the body and mind.

Deep restorative work improves range of motion and joint mobility, reduces pain and the effects of stress.
