The original James M. Cain novel concerns a wife and mother who works her way to financial security to provide a rosy future for her beloved daughter, but encounters difficulties and tragedies along the way. Ranald McDougall's screenplay tones down the sexual content, enhancing its film noir value by adding a sordid murder. The film opens with oily lounge lizard Monte Beragon (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/zachary-scott-p64151\">Zachary Scott<\/a>) being pumped full of bullets. Croaking out the name \"Mildred\", he collapses and dies. Both the police and the audience are led to believe that the murderer is chain-restaurant entrepreneur Mildred Pierce (Crawford), who takes the time to relate some of her sordid history. As the flashback begins, we see Mildred unhappily married to philandering Bert Pierce (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/bruce-bennett-p5377\">Bruce Bennett<\/a>). She divorces him, keeping custody of her two beloved daughters, Veda (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/ann-blyth-p6922\">Ann Blyth<\/a>) and Kay (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jo-anne-marlowe-p45650\">Jo Anne Marlowe<\/a>). To keep oldest daughter Veda in comparative luxury, Mildred ends up taking a waitressing position at a local restaurant. With the help of slimy real estate agent Wally Fay (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jack-carson-p11363\">Jack Carson<\/a>), she eventually buys her own establishment, which grows into a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California. Meanwhile, Mildred smothers Veda in affection and creature comforts. She goes so far as to enter into a loveless marriage with the wealthy Monty Beragon in order to improve her social standing; Beragon repays the favor by living the life of a layabout playboy, much to Mildred's dismay -- and possible financial ruin.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KoOr_OoHbv4\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KoOr_OoHbv4<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/231278492\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Mildred Pierce 35mm film print movie starts at 4:30pm","id":"231278492","time":1464638400000,"updated":1464680069000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Paramus","address_1":"165 E State Rt 4","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-74.05735,"id":21663102,"lat":40.916893,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.0813217163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1464269608000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's pick some longer-to-play games for this extended day!<\/p> <p>Comment with what you'd like to bring and\/or play.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the back near the private room.

Life can be more joyful when old pain is released through energetic movement. We bring consciousness to old patterns to free ourselves and make lasting changes. Focusing on a holistic process involving body, emotion, mind and spirit, Core Energetics is a mode of healing that combines bodywork, psychotherapy and spiritual process. Core Energetics is applicable to many problems people face such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, addiction, childhood and adult trauma, general dissatisfaction or a search for more meaning in their life. This method also works with stress management and chronic physical problems, including sexual dysfunction. A typical session consists of a combination of traditional talk therapy to bring consciousness and awareness to issues as well as various body movements to activate held energy in the body. Dr. John Pierrakos founded Core Energetics in 1978 and most forms of body psychotherapy and transpersonal work in the United States are informed by his work.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/alternative-health-nyc\/events\/231208995\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Introduction to Core Energetics (Body-Oriented Psychotherapy)","id":"rksltlyvhbnc","time":1464645600000,"updated":1464657404000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1037897446000,"name":"Alternative Health NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6388,"urlname":"alternative-health-nyc","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Explorers of Health"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"80 West 3rd Street","address_2":"Between Sullivan and Thompson Sts.","lon":-73.998896,"phone":"212-677-2290","name":"Amity Hall","id":1199245,"state":"NY","lat":40.729729,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.4791277647,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443104386000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nyeek.com\">www.nyeek.com<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Nyeek\/407417402635196\">Facebook Page<\/a> <b>:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NyeekGames\">Twitter<\/a><\/p> <p>Nyeek Drinks are our game nights at Amity Hall.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

It's getting really beautiful out and they have an area in the back where we can be outside but inside at the same time. So we can sit there and enjoy our tea while we have a chat!

Please come join me and let's meet up! Namaste\ud83d\udd49\ud83d\udc96<\/p> <p><br\/>It's going to most likely be a beautiful day so we may just meet at the cafe and then walk to the park together. Bring mats or towels to sit on. Sorry everyone for the inconvenience! I changed the meet up from Monday to Tuesday due to memorial weekend.<\/p> <p>It's 5 dollars per person. No one will be turned away but anything is appreciated. Please and thank you!!

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

The mouse, touch screen and other input devices have transformed how to communicate with computers, but screens of all sizes \u2013 from 1\u201d to 80\u201d \u2013 have all always been the de facto method to perceive the primary output from our microcomputers and devices. Until now. The Oculus Rift aims to be the first mainstream consumer device for Virtual Reality (VR), while Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens merges the real world with the virtual via holograms to create advanced mixed reality (MR) scenarios (also known as augmented reality, or AR).<\/p> <p>This session is your introduction to building AR &amp; MR applications and games using C#, Visual Studio and Unity. We\u2019ll review many of the hardware options, their respective SDKs and how to design real-world scenarios for both the consumer space and the enterprise. We\u2019ll also look at 3D development environments like Unity to bring to life complex scenarios. Mixed and Virtual Reality projects are no longer a dream. The technology is here. The hardware is here. The tools and SDKs are here. Come learn how to get started and build experiences beyond anything you ever imagined.<\/p> <p><b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (@ActiveNick) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.

The all-female group of Sherlock Holmes fans is dedicated to approaching the fandom from a female point of view, as well as engaging in fun, lively conversations about the canon, film and television adaptations of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s work, and associated topics. After the talk\/group discussion we'll shift our efforts to the design of the upcoming Sherlock Holmes &amp; the Internet of Thingsevent during the New York Film Festival later this fall. This session will focus on ways to connect the various crime scenes that will be staged in over 20 cities around the world. We'll be designing, prototyping and testing our collective ideas with a variety of IoT solutions. In addition curators from the Film Society of Lincoln Center will be joining to give us an overview of the upcoming festival.

At the moment, Dr. Rosenfeld is exploring rates of\u00a0geriatric falls for \u201cFloor Cultures,\u201d (i.e., cultures where it is the norm to sit and sleep closer to<br\/>the floor), as compared that of \u201cChair &amp;amp; Bed Cultures\u201d among elderly patients who seek\u00a0medical attention because they sustained a serious fall at home.<br\/>The research on ethnically-themed differences in geriatric falls is informed by Jeff\u2019s abiding\u00a0interest in cross-cultural comparisons. Along with Wid Chapman, AIA, he is author of Home\u00a0Design in an Aging World (Bloomsbury Press, 2009), which explores differences in senior\u00a0housing design for 6 of the world\u2019s most rapidly aging nations; and UnAssisted Living(Monacelli Press, 2012), also written with Wid Chapman, AIA.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>MILDRED WARNER<\/b> is a Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell\u00a0University where her work focuses primarily on local government service delivery, economic\u00a0and community development.

Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/231055501\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvhbpc","time":1464732000000,"updated":1464743850000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"90 Church St., Board Room, 4th Floor","name":"Public Service Commission ","lon":-74.005943,"id":24573842,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462929678000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Attend one of 2 Public Hearings at the Public Service Commission office in Lower Manhattan on May 31 about\u00a0the\u00a0Clean Energy Standard. \u00a0Bring friends.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Help express how much we want NYS to hurry and move to renewable energy such as offshore wind and solar and to energy efficiency and how much we don't want to subsidize nuclear power and the huge costs of dealing with radioactive, carcinogenic nuclear waste.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in mind that the proposal lists nuclear power as one of the energy sources that our Governor has included in the proposal.\u00a0Nuclear is dirty, dangerous and not renewable so help us remove it from the proposal.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For more info about the Clean Energy Standard, go to both: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allianceforgreeneconomy.org\/\">www.allianceforagreeneconomy.org<\/a><\/p> <p>and\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.allianceforgreeneconomy.org\/ces\">www.allianceforagreeneconomy.org\/ces<\/a><\/p> <p>\"In a nutshell, the proposed policy will set annual goals for the amount of renewable energy to be purchased in New York, claiming to ensure a steadily increasing market for renewable energy.

What unfolded over the ensuing years, as Robert briefly studied piano with Clara\u2019s father and even boarded with the Wiecks, was a bond that blossomed into a romance. They would have to fight for their right to get married. Which they did, some twelve years later. The diary that began the first day of their marriage (September 13, 1840) was a weekly exchanged collection of their thoughts and business of the past week. The teasing tone of Robert\u2019s statute to keep this co-journal, and Clara\u2019s sincere and heartfelt consent, are a peek into their relationship and a foretaste of the diary that follows:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\"If you agree with all this, wife of my heart, then sign your name underneath mine....I am truly your sincerely loving husband Robert, and you?\" Clara responds with her signature underneath: \"I too, your wife, Clara, who is devoted to you with her entire soul.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nIt is little wonder that their union should have been sweetened by initial struggle; but it was fortified by an intense love for one another, and for music.<\/p> <p>\n\nThis program presents songs from Robert Schumann\u2019s\u00a0<i>Myrthen<\/i>, Op. 25, as well as their one cooperative compositional effort, Robert\u2019s Op. 37 and Clara\u2019s Op. 12. In\u00a0<i>Myrthen<\/i>, as in the diary, we find inside-jokes and gems, many composed while his future with Clara was yet uncertain. Robert had this \u201cbouquet of songs\u201d beautifully bound and given to Clara as a wedding present. The act of gifting one another music became a tradition in the Schumann household and prompted Robert\u2019s desire that they should do something together. The result is the intertwining Op. 37\/Op. 12, all of which use the poems from Friedrich R\u00fcckert\u2019s<\/p> <p><i>Liebesfr\u00fchling<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0(Love\u2019s Springtime) \u2013 poems he wrote while courting his own wife.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe diary provides an intimate portrait into the lives of these artists: \"our wishes, our hopes shall be recorded therein...it should also be a little book of requests that we direct toward one another whenever words are insufficient\". These songs reach this same mark, where words are insufficient.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>New York Poetry and Song\u00a0<\/b>is a concert series with the chief aim of creating coherent programs that engage the listener, irrespective of their previous exposure to classical music. Using songs, chamber music, and\/or solo piano music, programs are bundled together by a cohesive thread to help the audience connect to the music. Linking ideas are discussed between pieces to allow listeners a big-picture scheme to hold on to. The entirety is presented in a digestible hour-long, intermission-free venture.<\/p> <p>\n\nArtists: Sung Chung, Jazimina MacNeil, Suna Chung<\/p> <p>\n\n\nEvents at Deutsches Haus are free and open to the public.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

It is, however, more advanced than the first step, which is really only the beginning of the thought reversal. The second step is a positive affirmation of what you want. This, then, is a step in the direction out of conflict, since it means that alternatives have been considered, and one has been chosen as more desirable. Nevertheless, the term \"more desirable\" still implies that the desirable has degrees. Therefore, although this step is essential for the ultimate decision, it is clearly not the final one. Lack of order of difficulty in miracles has not yet been accepted, because nothing is difficult that is\u00a0wholly\u00a0desired. To desire wholly is to create, and creating cannot be difficult if God Himself created you as a creator.<\/i><\/p> <p>We hope you'll join us this Tuesday to read and discuss this powerful and expansive idea.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Some of us \"trash talk\" when we play, but it's all in good fun &amp; in the spirit of gaming.<\/p> <p>- This is a restaurant\/bar so accidents are bound to happen. However, if you're responsible for ruining someone else's game by spilling a beverage or food on it, the right thing to do is to offer to purchase a new copy for them. Some of the games we bring are out of print so please treat every board game with respect.<\/p> <p>- If a game is accidentally ruined by a staff member, everyone at the table should pitch in to buy a new one for the owner. More often than not, this comes to about $10\/person or less, so in our opinion it isn't too much to ask for.<\/p> <p>Thanks everyone &amp; see you on Tuesday night!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/431969846974239\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers\/events\/230717461\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Weekly Game Night at TGIF","id":"xpqtmlyvhbpc","time":1464735600000,"updated":1464751472000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355802481000,"name":"Forest Hills Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":6280132,"urlname":"Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Board Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"238 E 9th St","name":"Cloister Cafe","lon":-73.987869,"id":23949949,"lat":40.729343,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.43459796906,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463885445000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DoppelkopfNYC\/events\/231305717\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"New Date!","id":"231305717","time":1464735600000,"updated":1464747455000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1251049657000,"name":"Doppelkopf NYC","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1511327,"urlname":"DoppelkopfNYC","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"Grand Army Plaza","lon":-73.970509,"phone":"917-842-3573","name":"Prospect Park","id":693957,"state":"NY","lat":40.673468,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.39644241333,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1390919228000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be doing a Prospect Park training run meeting at the Grand Army Plaza Entrance to the Park (right outside the Park) at 7:00 PM.
