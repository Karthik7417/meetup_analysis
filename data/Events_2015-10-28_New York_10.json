We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Roaming the endless carriage roads of the state park or wandering among the monuments of the cemetery it\u2019s easy to conjure an image of Ichabod Crane making his way to his schoolhouse.

A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquility.<\/p> <p>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.

This is the first time I\u2019ll be leading an event to the High Bridge. Closed for some 40 years, this walkway very recently opened up. It spans the Harlem River and connects Manhattan to the Bronx and was once used to bring water from the Croton Aqueduct to New York City. (The Manhattan Boro President said \u201cThis is almost the eighth wonder of the world\u201d and that is one great exaggeration but it is pretty cool to walk over it.)There are some really nice views from the Bridge-and no cars.\u00a0Before we visit the High Bridge we\u2019ll explore what was once the little village of Carmansville located in the West 150\u2019s and then we\u2019ll walk back and forth over the High Bridge. WE WILL THEN CLIMB UP ONE HUGE FLIGHT OF STAIRS-trust me this is the best way to do this for a number of reasons-and then we\u2019ll make our way to scenic Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan where there will be a lunch stop and a possible optional brief stop at the Cloisters. THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF SURPRISES ON THIS ONE. (I haven\u2019t done Part I yet in case you are wondering\u00a0!). I\u2019ll stop a few times to talk about what we see but this will mostly be non-stop action until we get to the Cloisters where we can relax a bit.<\/p> <p>BRING LUNCH. NO FOOD STOPS TO BUY LUNCH.<\/p> <p>We will meet BEFORE 10:45 A.M. to sign in. WE LEAVE PROMPTLY.<\/p> <p>MEETING DETAILS WILL BE SENT BY E-MAIL TO THOSE WHO RSVP THE EVENING BEFORE THE HIKE. Meeting place and ending spot will be easy to get to by subway.<\/p> <p>I bet you stopped reading by now-if not earlier!<\/p> <p>Please consider joining the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/<\/a> The Club offers many hikes, walks and events and is also active in conservation efforts and trail maintenance. Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails from Yahoo. (Contact me a day or so before the hike if you are a dues paying AMC Club member and don\u2019t get these e-mails and I\u2019ll tell you how).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members. Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup event that I have led or are an abuser of the RSVP process\u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up. PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED OTHER AMC MEETUP EVENTS.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 7:30 A.M. If there is no notice, we go. We will finish at the A subway station at 190 th Street.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/225431405\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"High Bridge to Fort Tryon Park Expedition (Part II)","id":"225431405","time":1445697900000,"updated":1445824409000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351543614000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club New York-North Jersey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":5616472,"urlname":"Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"AMC Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"FDR and Houston","name":"East River Park","lon":-73.975079,"id":840735,"state":"NY","lat":40.718984,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":2.28551959991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413631024000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Lets get going...

It's\u00a0finding a balanced, impartial state between familiar\u00a0opposites - gain\/loss, praise\/blame, fame\/disrepute, and pleasure\/pain. \u00a0What can we see and know from a neutral\u00a0state right in the middle of it all\u00a0where we\u00a0don't demand an outcome\u00a0either way? \u00a0What can we see and know when we have intention, curiosity, kindness, compassion\u00a0and courage to show up and be present for anything?<\/p> <p>One mistake we sometimes make\u00a0is equating\u00a0EQUANIMITY\u00a0with indifference. Instead of being fully present and balanced with the way things are, we detach\u00a0from actual experience\u00a0and favor apathy\u00a0or we adopt a \"pretend not to care\" mask. \u00a0Indifference is\u00a0considered\u00a0the \"near enemy\" of equanimity - it poses as balance but it's really ignoring what has actually\u00a0appeared.\u00a0We also can be challenged by\u00a0the \"far enemy\" of Equanimity that shows up as\u00a0restlessness or agitation because\u00a0we're either clinging to how we want things to be\u00a0or pushing\u00a0things away that we don't want.<\/p> <p>There are Seven Factors of Awakening in Buddhism.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 Mindfulness\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Investigation\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Energy\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Joy<\/p> <p>\u2022Tranquility\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Concentration\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Equanimity<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

Next, men go one direction, and woman another, and you enter the locker rooms. First thing you do is take off your shoes (it's only polite!) and put them in a little cubbie that opens when you wave your magic wristband in front of it. Then there's another, larger locker for your clothing. Then you change into the provided tee shirt &amp; shorts uniform and meet up with your friends of the opposite sex upstairs. If you're staying in the women's or men's locker room section, (my favorite), they've got everything you could ever need to spend hours relaxing.<\/p> <p><br\/>They've got pools with the massage jets, they have sleeping rooms, relax rooms, things to read, stuff to watch on TV, and numerous helpful attendants to answer questions, and be friendly. The hot tubs and pools in the mens and women's locker rooms are wonderful, but you are not allowed to wear bathing suits there.. If you're uncomfortable being nude, you'll forget all about that in about 5 minutes or you can just go upstairs and use the pools on the other floors. You can even get an exfoliating body scrub or massage if you want to spend a little more money. And they charge it all to that wristband thingy you're wearing.<\/p> <p><b>Upstairs is uniform only (unless you're in a pool, in which case you'll need a bathing suit). You may want to bring a larger towel for when you get out of the outdoor pools on the roof - as it can be chilly (actually you're usually quite warm in the water, and steaming when you get out.. but a beach towel is nice...)<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet up at some point for a late lunch, (they have sushi, a juice bar, and American snack food) then check out all of the amazing saunas, purchase a massage, and do numerous other pampering activities.<\/p> <p>Upstairs further are the unisex, bathing suit required pools. They have a massaging jet to hit every acupuncture point you can imagine. You can just relax in the warm\/hot water, move from station to station, and basically forget about the crazy holiday times we just lived through.<\/p> <p>We've been there several times now, and its just amazingly wonderful. It doesn't matter how you look, how big or small you are, or anything else.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

This is a great novel for those of you who have expressed interested in meta-fiction. Also, after several books in the 500-page range, this book is a very manageable 240.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Lydia Davis is considered one of the most original minds in American fiction today. Her numerous accolades include a MacAuthor Fellowship (the \"genius\" grant), a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Man Booker International Award, and the Whiting Writer's Award. She has been a finalist for the PEN\/Hemingway Award and National Book Award. Davis is also a French scholar and has translated works by Flaubert and Proust, whose works have influenced her own.<\/p> <p>True to its title, <i>The End of the Story<\/i> begins at the end of the love affair at its heart. Flashing forward a year, the nameless narrator, a writer and university teachers, goes on to tell us of her failed attempts to find \"him\" (also nameless) in a strange city. The hope is all the more urgent in that she is writing a novel about the very novel we are reading.<\/p> <p>Like many contemporary novels, <i>The End of the Story<\/i> is in large part about itself, about the painful process of its own making. It is about the strange paradox under which all writers labor, namely that the very attempt to clarify our experience can end up obscuring it.\u00a0The simplicity and precision of Davis' prose (often described as poetic) only intensifies this sense of the profound elusiveness of life and love.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/224834853\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Lydia Davis' The End of the Story--MacAuthor Fellowship, Man Booker Award","id":"224834853","time":1445706000000,"updated":1445714726000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"384 3rd Ave","name":"Whitman and Bloom","lon":-73.981117,"id":19856692,"lat":40.741608,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.744767010212,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444611690000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Hello Fall!!!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Hope all are ready to enjoy the crisp air, pretty leaves, pumpkins and s'mores.<\/b><\/p> <p>Lets get together, enjoy some good food with brunch drinks and make some new desi friends.<\/p> <p>How about brunch at '<b>Whitman and Bloom<\/b>'.

Find Metro North details here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mta.info\/schedules\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mta.info\/schedules<\/a>. You will need to get off at the \"Croton Fall\" Metro North station and take a taxi to the Orchard (it's about 3-5 miles away). Taxi number:[masked]-7038. If you are driving we will meet you there at 1pm. Bring your lunch &amp; some carving utensils for your pumpkin. You can also grab a bite at one of the local vendors on site. The orchard also offers a bounce castle, live music, food trucks and a farmer's market of fresh yummy goods. Cash is recommended. We hope to see you this weekend for some Fall Fun! Afros of all ages and ability are invited.

Be sure to dress creatively! There is a costume contest at the end. We\u2019ll be offered drink specials by each of our pub hosts, and have a fun afternoon adventure here in Queens.<\/p> <p>And, as is our tradition, we will not only enjoy ourselves, but also work to raise money for a local non-profit. This year, we're going to raise funds in support of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scsny.org\/\"><b>Sunnyside Community Services<\/b><\/a>, a great neighborhood organization that provides a broad range of services to approximately 14,000 people per year including children, youth, adults, and seniors.<\/p> <p><b>About the Pub Run<\/b><br\/>We began our Halloween tradition five years ago, which was unfortunately timed to coincide with a freak, slushy October blizzard (two of the participants actually enjoyed the adventure so much that they are now married). Last year, 55+ runners participated with some awesome costumes, and we raised a couple thousand dollars for a local non-profit while enjoying beverages and great company. This year, we will do the same!<\/p> <p><b>Please RSVP now<\/b>, prepare your costume and plan to join us. The more the merrier, so bring anybody else you can fool into thinking this is something that sane people do. Please do RSVP\u00a0so we can get an idea of how many people to expect (it\u2019s easier to encourage bar owners to give us good stuff if we have lots of people signed up).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Are you afraid that you might not be able to run 3ish miles in a Halloween costume while drinking? You should be, but not really. We\u2019ll be stopping a bunch of times (at each pub), making the actual running distances quite short. We\u2019re also extremely casual and will not leave anybody behind. The run between pubs will be comfortable-pace and friendly, suitable for just about everybody from beginning runners to marathoners and everything in-between. If you have friends or relatives who wish to join us and they insist upon only walking, please contact your organizer who can provide them with an appropriate route.<\/p> <p>Additionally, we won't force you to drink at every pub if you don\u2019t wish - we\u2019re all about safety and enjoyment! There will be plenty of water and food opportunities available to balance things out.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>You won\u2019t know which pubs we\u2019ll hit until we arrive at each. This makes things more fun, keeps the group together and lets everybody focus on socializing and enjoying the adventure.<\/p> <p><i><b>NOTE TO THE MARATHONERS: If you are planning to run the NYC Marathon a week after this event and are not drinking, but would love to participate, your organizer needs your help.

Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

On the lunch menu choose from the caesar salad, which delivers hand-made capers and a nutty flavor or the \"Black-eyed Pea Cake\".a favorite which is a breaded and fried potato-and-black-eyed-pea medallion covered in a spicy chipotle sauce.<\/p> <p>View the menu at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blossomnyc.com\/blossom-restaurant-2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blossomnyc.com\/blossom-restaurant-2\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.blossomnyc.com\/blossom-restaurant-2<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Veggie-Boomers-Brunch-Lunch\/events\/225173512\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Lunch\/brunch at Blossom 10\/24, CANCELLED","id":"225173512","time":1445707800000,"updated":1445720308000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1393829600000,"name":"Veggie Boomers Brunch\/Lunch","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":13138082,"urlname":"Veggie-Boomers-Brunch-Lunch","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Veggies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Long Island City","address_1":"4817 Vernon Blvd","name":"Dominie's Hoek","lon":-73.953804,"id":19716322,"lat":40.743618,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.94915962219,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445071468000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dominies Hoek has a deal on Mimosas with brunch.

These instructions offer essential practices for cultivating the awakening mind of compassion, wisdom, and love. This eight-verse lojong enshrines the very heart of Dharma, revealing the true essence of the Mahayana path to liberation. Even a single line of this practice can be seen as encapsulating the entire teaching of the Buddha. For even a single statement of this mind training practice has the incredible power to help us subdue our self-oriented behavior and mental afflictions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The fundamental theme of mind training practice is the profound reorientation of our basic attitude, both toward our own self and toward our fellow human beings, as well as toward the events around us. The goal of mind training practice is the radical transformation of our thoughts, attitudes, and habits. Presently, we tend to cherish the welfare of our own self at the expense of all others. However, the mind training teaching challenges us to reverse this process. This involves a deep understanding of others as true friends, and the recognition that our true enemy lies inside of ourselves, not outside.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As we practice these lojong teachings in daily life, we train the mind to embrace reality in a completely wholesome, wise, and compassionate way. These excellent practices help us purify our negativity and awaken the heart by giving us a way to transform adversity, conflict, and hardship into a direct opportunity for spiritual growth. In this way, rather than perceiving difficult people or adverse circumstances in our lives as an obstacle, tragedy, or punishment, we now meet these experiences with deep compassion, wisdom, and skill\u2014using them as our actual practice on the path to enlightenment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>By way of these treasured practices we eliminate our competitive, selfish, and emotionally reactive nature, as well as our false and exaggerated concepts of self (also called self-grasping and self-cherishing). It is important to understand that the greed, jealousy, anger, pride, selfishness, and attachment, which cause us so much suffering, are actually misperceptions of reality, not inherent conditions of our mind. Therefore, these precious lojong practices can purify our misperceptions and delusions completely, revealing the natural radiance, clarity, wisdom, and compassion of our true nature.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/0\/3\/600_443088131.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nby Geshe Langri Thangpa<\/p> <p>By thinking of all sentient beings<br\/>As more precious than a wish-fulfilling jewel<br\/>For accomplishing the highest aim,<br\/>I will always hold them dear.<\/p> <p>Whenever I\u2019m in the company of others,<br\/>I will regard myself as the lowest among all,<br\/>And from the depths of my heart<br\/>Cherish others as supreme.<\/p> <p>In my every action, I will watch my mind,<br\/>And the moment destructive emotions arise,<br\/>I will confront them strongly and avert them,<br\/>Since they will hurt both me and others.<\/p> <p>Whenever I see ill-natured beings,<br\/>Or those overwhelmed by heavy misdeeds or suffering,<br\/>I will cherish them as something rare,<br\/>As though I\u2019d found a priceless treasure.<\/p> <p>Whenever someone out of envy<br\/>Does me wrong by attacking or belittling me,<br\/>I will take defeat upon myself,<br\/>And give the victory to others.<\/p> <p>Even when someone I have helped,<br\/>Or in whom I have placed great hopes<br\/>Mistreats me very unjustly,<br\/>I will view that person as a true spiritual teacher.<\/p> <p>In brief, directly or indirectly,<br\/>I will offer help and happiness to all my mothers,<br\/>And secretly take upon myself<br\/>All their hurt and suffering.<\/p> <p>I will learn to keep all these practices<br\/>Untainted by thoughts of the eight worldly concerns.<br\/>May I recognize all things as like illusions,<br\/>And, without attachment, gain freedom from bondage.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.prisonmindfulness.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/EightVerses.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.lamayeshe.com\/article\/commentary-eight-verses-thought-transformation<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are one block from the Nassau st G station.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bkawake\/events\/225959621\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":10800000,"name":"Eight Verses for Training the Mind","id":"sdjxklytnbgc","time":1445709600000,"updated":1445721859000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434415928000,"name":"Brooklyn Awakening Meditation and Dharma Center","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18675566,"urlname":"bkawake","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Knowledge Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"568 Broadway","name":"15Five @ Fueled Collective (11th Floor)","lon":-73.997627,"id":23617369,"state":"NY","lat":40.724331,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.82183849812,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440268976000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This Event:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>The aim of this weekly event is to offer a place where Python developers and learners can come and ask questions or give help.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Individuals of all programming skill levels are welcome.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is suggested that you bring your own laptop.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field!

Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/singles-1369\/events\/225682129\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"name":"Speeddating Ages 45-57 -SOLD OUT FOR WOMEN","id":"225682129","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736217000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1190820219000,"name":"Events for 20's, 30's & 40's Single Manhattan Professionals","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":709584,"urlname":"singles-1369","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Savvy Socializers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York (Manhattan)","address_1":"738 8th Avenue","address_2":"By 48th Street","lon":-73.988091,"phone":"(212) 245-3034","name":"Bar Latitude","id":961371,"state":"NY","lat":40.759565,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.669537901878,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445438805000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Even if you're like me and don't drink much, this bar has pretty good food!

Raised by a military father and feminist mother, Christine is no stranger to adversity. Her<b> autobiographical EP tells tales of her struggles to find solace as a lesbian during her 10-year stint in the US Army at the height of the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" period<\/b>, to her battle to recover and regain sanity after an attempt to take her own life, <b>to her spiritual awakening, and finally - to finding peace<\/b>.<\/p> <p>Christine was raised in the small town of Readington, NJ. Throughout her life she looked to music as her comfort and escape. Over the past decade, she has refined a style that marries both raw grit and tender warmth akin to Janis Joplin and Chrissie Hynde. She has cultivated a home for herself within the historic music scene of Asbury Park and her grass-roots following of loyal supporters have dubbed themselves the \"Tucci Train\". Christine has opened for national recording acts including Gavin DeGraw, Michele Branch, Patty Smythe and Scandal, and Mountain.<\/p> <p>Most recently, she teamed up with two time Grammy Award Winner Marc Swersky (Joe Cocker, Hilary Duff, Roger Daltrey) and Brielle Brown (Gedeon Luke, Jacquie Lee). Together they wrote the confessional Angels of War over a four-month period. Topping off the record are two songs co-written by renowned songwriter Charlie Midnight (James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Joe Cocker). The EP was recorded live at Shorefire Recording Studios in Long Branch, NJ and produced by Swersky. It features the musicianship of Steve Holley (Paul McCartney and The Wings) on drums, Vincent Mascolo (Tunnels to Holland), and top NYC session keyboardist Alan Markley.\u00a0 At the root of Angels of War is a story of survival, resilience, and love. It's an honest portrayal of a woman who served her country and is now serving her heart.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Event Organizer & Group Member Lillian Vinci (Aka The Lady Trainer) will let folks confirmed know","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GayCatholics\/events\/225511334\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"COMMUNITY:Fundraiser For Homeless LGBT Youth -http:\/\/www.newalternativesnyc.org\/","id":"225511334","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445739271000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348229327000,"name":"Gay Catholics, Christians & Friends - Social Group","group_lon":-74,"id":5035262,"urlname":"GayCatholics","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Gay Catholics & Christians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"53 Christopher St","name":"Stonewall Inn","lon":-74.002079,"id":933525,"state":"NY","lat":40.733718,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.2933037281,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442852848000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Christian Martucci LGBT singer and song writer will perform.<br\/>Drag queens , comedians , free food , 2 for 1 drinks<br\/>10 suggest donation<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Happy-Hour\/events\/225512102\/","yes_rsvp_count":43,"name":"Fundraiser for homeless Youth (NEW ALTERNATIVES )","id":"225512102","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736209000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1263851380000,"name":"Queer Happy Hour","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1584733,"urlname":"Queer-Happy-Hour","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"167 Bleecker St (between Sullivan and Thompson)","name":"The Village Lantern","lon":-74.005974,"id":11438772,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443818438000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us for an evening of entertainment good food and good times at The Village Lantern.<\/p> <p><br\/>RSVP to [masked].<\/p> <p>(We will not be able to make a reservation if you do not RSVP)<\/p> <p>PYOS: Pay Your Own Share.<\/p> <p><br\/>Feel free to check out the menu at<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.menupages.com\/restaurants\/village-lantern\/menu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.menupages.com\/restaurants\/village-lantern\/menu<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/225786168\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"SATURDAY NIGHT SOCIAL","id":"225786168","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736223000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213936546000,"name":"Free NYC!

Light of Iris is a Shamanic healing ceremony that uses meditation, journaling, dance, drawing, music, and .... more to help facilitate lasting emotional healing and a permanent expansion of consciousness. For some that means increased creativity, for others that can mean healing deeply repressed childhood wounds in a matter of hours, for some it can mean reawakening a connection to ones ancestors and their power. It is named after my late Great Grandmother Iris Palmer who came to me in a vision as pure light during a previous ceremony.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/225633255\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":7200000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Ariyadeva!","id":"cltxklytnbgc","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736172000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"53 Christopher Street at Sheridan Square","name":"The Stonewall Inn","lon":-74.002121,"id":1483612,"state":"NY","lat":40.733017,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.33678913116,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438087152000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Christine Martucci LGBT Singer Songwriter will head line. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ChristineMartucci.com\">www.ChristineMartucci.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Drag queens , comedians<\/p> <p>Free food<\/p> <p>2 for 1 Drink special<\/p> <p>Only $10 suggested Donations<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look For Lady trainer","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fundraising-for-LGBT-Homeless-Youth\/events\/224229661\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Fundraiser For LGBT Homeless Youth ( New Alternatives)","id":"224229661","time":1445724000000,"updated":1445736182000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422347736000,"name":"Fundraising for LGBT Homeless Youth","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18384119,"urlname":"Fundraising-for-LGBT-Homeless-Youth","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Super hero's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"jersey city","address_1":"54  Journal Square plaza","name":"Landmark Loew's Jersey","lon":-74.064583,"id":19381362,"state":"NJ","lat":40.732311,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":4.09972143173,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445639860000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Loew's Jersey is an amazing theater that opened it's doors in 1929.

In this season of 'kimjang,' when neighbors get together and make kimchi in bulk in late fall\/early winter, we will bring the kimjang community spirit to Manhattan and make a variety of this pungent, spicy goodness!<\/p> <p>We'll start with a short introduction of kimchi, how it has evolved over time and discuss its variety. Then we'll make 3 types of the most popular kimchi and guide you through important steps and point out certain changes to look out for along the way, which will help you not only keep making the three delicious kimchi at home, but also start making kimchi with a variety of other fruits and vegetables with your own spin on this tradition. We'll also prepare a traditional spread eaten on the day of kimjang, and cook with kimchi to further expand your appreciation of lip-smackingly delicious versatility of kimchi!<\/p> <p>On the menu:<br\/>Baechu kimchi \ubc30\ucd94\uae40\uce58 - Spicy Napa cabbage kimchi<br\/>Kakdugi \uae4d\ub450\uae30 - Spicy radish kimchi<br\/>Dongchimi \ub3d9\uce58\ubbf8 - Radish stick kimchi in chilled vegetable broth (Not spicy, vegan)<br\/>Bossam \ubcf4\uc308 - Pork belly wraps with fresh kimchi, salted shrimp, ssamjang and leafy greens<br\/>Kimchi jeon \uae40\uce58\uc804 - Savory kimchi pancakes<br\/>Rice<\/p> <p>Price: $95<br\/>Maximum 10 people<br\/>Registration is required for this event at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/time-to-kimchi-tickets-18678973312\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/time-to-kimchi-tickets-18678973312<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Hope to see many of you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCFerments\/events\/225451564\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":9000000,"name":"Make Kimchi!","id":"225451564","time":1445727600000,"updated":1445737820000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1333397956000,"name":"NYC Ferments","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3594142,"urlname":"NYCFerments","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Fermenters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"350 7th Avenue","name":"Seven Bar & Grill","lon":-73.99305,"id":11574472,"state":"NY","lat":40.748272,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.199892312288,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442425919000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Prepay required at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5913\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5913\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.weekenddating.com\/upcoming.shtml?eventid=5913<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Weekenddating.com has teamed up with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.letmypeoplego.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.letmypeoplego.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.letmypeoplego.com<\/a><\/a> to bring you this special Jewish speed dating.<\/p> <p>Prepay and proof of age required..

It sounds interesting, although it is expensive (I'm a member). I always wanted to explore Green-Wood by night. As the date gets closer, we can see if more people are interested. Although, many of Green-Wood's events sell out pretty quickly, but, if this doesn't work out, there are plenty of others.<br\/>Into the Veil: An After Dark Exploration<br\/>Saturday, October 24, 8:00 pm - 1:00 am Into The Veil<\/p> <p>Where Green-Wood\u2019s Gothic arch rises above Brooklyn there exists a portal between the land of the living and the realm of the dead. Since the 19th century, that brownstone gate has represented the connection between those two spaces. On this special autumn evening, cross that portal and join Green-Wood and Atlas Obscura for a night of exploration and discovery. Attendees will make their own ways, on their own unique adventures, weaving together stories from the 560,000 lives interred across Green-Wood\u2019s historic 478 acres. Navigating below the silhouettes of thousands of starlit trees, curiosity will lead you through winding pathways, revealing hidden spaces of music, history, and experience. Music performances, readings, stargazing, and other activities will unfold over the course of the night, and each attendee will choose where their own night will lead. Just as Green-Wood was designed as a place for Victorian New Yorkers to step between the veil of life and the afterlife, so too will modern visitors transport into a liminal space where the city\u2019s past and present meet.<\/p> <p>$60 for members of Green-Wood and BHS\/$65 for non-members.<\/p> <p>Green-Wood members can buy tickets to all public programs before the general public. Please enter the members\u2019 password below. Tickets to this event for nonmembers will go on sale shortly.

We take you deep into the underworld of one of NYC\u2019s most beloved neighborhoods: Greenwich Village. Now a hub for trendy restaurants, celebrity pads and hangouts for NYC\u2019s elite, Greenwich Village was once home to parlor houses, speakeasies and gambling halls - and all the debauchery that followed.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226161394\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytnbhc","time":1445778000000,"updated":1445789891000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10604","country":"us","city":"White Plains","address_1":"550 North Street","name":"White Plains High School","lon":-73.738106,"id":1916941,"state":"NY","lat":41.018188,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":22.7728176117,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406687537000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bring a white shirt and colored shirt to help with forming teams easily.

Frequently, however, this openness masks a reluctance to explore the very traditions out of which we ourselves have emerged. In this series Rev. Robb will take a fresh look at the spiritual insightfulness and moral imagination contained in the teaching of Jesus while emphasizing how they may continue to be revelatory in our current context. It is always surprising to look carefully at the actual words of great teachers with whom we have assumed we were fairly familiar and to discover new ways of understanding and fresh insights of which we were unaware. In this series we will examine in depth some of the stories Jesus told\u2014the parables\u2014which were probably the most characteristic and innovative way he had to convey his own spiritual vision.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>\u00a0Rev.

The rail-trail has been built in segments, and there is still work to be done to open all <b>46 miles<\/b> of the paved road trail. Virginia has volunteered to guide those doing a shorter 25 miles total also.<\/p> <p>The southern end of the trail begins at the Metro North Railroad Station in Wassaic, New York. It is possible, during non-rush hours and on weekends, to board a Metro North train in Grand Central Station and in a little more than two hours be peddling or walking along this rail-trail. As the trail points north for nearly 11 miles to Millerton, it passes through a pastoral scene. Farmland stretches before and around you, followed by red-cedar scrubland and beaver ponds. In Amenia, the trailhead parking lot is on the site of the former Barton House, a large hotel.<\/p> <p><br\/>Several railroad stations on this line have been restored: Sharon Station is now a private residence located off the trail in the town of North East. Millerton's three stations have been restored and today house local businesses. North of Coleman Station the trail crosses six reconstructed railroad bridges.<\/p> <p>The railroad builders tamed the area's rolling terrain, and created a level corridor, by blasting through rock and building the rail bed up from the land adjacent to the corridor for a \"pyramiding\" effect. In several stretches, north of Route 61, the trail's higher elevation on steep embankments , in some places dropping 50 feet\u2014provides spectacular views of the surrounding farmland. Indian Mountain, straddling the border of New York and Connecticut, is to the east. Traveling through a series of deep rock cuts, you will feel the temperature drop several degrees from the surrounding landscape.<\/p> <p>The next 8 miles of the railroad corridor between Main Street in Millerton and Under Mountain Road in Ancram are not open for public use.<\/p> <p>Reaching the next open trail section requires a detour on a two-lane road. Head west on Main Street in Millerton and then north on New York State Route 22 for about 7.7 miles. Turn right on Under Mountain Road and look for the trailhead on the left. The 4-mile paved section of trail between Under Mountain Road and Taconic State Park is more wooded where the trail hugs the base of the South Taconic Mountains.<\/p> <p>About 2.9 miles north of Under Mountain Road, the trail detours onto a scenic dirt road for 0.4 mile to bypass a privately held parcel of rail bed. The dirt road rejoins the paved rail-trail for another 0.5 mile to the entrance to Taconic State Park at Copake Falls. Scenic Bash Bish Falls is located about 1 mile east of the trailhead, just over the Massachusetts state border. Follow the hiking trail to reach the falls.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.traillink.com\/submit\/submittraildescription.aspx?AcctID=6016782\">Edit Description<\/a> Parking and Trail Access<\/p> <p>To reach the Wassaic trailhead: From I-84 or I-684, take State Route 22 north at Brewster. Continue north on Route 22 to the Wassaic Station of the Metro North Railroad. The station is on the right side of the road.<\/p> <p>To reach the Taconic State Park Trailhead: From I-84 or I-684, take State Route 22 north to Brewster. Continue north on Route 22 to State Route 344, about 6 miles north of Millerton. Turn right and proceed about 0.5 mile to the triangular green. Bear to the left to the stop sign.

Any action that remains unfulfilled as per our fantasy, either due to hindrance from the outside world or from within can be termed as an incompletion. This can be either with ourselves or with another person. If we want a friend to live up to certain expectations that he or she can not honour, then it leads to incompletion. The first step to healing such an incompletion is to render the relationship complete. The only way to do this is by facing the other person and healing the hurt caused in the relationship. This can also be done by invoking their presence if they are no longer physically present. This process of completion and subsequent healing is absolutely necessary. Unless we are complete in all dimensions, life does not begin \u2013 living does not happen in us.<\/p> <p>Similarly, incompletion also happens internally. Any unfulfilled desire or fantasy carried by us, relating to ourselves, remains as an incompletion. The ideas which we have about us, we should either fulfill them or drop them. If we can not afford to fulfill them with our adopted lifestyle then dropping those will bring about completion with ourselves. For completion to happen, authentic listening needs to happen first. We need to authentically listen to the cries of our heart. This does not mean we will do everything that our heart wants. Just listening to our heart can give tremendous self satisfaction. Completion with ourselves involves giving ourselves the much needed self-attention. It even cures physical pain, as pain is a simple manifestation of being unable to sit comfortably with oneself.<\/p> <p>When there is a disturbance, the source is invariably from within us. Be it any kind of hindrance, this technique of completion within the self will be the path to enriching one\u2019s life and cleansing the body of all negativity in its varied forms.<\/p> <p><br\/>by Nithyananda Times on May 29, 2013 in Completion, Meditation<br\/>Be Complete!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Port-Washington-Healing-Insight-Transformation-is-Meditation\/events\/226218481\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Are you incomplete with you?

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at <b>[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/226148306\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"Sexy Halloween Shoot with Lily Marie & Jenny - Oct. 25","id":"226148306","time":1445788800000,"updated":1445812087000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"315 Columbia Street\/West Carroll Gardens\/near Hamilton Ave. and BQE and Battery Tunnel merge, www.jalopy.biz for directions","name":"JALOPY","lon":-74.004387,"id":614216,"state":"NY","lat":40.681274,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.81794548035,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445183641000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Friends, sorry to miss last months' fine harmony class, but I did have a fine time in Scotland and Ireland!

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225942160\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytnbhc","time":1445788800000,"updated":1445800509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10458","country":"us","city":"Bronx","address_1":"2900 Southern Boulevard","name":"New York Botanical Garden","lon":-73.880342,"id":1558113,"state":"NY","lat":40.861704,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.63494682312,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443758555000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/frida\/fall.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/frida\/fall.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nybg.org\/frida\/fall.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Current Prices<\/p> <p>Weekends, Monday Holidays, and Select Peak Days<\/p> <p>Adults:\u00a0$25<\/p> <p>Students (with valid ID): $22<\/p> <p>Children (2\u201312):\u00a0$10Children under 2: Free<\/p> <p>Members: Free<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nD\u00cdA DE LOS MUERTOS WEEKENDS<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nOctober 24 &amp; 25 and October 31 &amp; November 1<\/p> <p><br\/>FRIDA KAHLO\u00a0concludes with a celebration of the Mexican tradition known for bringing together family and friends to remember loved ones, D\u00eda de los Muertos.

Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.<\/p> <p>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This book is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0316229296\/\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin\/1117543436\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/store.kobobooks.com\/en-us\/ebook\/the-fifth-season-11\">Kobo<\/a>, digital or otherwise.<\/p> <p>* * *<\/p> <p><br\/>IMPORTANT RSVP POLICY<\/p> <p>If you RSVP and find you cannot make it, please change your RSVP so that we are not waiting for you.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field!

At the beginning of the story, Amelia says she is considering quitting online dating. How would you compare the act of buying books online to the act of dating online? Is it relevant to the story that Amelia meets her eventual husband in a very analog location, a bookstore?\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. Consider the setting. Why do you think the author chooses to set the book on an island? How does the island setting reflect A.J.\u2019s character?<\/p> <p>\u00a03. Perhaps oddly, vampires are a recurring motif in the story: for example, when A.J.\u2019s wife throws the vampire prom and when A.J. watches True Blood to court Amelia. What do you make of the references to vampires?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. Lambiase moves from an occasional or nonreader, to a reader, to a bookseller. How do you think becoming a reader changes him? Consider the scene where he decides not to confront Ismay about the backpack. Do you think Lambiase\u2019s reaction is different than it would have been if he hadn\u2019t taken up reading?\u00a0<\/p> <p>5. The author chooses to begin each chapter with a description of a short story. Discuss some of the ways the stories relate to the chapters with which they are paired. Is A.J. creating a canon for Maya? How does the book itself function as a kind of canon? If these are A.J.\u2019s favorites, what do they say about A.J. as a reader and as a man?<\/p> <p>\u00a06. Did you find Ismay\u2019s motivations for stealing Tamerlane to be forgivable? How do you think she should pay for her crime? Why do you think Lambiase lets her off?<\/p> <p>\u00a07. At one point, Maya speculates that perhaps \u201cyour whole life is determined by what store you get left in\u201d (page 85). Is it the people or the place that makes the difference?\u00a0<\/p> <p>8. When did you become aware that Leon Friedman might be an imposter? What did you make of Leonora Ferris's reasons for hiring him?<\/p> <p>\u00a09. How do you think Daniel Parrish might have changed if he had lived? Do you think some people never change?\u00a0<\/p> <p>10. Were you surprised by the outcome of the short story contest? What do you think of A.J.\u2019s comments to Maya about why certain books and stories win prizes and others don\u2019t? Does the knowledge that a book has won a prize attract you to reading it?<\/p> <p>11. Compare Maya\u2019s \"fiction\" about the last day of her mother\u2019s life to Ismay\u2019s version. Which do you consider to be more accurate and why?<\/p> <p>12. How do you think the arrival of the e-reader is related to the denouement of the story? Is A.J. a man who cannot exist in a world with e-books? What do you think of e-books? Do you prefer reading in e- or on paper?\u00a0<\/p> <p>13. On page 159, A.J. asks Maya, \u201cIs a twist less satisfying if you know it\u2019s coming? Is a twist that you can\u2019t predict symptomatic of bad construction?\u201d What do you think of this statement in view of the plot of The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry? Did you guess who Maya's father was? If so, what were the clues?<\/p> <p>14. The author chooses to end the novel with a new sales rep coming to an Island Books that is no longer owned by A.J. What do you make of this ending?\u00a0<\/p> <p>15. What do you think the future holds for physical books and bookstores?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Usually in the room to the right of the registers.

Thank you.\" C.L.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\"Instead of the 'knowledge gained', I find it appropriate to give a 5 star to 'raising my vibrations' during the meditation.... the energy of the group was Amazing and ZINGING!
