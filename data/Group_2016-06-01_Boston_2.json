Our meetups will be in the form of Laughter Yoga and Meditation sessions followed by brief discussions about laughter and play in our lives. \u00a0Laughter Yoga and Meditation involves simple movements, breathing, and obviously laughter, and is open to all ages. \u00a0Comfortable clothing is a plus but Laughter Yoga and Meditation isn't your usually yoga class so no special attire, mats, or props required although you'd be quite surprised on how much a workout continuous laughter can be. \u00a0No previous experience in yoga, meditation, or having a sense of humor necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin and I\u00a0started this group because we like to play and laugh, and laughter yoga was one of\u00a0the best ways we have found to fulfill that basic need. There are many proven physical\u00a0and psychological health benefits to the practice, which have been backed by peer-reviewed studies, but speaking to people about laughter yoga what comes up often\u00a0is that people feel they\u2019re not having enough fun in their life. We would like to\u00a0address that.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Which brings up the question: What is laughter yoga? Despite the name, there are\u00a0<br>\n\nno physical poses. What it takes from yoga is the attitude of practice \u2013 the idea isn\u2019t\u00a0<br>\n\nto be the best at doing the exercises, but simply to start where you are and begin\u00a0<br>\n\nto develop, over time, an innate and core aspect of your humanity. While yoga\u00a0<br>\n\nconcentrates mainly on the body, this practice focuses primarily on the capacity for\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter and playfulness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Laughter is by its nature contagious, so while it may begin like \"fake\" laughter, it\u00a0<br>\n\noften turns into real authentic laughter. \u00a0Playful exercises are generally the types of games you would play with a young\u00a0child.<\/p>\n<p>Time Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker (subscription needed for\u00a0<br>\n\nfull article) have all written about laughter yoga. Though he has no affiliation with\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter yoga, Dr. Stuart Brown gave an interesting TED talk on the importance\u00a0<br>\n\nof play to the human brain.

We aren't asking for advice or a quick fix, but we are eager to be honest and create deep connection with others who aspire to stay present, share, and mindfully celebrate our vulnerabilities in ourselves, each other and the wider world.<\/p>\n<p><b>Locations in Boston, Cambridge &amp; Weymouth!<\/b> <br> <\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10759397,"name":"Christine White","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/highres_8049434.jpeg","photo_id":8049434,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/member_8049434.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/thumb_8049434.jpeg"}},"members":258,"name":"Free-Writing Women in Boston, Cambridge & Weymouth","id":14358182,"state":"MA","urlname":"Free-Writing-Women","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Free-Writing Women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1399663703000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"novel-writing","name":"Novel Writing","id":20576},{"urlkey":"critique-group","name":"Critique Group","id":34868},{"urlkey":"short-stories","name":"Short Stories","id":62138},{"urlkey":"beginners-creative-writing","name":"Beginners Creative Writing","id":149837},{"urlkey":"creative-writing-group","name":"Creative Writing Group","id":1081732}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dorchester-Writers\/","rating":4.81,"description":"<p>This is a group for writers in Dorchester and South Boston (and other neighbors, of course).

(Joomla and WordPress are also CMSs.) Drupal is used to create and manage all kinds of web content. Though Drupal is very powerful as a framework to build websites of all kinds, it is nevertheless remarkably user-friendly. Drupal empowers people from all walks of life, with little previous web design or development skills to relatively easily create dynamic websites with all sorts of bells and whistles. Of course easier doesn\u2019t mean effortless! A growing number of educational, Fortune 500, governments, and nonprofits already use it or are now migrating to Drupal. Places like the MIT Media Lab, The White House, The United Nations, Amnesty International, Best Buy, Zappos, FedEx, and The Economist use Drupal.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Best Bilingual Solutions, Inc. : Best Bilingual is a startup publishing house based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that publishes printed, digital and audio books in all the major and many of the minor languages of the world. The company has so far published four titles in up to eight different languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and French, with many more titles and languages to come in the near future, in printed, audio, and eBook formats.

Aficionado or novice, all are welcome.<\/p>","lon":-71.0599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/highres_375600032.jpeg","photo_id":375600032,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/600_375600032.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/thumb_375600032.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14635,"name":"Tom","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/7\/6\/highres_144196502.jpeg","photo_id":144196502,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/7\/6\/member_144196502.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/7\/6\/thumb_144196502.jpeg"}},"members":352,"name":"Boston Whiskey Meetup","id":15054352,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Whiskey-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"whiskey lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402709990000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/after-work-cambridge-20s-30s-happy-hour\/","rating":4.9,"description":"It's a weekday, but it can still be a fun day.

Heterosexual, bi and gay members welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Gateway Women are a band of very diverse women, but we all share the feeling of 'not fitting in' to a culture that doesn't seem to have a place for us.<\/p>\n<p>You're not weird.

New members joined after the original members completed the training program, so we've evolved into a more free-form workout-buddy thing where new runners are welcome to start the interval training, old runners are able to do 5K time improver exercises or longer runs according to their own preferences, and everything stays social by scheduling workouts by time instead of by distance so that we all warm up and cool down together. The track is open to the public and I've seen people running, walking, and interval training regardless of what time I've been there, so it's been perfect. There's parking on the street for Somerville residents and a small commuter lot that the campus police seem to ignore. However - we're in a state of transition since we're getting into winter. Because it's been too cold out for regular runs, we've switched over to doing runs every week or two for social reasons\/to get somewhere cool, like the recent runs to Bantam Cider and Downeast Cider. We've talked about Aeronaut Brewery in Cambridge and a few restaurants and festivals. Those runs are around 2 miles and that's the perfect distance to get there in about the same amount of time whether you're running intervals or just doing a straight jog, or faster if you're already really great at it. There's a virtual event posted for a fictional date in March - it's a place to suggest runs, which will then then turn into events. If you see something you'd like to try, please suggest!\u00a0 You can always +1 if you'd like to bring a friend.

Anthroposophy a.k.a. \u201cSpiritual Science\u201d encompasses many forms of spiritual striving, and our goal is to provide an open and supportive environment for discussing topics about inner spiritual development, personal growth and social transformation. As a modern way of knowing, Anthroposophy is non-denominational, and open to all who are on (or seeking) a spiritual path, and wish to share the fruits of their efforts with others. Although general in nature, it should be noted that our activities and the topics of our discussions are often based on or around the work of philosopher and spiritual scientist, Rudolf Steiner.

If you have not played many of these types of games but are curious, please join us--we enjoy teaching them as much as we do playing them! Our goal is to have fun trying new games in a relaxed and not-super-competitive setting.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-71.1100006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/3\/8\/highres_407877912.jpeg","photo_id":407877912,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/3\/8\/600_407877912.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/3\/8\/thumb_407877912.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41679762,"name":"Ryan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/7\/4\/highres_249338004.jpeg","photo_id":249338004,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/7\/4\/member_249338004.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/7\/4\/thumb_249338004.jpeg"}},"members":333,"name":"The Medford\/Melrose\/Malden Tabletop Games Meetup","id":16884022,"state":"MA","urlname":"MedfordMeeples","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Meeples"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410275332000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"gita","name":"Bhagavad Gita Study","id":1816},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"chanting","name":"Chanting","id":15858},{"urlkey":"kirtan","name":"Kirtan","id":18868},{"urlkey":"devotional-singing","name":"Devotional Singing","id":21450},{"urlkey":"mantras","name":"Mantras","id":21604},{"urlkey":"bhakti-yoga","name":"Bhakti Yoga","id":26446},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-chanting","name":"Meditation and Chanting","id":82258},{"urlkey":"kirtan-and-meditation","name":"Kirtan and Meditation","id":193321},{"urlkey":"bhakti-yoga-for-beginners","name":"bhakti yoga for beginners","id":1419042}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bhaktiyogis\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in Bhakti Yoga (The Way of Love) as means of personal and spiritual development.

I want this group to be a place of support where we can bring our questions and concerns about parenting donor-conceived children and all of the issues that can bring up--for us and for our children--so that we can make the most of this incredible journey while we raise our miraculous children! ***Please note, our initial meetings will be held in Swampscott, MA (North Shore), but I'm totally open to have it in other locations if any of you are interested in hosting some meetings***<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-70.9100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/a\/highres_408781882.jpeg","photo_id":408781882,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/a\/600_408781882.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/a\/thumb_408781882.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13986532,"name":"Rebecca","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/9\/2\/highres_224557522.jpeg","photo_id":224557522,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/9\/2\/member_224557522.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/9\/2\/thumb_224557522.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"Parents of Donor Conceived Children","id":16956892,"state":"MA","urlname":"Parents-of-Donor-Conceived-Children","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.4700012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410564504000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"indianmusic","name":"Indian Music","id":9131},{"urlkey":"hindi-singing","name":"Hindi Singing","id":41438},{"urlkey":"bollywood-karaoke","name":"Bollywood Karaoke","id":43796},{"urlkey":"hindi-karaoke","name":"Hindi Karaoke","id":129385},{"urlkey":"bollywood-singing","name":"Bollywood Singing","id":131528},{"urlkey":"bollywood-songs","name":"bollywood songs","id":146099},{"urlkey":"indian-karaoke-group","name":"Indian Karaoke Group","id":730542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bollywood-Karaoke-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Get-together and sing\/enjoy bollywood (or any indian language) songs.

We welcome people from all different religious, social, and political backgrounds; people with disabilities, whether they are blind, deaf, need to use a wheelchair etc.; and people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual\/demisexual, transgender, genderqueer, agender, bigender, intersex, other queer, questioning, and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Obviously, in a group like this, people are bound to be occasionally uncomfortable with some of the topics being discussed. &nbsp;Please remember that all topics are permitted, provided that those involved in the discussion can provide evidence-based reasoning to back up their viewpoint. If there is a topic that makes you uncomfortable, we will not stop debating it. I would instead encourage you to take a walk and unwind, branch off at another table with other people and discuss something else, or leave and come back next time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Name-calling and ad hominem attacks are unacceptable. Attack people's ideas, not the person themselves. You may say things like, \"That idea is fucked up\" or \"Oh, God, do you believe that?\"; these debates tend to get quite impassioned!

They are built to address a specific use case and be modified by your analysts as your business requirements change.

It's \"summer\" all year long now for us! We can do what we want, when we want! No more waiting for weekends and then having to try to find parking in crowded lots etc. We are free! I retired from teaching this year and am looking for others who would love to get together for some fun (outdoors preferably) whenever we feel like it! Especially during the week when others are working and places are not crowded. While we will set-up activities to look forward to, those who are up for \"last minute\" gatherings can share their preferred \"instant contact\" info and we can text, email or call one another to invite for spontaneous fun.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I love to hike (easy to moderate), bike (same), kayak, scuba when in warm waters and explore new places. I also love to travel and think it would be great to have some friends to travel with. (Right now I'm looking at ways to explore New Zealand and Australia and environs, but I am open to anything.) I'll even learn to play cards again when the nights are long and the weather not so inviting. Don't let my \"lack of focus\" scare you- it's just about being OPEN to whatever sounds like fun as the moments arise and acting on it- with friends. I'm so happy to be retired!

You and the kids are going to LOVE our weekly adventures! <br> <\/p>\n<p>Our group meets YEAR-ROUND every Tuesday at 10am at various hiking trails in the metrowest area. It's a great opportunity to meet up with friends and enjoy some relaxing outside time and learn some new trails mostly likely right in your back yard! These events are FREE and appropriate for children up to 6 years. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Previously, I was a part of a great hiking group closer to Boston that met every week. Even though I have moved to the 'burbs', I still get out there every week with my family and would love to meet other parents who know the value of getting our kiddos outdoors. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The hikes are suited for caregivers who carry their children and for young children who toddle\/run on their own. No stroller hikes unless specified in the details of the hike. Please dress appropriately for the weather and terrain with layers, appropriate footwear, hats, sunscreen and water. Be prepared for ice, mud, scorching heat and\/or brisk winds! This is New England after all; though I don't expect them all in one hike.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We stroll at a slower pace to allow the children to soak up the environment, caregivers can chat with a new friend and we'll try to keep the group relatively close together. Our trail will be short and simple so you are free to take another loop around. Also, if your little one's pace is REALLY slow (I was once in that group) you can linger on the first trail in and we'll meet up with you on the way out.<br> <\/p>\n<p>Remember, we're kid friendly. We're all parents and caregivers doing our best to enjoy the outdoors with young children. The trails are selected for ease of walking and are short enough for the young ones to endure.&nbsp; We'll take breaks and spend plenty of time playing in leaves or snow, rolling over logs to check for bugs and skipping stones..... all things our kids should be doing and this is great place for it.<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I'm happy to help! <br> <\/p>\n<p>See you out on the trail!<\/p>\n<p>Emily Z<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-71.4499969482,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":183508660,"name":"Emily Zaffino","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/highres_242841796.jpeg","photo_id":242841796,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/member_242841796.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/2\/4\/thumb_242841796.jpeg"}},"members":245,"name":"Kid Friendly MetroWest Hikes","id":18324384,"state":"MA","urlname":"Kid-Friendly-MetroWest-Hikes","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Hikers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1421037280000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diabetes","name":"Diabetes","id":1482},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetic-adults","name":"Type 1 Diabetic Adults","id":32017},{"urlkey":"support-for-people-with-diabetes","name":"Support for People with Diabetes","id":33456},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetes","name":"Type 1 diabetes","id":56368},{"urlkey":"type-i-diabetes","name":"Type I Diabetes","id":71560},{"urlkey":"diabetes-management","name":"Diabetes Management","id":144757},{"urlkey":"type-1-diabetes-support","name":"Type 1 Diabetes Support","id":922392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Go-Type-1-Diabetes\/","rating":0,"description":"We will become the largest social, support and active gathering of Type 1 Diabetics in Boston in 2015.

A Speaking Circle is designed to give people the confidence and the skills to interact with others, to speak in informal situations, and to present in front of small groups. Examples of people that are drawn to Speaking Circles include: \u2022 People that get nervous when making a presentation or speaking at a meeting. \u2022 People that find it hard to make conversation at gatherings and social events. \u2022 People who lock up or feel awkward in social situations. \u2022 Anybody who wants to improve their speaking skills in informal situations. Imagine standing in front of any audience, feeling absolutely confident and at ease. That is what Speaking Circles can do for you. Whether you have public speaking anxiety or simply want to express yourself with greater clarity the experience in a Speaking Circle\u00ae will guide you toward effortless authenticity. Speaking Circles help: Business professionals become more effective, authentic and powerful. People expand their vision of what life could be like when they are able to be fully present, confident and authentic. People who suffer from stage fright to overcome their fears. At a Speaking Circle you are provided all the support you need to express yourself in your own time and in your own unique way, without fear or discomfort. Some call this depth of expression, \u201cspeaking from the heart,\u201d \u201cthe authentic self\u201d or \u201cyour real voice.\u201d Whatever you call it, you know when you are there; you know when someone else is there.

Maybe you're in your twenties or thirties and you find yourself becoming increasingly more spiritually expansive with time, but yet simultaneously feel less and less completely able &nbsp;\"fit in\" with the masses of mainstream thinking. Maybe you feel like you need a \"tribe\". &nbsp;My hope is that this group will create a space where the younger generation of spiritual, open-hearted, open-minded, like-minded free-spirits can come together to connect with each other, share ideas, merge the philosophies of East &amp; West, and grow. Let's start first by finding each other. Are you a lover of yoga, meditation, philosophy, zen, buddhism, hinduism, spirituality, hippies, free-spirits, crystals or transformational festivals? This may be a great place to make some new friends and have some fun!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>My personal background is I was born to a couple teenage hippies and grew up in a Hindu based cult in Montana. I've been exposed to the ideas of the east, meditation, yoga and philosophy starting at a very young age.

Meetups can include brainstorming sessions, ideas for work life balance, creative time management strategies (especially managing our KIDS!), raising capital, marketing plans, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My name is Felicia, I am founder of the Mompreneur Soul and have built this FREE community to give Mompreneurs everywhere the space to bridge motherhood and entrepreneurship, a thing that is not easy to find! You can find out more about my business here at&nbsp;<a>www.mompreneursoul.com.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>A Little About My Background<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of my career I have noticed how most of my female peers, particularly mothers, were missing from top leadership positions across the corporate environment but were showing up in huge numbers as owners of small home based businesses. I began to question my own career and life decisions when I started a family and began to realize that there is far more to living a \"successful\" life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office, and that as a mother, that all came at a hefty price. In the midst of the American epidemic of career burnout, stress-related illnesses and erosion of family life, I started to question how mothers could be better supported in their struggle to allow both their business leadership and motherhood roles to coexist and simultaneously thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The result was years of doctoral research aimed at understanding the Mompreneur phenomenon, a recent societal trend where mothers are choosing to leave behind either a full time corporate career or a full time stay at home mom career for small business ownership. It became clear to me after years of interviews with mother-entrepreneurs across the country that these women were discovering a \u201cloophole\u201d to the mainstream career issues that plagued mothers for decades. Whether they had left behind a career as a corporate executive or they had been a stay at home mom for years and wanted to re-start a career, I noticed the common thread for these Mompreneur women was that they got what their soul was craving: the ability to simultaneously be a mom and have a career on their own terms, without sacrificing one for the other. These women confessed it wasn't an easy road to take, but at the end of the day they called the shots, they had more freedom to decide when they worked on the business or spending time with their children and they chose businesses that put their life passion and purpose at the center.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;My question then was how could I help power moms everywhere stuck in the fear and dysfunction of the mainstream career matrix successfully transition into entrepreneurship, and how could I help corporations who were losing these valuable savvy women leaders foster a healthier culture and environment to better retain and empower them. The answer to this question was the birth of Mompreneur Soul, a consulting firm aimed at nurturing a women\u2019s journey through motherhood and business leadership and entrepreneurship. My background includes being a mother, corporate executive, entrepreneur, business professor, certified career coach, and Kundalini yoga and meditation teacher, and my life work and passion is to revolutionize how our culture, our workplace and business leaders everywhere re-think motherhood and leadership, and how mothers can infuse soul into their families, careers and businesses.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/highres_433857755.jpeg","photo_id":433857755,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/600_433857755.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/thumb_433857755.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11310777,"name":"Felicia Newhouse","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/highres_200641352.jpeg","photo_id":200641352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/member_200641352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/thumb_200641352.jpeg"}},"members":132,"name":"Mompreneur Soul Productive Playdates","id":18399943,"state":"MA","urlname":"MompreneurSoul","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Mompreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Peabody","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422763042000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"socializing-for-40","name":"Socializing for 40+","id":16181},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"singles-friends-social-network-enjoying-life","name":"Singles, Friends, Social Network, Enjoying Life","id":23626}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Fun-Friends-for-Women\/","rating":4.85,"description":"<p>This group is for fun, happy, women (40+) who would love to get out&nbsp;and expand their circle of friends.

There is nothing wrong with such groups and companies, but there is no need for another group to do the same &nbsp;as they do. &nbsp;The goal for this group to fill a different \"niche\", to be different from the others. &nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>The goal is for this group to be different in:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. Adventurous trips, whether in the U S or abroad. But that's not all we are, Some other groups do that, read on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. This is NOT a for-profit group. I, the founder and original organizer, am not seeking any compensation for trips or otherwise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. It is my concept that unlike some other groups, the \"organizer\" of a trip will not go for free, subsidized by increasing the costs of others. &nbsp;I do not criticize other groups that work that way, I have been on some wonderful trips with some, but I'm going to experiment with this group being different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. While the organizer of a trip will not go for free, it is my goal\/hope that many others who participate in an event will share the planning. Perhaps one person will investigate air fares, another where to stay, another what to do there, etc. Time will tell if this works out. The work to be done by any one person may be as minimal as making a phone call to an airline, calling a hostel, or a few minutes research on the internet. &nbsp;It's very little work if spread out, but a lot of work for one person to do by themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. There is no minimal threshhold for how adventurous the trip will be. It may be to the wilds of Borneo or a weekend in Marthas Vineyard, biking and staying in a hostel. &nbsp;This is not MY group, it's OURS. Are you looking for someone, one person or more to accompany you on a standard-type cruise? A night at a concert? POST IT, become an event organizer, just contact me to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. In some situations we will be able to save our members a lot of money on great trips compared to other commercial companies and meetup groups. EXAMPLE: Machu Pichu (Peru). Typically, a trip there with a guide up the \"Inca Trail\" is advertised at about $1700 plus air fare. From my research, a gude must be a Peru-based licensed guiding company. Therefore someone here can only subcontract it out to a local guiding company. From my research, the best Peru-based guiding company is \"Llama Path\". They have almost 500 Trip Advisor reviews with an average 5 stars. I called them. Cost if booked directly through them, for a group, about $600 each (as of 2015 prices). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Couples as well as singles will be welcome. &nbsp;Some people would like to do this type of adventurous traveling but need someone or others to go with them.

We will have general discussion over supper, followed by a lecture or book review by a member, followed by questions and discussion on the presentation. Anyone may volunteer a talk at a previous meeting or electronically (they should have attended at least once), as long as the group feels the topic is of general interest to members. Talks should be aimed at the non-specialized scientific listener, but may include some well-explained math, if the topic requires it (e.g., for physics or math topics). Speakers are encouraged to provide a copy of typed notes for each attendee at the meeting, especially if there are pictures, diagrams or math involved, and may also attach notes to the meeting announcement, which will be made available to members at least a week beforehand. Book reviews should not assume attendees have read the book, though they are invited to do so. Occasionally, a science-based science fiction book or film may be chosen for review. Book reviews may include selected readings aloud from the book by the presenter. Blackboards will not be available, and LCD displays will not be convenient (except for occasional photos), as attendees may sit at a long table.<\/p>\n<p>Currently we are meeting at Four Burgers, 704 Mass Ave, Central Square, Cambridge, from 7-10 pm. The talk will begin about 8 pm. People may arrive as early as 6 pm and stay till at least 11 pm if they wish. Four Burgers&nbsp;features locally-sourced, grass-fed beef, vegetarian, turkey and wild salmon burgers.<\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184805336,"name":"Murray E.

Try to answer to 2 easy questions to avoid misunderstandings: - why women? is because you hate men? - No, although men are weirds (kidding ... some of my best friends are men). It seems I am weird because I don't find women in this particular field of developing bioinformatics tools (see this, for instance: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors<\/a>. Only a few out of 23 contributors. And this is one of the most collaborative tools I know) - and ... why? maybe women don't want this ... - well, I want to know if that is true, or whether there is another cultural reason behind that. I can not find any reason why women wouldn't be interested in developing bioinformatics tools. If there is, maybe I find what it is and I can publish a Nature paper (kidding again ...) Another experience was the last hackathons of codeFest (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014<\/a>), where only there were two women out of 60 people... I just don't believe that there are no more like me... I am weird but not because of working on this. So, please, if you are interested in learn <b>how to develop<\/b> tools in Bioinformatics, <b>or you already do<\/b>, but feel alone (kidding again) ... just join the meetup and help to increase woman population in this field. The idea of this group is to be a proxy to the developer community (for now men dominated) with the hope to get a great balance in the field (and hope one day this group disappears).

In a Circlesong, a leader starts by improvising a line of music and gives it \/ teaches it to one part of the circle. The leader then develops a second part that goes with the first and gives that part to another section of the circle. Circlesingers learn and repeat the exact part given to them. Soon we are singing a four part (at least) chorus that has never been sung before. This chorus can support individual solos.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>The effect: never-before-sung, wordless, fun songs, melodies, harmonies, &amp;amp; rhythms. The music may be glorious or goofy, complex or simple. Each circle is a unique experience, created by a spontaneously collaborating community.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>This is a \"mistake-free\" zone, for all levels of singers &nbsp;- &nbsp;we sing for the sheer fun of it! Sing beautiful harmonies without sheet music. Witness a circle of people creating music together. Come sing with us! Participants find it a joyful, exhilarating (and many have said spiritual) experience. Improvising and music-making can give insight into other life issues. Many notice cooperation, teamwork, and community.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We take inspiration from methods developed by the unique and illustrious Bobby McFerrin and his collaborators, and from Circlesinging groups in cities around the US and the world.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>More about Circlesinging:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are new to Circlesinging, you can hear and see examples in the videos below:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1 - &nbsp; In the following video, Bobby McFerrin creates a Circlesong with audience members, then riffs on top of it.

Whether you're a Jazz Newbie, a die-hard Enthusiast or a Jazz Musician, this MeetUp group brings together those who love America's first - and greatest - original art-form. - Are you a Jazz Novice? Here's a chance to do so by listening to it and talking about it with both enthusiasts and the musicians who create it. - Do you love to play Jazz? Unlike other sessions and jams, here's a chance to do so, and to engage with those who come to listen in-between sets. - Are you a Jazz Enthusiast? Want to share your knowledge (\"who played cornet on Jacque St. Clair's recording of 'Vital Stats'?\") with musicians - or even with newbies who've yet to explore the world of Jazz that you love? If any of these describe you, then this MeetUp is for you. Forged from Delta Blues, infused with African and Latin rhythms, and using American energy and ingenuity to push the limits of harmonic and melodic boundaries, Jazz can bring together peoples of a wide variety of backgrounds, regardless of class, ethnicity or education.

Dancing provides balance from what ever busy-ness or non-activity you\u2019ve been engaged in. Dancing your heart out allows you to process and integrate the challenges you've needed to face. In this sage and expressive practice you can expand your sense of connection to yourself, &nbsp;to others and the \"divine\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each class comes with a new playlist of music, new suggestions for movement, and of course, you will be in a new place each time you come.

Each class is designed to bring you into the most powerful, loving and inspired connection to yourself. As a ritual practice over time, your self expression becomes freer, more confident, more varied. Your sense of who you are and what you can accomplish expands. You may enter into a state of BLISS.

A labyrinth offers only one path into the center, and the same path back out. Although there are turns to negotiate, there are no blind alleys, dead ends, or tricks - as in a maze. In fact, quite the opposite - the ancient design of a labyrinth was created for the powerful purpose of allowing you to completely trust the path you are on, to let your mind simply rest, that your spirit might find its way to your inner center along the path.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of labyrinths in all kinds of media (stones, earth, portable painted canvases), has had a great resurgence in recent years. There are many labyrinths in this area. <b>I would love for this group site to become a channel for folks to plan walks, connect and explore labyrinths all around.<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I also encourage this space to be a community center of information for sharing and learning about labyrinths and the practice of labyrinth walking together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this is of interest to you, please join us. I look forward to walking with you!<\/p>\n<p>...a quote from <i>The Way of the Labyrinth<\/i> by Helen Curry: <i>\u201cPeople come to labyrinths for a multitude of reasons, but most find that walking a labyrinth can be a transformative experience. As people tread through the turns and counterturns, the world begins to drop away. Walking, breathing, being - things that we never think about in the day-to-day whirl of life - become conscious and deliberate. The spiritual and physical merge into a walking meditation. Our pace becomes a background rhythm against which we are able to clear our minds.\u201d<\/i><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/highres_443276901.jpeg","photo_id":443276901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/600_443276901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/4\/5\/thumb_443276901.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8514806,"name":"Katrina ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/highres_246462850.jpeg","photo_id":246462850,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/member_246462850.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/7\/6\/2\/thumb_246462850.jpeg"}},"members":264,"name":"Labyrinth Walking","id":18621831,"state":"MA","urlname":"Labyrinth-Walking","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Labyrinth Walkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432606198000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"dads","name":"Dads","id":468},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"sahd","name":"Stay-at-Home Dads","id":2140},{"urlkey":"sahp","name":"Stay at Home Parents","id":10060},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"moms-and-dads-group","name":"Moms and Dads Group","id":29314},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Downtown-Boston-Parents\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Got a baby?
