Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

A household name as the host of 'Rise and Shine', the country's highest-rated morning talk show, Meghan cuts to a commercial break, but not before she mutters two forbidden words into her open mike. In an instant, it's the end of an era - not only for Meghan, who is unaccustomed to dealing with adversity, but also for her younger sister, Bridget, a social worker in the Bronx who has always lived in Meghan's long shadow. The effect of Meghan's on-air truth-telling reverberates through both of their lives, affecting Meghan's son, husband, friends, and fans, as well as Bridget's perception of her sister, their complex childhood, and herself. What follows is a story about how, in very different ways, the Fitzmaurice women adapt, survive, and manage to bring the whole teeming world of New York to heel, by dint of their smart mouths, quick wits, and the powerful connection between them that even the worst tragedy cannot shatter.<\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please Bring a Chick Lit\/Women's Fiction book (that is out in paperback)!<\/b><\/p> <p>Not sure what to bring?<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Chick Lit: Chick lit is genre fiction within women's fiction which addresses issues of modern women often humorously and lightheartedly*<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Women's Fiction: a modern novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth.

Adibi calls these paintings \u201cRespiration Paintings\u201d because she sees them as existing not only as physical objects, but also in the air; when they are first exhibited, the paintings emit scents that allow an audience to breathe them as well as see them. While her use of aromatherapy oils in oil painting is new, plant oils such as linseed and safflower have been used since the beginning of oil painting. Adibi\u2019s paintings investigate the etheric substance that binds together the viewer and the painting through a living force. Her use of plant oils connects contemporary abstract painting to its pre-modern history of materials, engaging the tradition of oil painting and renewing its potential for healing through a recovered connection to the natural world.<\/p> <p>Elise Adibi currently has a studio at 7800 Susquehanna Street and is working on an upcoming show for the greenhouse at The Frick Pittsburgh in 2017. Adibi received a MFA from Columbia University, she also has a BA in Philosophy from Swarthmore College, and a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. In 2013 and 2014 Adibi was a Fellow at The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. She has twice received grants from The Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and in 2007, The Terra Foundation awarded her a fellowship in Giverny, France (Monet\u2019s village). In 2010, Adibi worked with the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts\/Pittsburgh Filmmakers to curate \u201cGold in Braddock\u201d at UnSmoke Art Systems. In 2011, Adibi was included in the Pittsburgh Biennial,\u201cGertrude\u2019s\/LOT,\u201d at The Andy Warhol Museum, curated by Eric Shiner.

Musically, these vastly different aspects of the story are somehow made harmonious, even essential, through a series of contemplative choral moments and solo arias by which we, the audience, are called upon to contemplate our own strengths and weaknesses and to see for ourselves how our own choices hold up under the scrutiny provided by the story of a man whose final days might be viewed as an exemplary, and utterly human, moment of moral reserve and psychological triumph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this production, my hope is to present the Passion against a backdrop of images from our daily lives: familiar, almost banal moments of daily reality, acts of love and selfishness, anguish and joy, of choices made, for better or worse, of the promise of a better life through technology and endless goods and services, and also of misery, routine violence and nonstop fear of \u201cthe other.\u201d In developing this production, I found myself inspired by Bach\u2019s\u00a0<i>St. John Passion<\/i>\u00a0to think deeply about my own life and personal choices. The piece seems to conclude with the provocative notion that there is no \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d but rather a complicated, sometimes beautiful, sometimes savage, fabric of individuals and groups called humanity, from which emerges equal parts love, compassion, courage, hatred, anger and a thousand other emotions and actions. I hope others may find opportunities for reflection as well; to feel caught up in both the Passion itself, and in that wonderful spell that music and drama can cast upon us.<\/p> <p>\u2014Sam Helfrich<\/p> <p><b>Parking<\/b> Here is the ParkPGH website with real-time info on downtown parking garage availability <a href=\"http:\/\/parkpgh.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/parkpgh.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/parkpgh.org<\/a><\/a> where you can also download apps, get garage availability via text messaging, etc. You can also call[masked]-8980.<\/p> <p>Stay tuned for updates!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"For discount tickets, please meet inside Heinz Hall Box Office by 1:15 PM.

Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players.

Here's an Amazon.com Review:<\/p> <p>\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b\/?node=390919011\">An Amazon Best Book of April 2015:<\/a>\u00a0Once upon a time, a couple or few decades ago, most American boys and girls in grade school were taught grammar and punctuation; we learned, for example, that \u201ci\u201d came before \u201ce,\u201d except after \u201cc\u201d (except sometimes, but never mind) and that the verb \u201cto be\u201d was \u201clike an equal sign,\u201d which meant that you used the nominative case (have I lost you yet?) on both sides of it. (\u201cIt is I,\u201d in other words, is the correct, if dowdy, response to \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d) Some of us were even taught to diagram sentences; some had parents who corrected us at the family dinner table. (I can still hear my father pressing the subjunctive upon me. \u201cIf I WERE,\u201d he\u2019d bellow, when I allowed as how there\u2019d be later curfews if I \u201cwas\u201d in charge.) Whether they retained the lessons or not, most people probably don't wax romantic about the grammar lessons or teachers of yore.<\/p> <p>Which is why even those of you who don\u2019t have the soul of a second-grade grammar teacher will love\u00a0Between You and Me, the hilarious and delightful \u201cmemoir\u201d by the longtime\u00a0New Yorkercopy editor, Mary Norris, who confides in the subtitle that she is a \u201ccomma queen.\u201d (The above is not a full sentence, I know -- but I think I can get away with it by calling it \"my style.\" Also, I put quotation marks around the word \u201cmemoir,\u201d Mary \u2013 I know you\u2019re wondering -- because I was trying to make the point that your book is an unusual take on the form, dealing as it does with thats and whiches as well as with your Ohio adolescence as a foot-checker at the local pool.) Who knew grammar could be so much fun -- that silly marks of punctuation could be so wickedly anthropomorphized (a question mark is like a lazy person), that dashes grow in families (there are big dashes and little dashes and they can all live peaceably within one sentence), that there was once a serious movement to solve the he-or-she problem with the catchall \u201cheesh\u201d? Clearly, Norris knows: her book is plenty smart, but it\u2019s its (one\u2019s a contraction, one\u2019s a possessive) joyful, generous style that makes it so winning. This is a celebration of language that won\u2019t make anyone feel dumb \u2013 but it\u2019s also the perfect gift for the coworker you haven\u2019t been able to tell that \u201cbetween\u201d is a preposition that never, ever, takes an object that includes the pronoun \u201cI.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Sara Nelson<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greensburg-Girls\/events\/228814014\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Book Club!","id":"228814014","time":1457568000000,"updated":1457581126000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1410467387000,"name":"Greensburg Girls: A 20's and 30's Social Group","group_lon":-79.6100006104,"id":16942182,"urlname":"Greensburg-Girls","group_lat":40.3300018311,"who":"Girls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1531 Mayview Rd ","name":"The Outdoor Classroom","lon":-80.110611,"id":23892914,"state":"PA","lat":40.336674,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.5267353058,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455200121000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you love all creatures scaly?

These are tennis players who love the sport and joined the program to meet up with you on the courts. The Partner Program is less competitive as there are no champions crowned and no league standings. The program provides dedicated tennis partners who want to meet up with you on the courts.<\/p> <p>\u00a0PittsburghTennis's tennis partner program is broken down to these playing regions: Pittsburgh.<\/p> <p>\u00a0The partner program is a monthly subscription service. The Partner Program is ongoing and remains open as long as the weather is good enough to play outdoor tennis. This is NOT a doubles program.<\/p> <p><b>Your Task-\"Scheduling and Meeting up with the other players\"<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 You meet up with the players to play either a match or just hit around. PittsburghTennis's objective to ensure players are actively playing. We try to use an incentive system to push players along. Anyone who plays 3 different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service for free.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The league strongly suggests that players jointly choose a tennis court location convenient to both. We now geo-locate your program contacts which means you should receive partners closer to your preferred playing location. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburghtennisleague.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> for each area, including details such as # of courts, lighting, hitting walls and links to google maps for directions. Members can submit court ratings on the overall condition, surface, lighting quality, facility management, and general comments regarding specific courts. This will provide players with up-to-date court information on new and existing courts. We encourage members to keep this list fresh and up-to-date.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The Partner Program is for all level players. We encourage beginners to play in the Partner Program prior to playing in a league. We track the results of the Partner Program and may make skill rating adjustments based upon scores if necessary. Our program ensures fun, well-matched tennis partners for players of all levels.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Price is variable depending on the # of months the player purchases. But it\u2019s typically not more than $10\/month. Any player that plays 3 or more different partners in a calendar month will get another month of service at no cost. In some *NEW* cities the program will be free as we are trying to build a dedicated tennis playing community.

In 1909 an ailing German explorer is searching for an exceedingly rare flower that he believes could cure him of his fatal illness. A young shaman and ostensibly the last member of a decimated tribe is resentful of whites but offers to help on the condition that they will lead him to other surviving members of his tribe. Meanwhile, a parallel narrative set in 1940 follows American explorer, Richard Evans Schultes, on his own search for the elusive flower, in an Amazonian landscape brutalized by the rubber trade. The luscious black and white cinematography is never just pretty, there is always something unsettling and dark lurking in its corners. This is Columbia\u2019s first-ever best foreign language Oscar nominee. In Spanish and Amazonian with subtitles.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

So this is a victory point race, and the Gem Dealer with the highest score during the round that a player first achieves 15 cumulative victory points will win. \u00a0One will do that by trading gems for places that will produce gems for them on all of their future turns. \u00a0These parts of your supply chain may carry impressive victory points of their own, and some victory points are gained by being the first dealer that can fill a difficult order for a waiting noble.<\/p> <p>The bookstore is running the event, and all questions about how many seats are available and similar concerns should be directed to them.

War, it seems, should be black and white, but what happens when a commander\u2019s decision to save one of his men results in the death of innocent civilians? Who is to blame? Whose lives are more valuable? This is the gray area inhabited by Academy Award nominated<i> A War<\/i>.

The paired words \"<b><i>Sacred Pain<\/i><\/b>\" often provoke immediate reactions from curiosity to resistance to disdain, fear or relief.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>A phrase coined by Amy to describe the commonality of the human experience: the <b>culmination of pain and struggles that all of us experience on our life journey<\/b>. Sacred Pain is also the <b>pain that we automatically brace against, resist, or tense to<\/b> on a physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual level. \u00a0This \"tensing to\" and \"resisting\" pain in our life is what creates suffering, not the actual pain itself. It is counter-intuitive to embrace and accept our pain, so it is not our \"go to\" response to do so. \u00a0It takes training and guidance to accept our pain and revere it in a way that allows us to accept the <b><i>gifts of Sacred Pain<\/i><\/b>. \u00a0Our pain is worthy of being revered, honored, and held with care, and compassion. Sacred Pain affords us the gifts of peace, healing, love, compassion, and wisdom. You may have great resistance to these truths, which is a normal initial response. Amy will describe how pain can afford these opportunities.\u00a0Ultimately, it is through our deepest, darkest, scariest experiences that we have the opportunity to the most significant growth in our life journey.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This seminar will further discuss these concepts, <b>as Amy demonstrates creating a vessel for <i>her S<\/i>acred Pain<\/b> - an experience you won't want to miss! Through <b>sharing her story of adversity and resiliency,<\/b> in passion and strength, you will <b>observe the embodiment of Radical Acceptance<\/b>\u00a0with pain (practice of mindfulness &amp; compassion). A seminar that will empower and inspire you to practice the same skills with your Sacred Pain.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~<\/p> <p><i><b>Stay tuned<\/b><\/i> for additional seminars related to the concept of Sacred Pain, Mindfulness, Wellness, Spirituality &amp; More!

KNOWN FOR GREAT FOOD AND HIGH QUALITY BEER SELECTION.<\/p> <p>Celestial Gold ABV: 4.0%<br\/>Golden in color with a light, bubbly effervescence. From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma and a light malt taste. Pipe Organ Pale Ale ABV: 5.2%<br\/>Brewed with a hefty amount of pale malt and loads of Galaxy Hops, this beer is a medium bodied ale with a light malt sweetness from the use of caramel malts. Balanced and sure to please, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale finishes crisp and citrusy with hints of peach and passionfruit.<\/p> <p>Pious Monk Dunkel ABV: 5.5%<br\/>The body is mellow and the alcohol content is low. It has a wonderful clean and roasty aroma and finishes crisp and clean as a lager should.<\/p> <p>Rotating Stout<br\/>Today there are many different variations of stout available all over the world. To celebrate this diversity, we constantly rotate our stout selection. We might be brewing an old favorite or experimenting with a new batch, so ask your server what's on tap.<\/p> <p>ThunderHop IPA ABV \u2013 6.5%<br\/>Intense bitterness, flavor and aroma. Hopped with an equal blend of Chinook and Nugget hops resulting an herbal, pine, citrus and grapefruit aroma and flavor. The color is copper to amber, just a bit darker than the Pipe Organ Pale Ale. The body is big and malty with some caramel sweetness.<\/p> <p>Short-Day Dunkelweizen ABV - 5.5%<br\/>Dark amber brown with a bit of a haze due to the yeast. The aroma is very complex. It has some of the banana\/clove-like aromas that original Hefeweizen has, but it also has a mixture of bread-like and chocolate-like overtones. The body is light to medium with a slight amount of residual sweetness. It will finish with the soft flavor of a wheat beer and no lingering hop bitterness.<\/p> <p>Rufus Dark Saison ABV - 6.6%<br\/>Dark brown with a beige head. Notes of hazelnuts, chocolate, and wood blend well with the light peppery zing from the Wallonian yeast and white peppercorn addition. We also made this with bitter orange peel and coriander to balance out the darker flavors. Dark saisons are a newer sub-style of the traditional farmhouse ale, and to play with it even more, we made ours with rye instead of wheat.<\/p> <p>Renegade Black IPA ABV \u2013 6.0%<br\/>This beer isn\u2019t quite a stout but it\u2019s too dark to be an IPA. It might start out tasting kinda like a dry stout, but then the grassy and citrusy Amarillo hops kick in. We used Amarillos for bittering and the flavor\/aroma additions. Judging that to be insufficient, we then dry-hopped the beer with Amarillos. We like the way Amarillos taste in this beer, so we went for it. Cherry Quadzilla ABV: 10.3%<br\/>The color is amber with some red hues and it also holds a nice rich head. The aroma will be distinctively Belgian in character. You will notice lots of fruit like esters and some roasted malt undertones. The body is full with bread-like maltiness and a bit of a lingering caramel sweetness. As the beer finishes you will get a slight balancing bitterness and then an alcohol warming effect. One interesting note: notice how the complexity of the Cherry Quad increases as the beer warms in your glass.<\/p> <p>Spring Hill Sour ABV: 5.4%<br\/>Pale, tart, and refreshing -- it\u2019s Berliner Weisse! We used apples in both the mash and fermenter using only hand-picked apples.<\/p> <p>Mad Mardigan\u2019s Spiced Baltic Porter ABV: 7.5%<br\/>A light mocha head and a dark brown color. The black cardamom we spiced it with gives it an apparent smokey, resinous aroma -- perfect for winter. The flavor has some slight sweetness (apt for the style) to balance out the spices and hint of Black malt.<\/p> <p>Cask Ale Selection<br\/>Our brewers offer a rotating real ale naturally carbonated in the firkin, sometimes adding interesting ingredients or additional hops, and served on a traditional hand pump in a 20oz Imperial Pint. The beer will change every week, so be sure to ask what's on today!<\/p> <p>Some history:<br\/>History of St. John's the Baptist and Lawrenceville<br\/>In the days before industry invaded its boundaries or paved roads curled through its neighborhoods, when Pittsburgh was in its youth, there was a farm called \"Good Liquor\" outside of the city. Owned by Alexander Hill, part of the farm was located within the existing Lawrenceville border. Later on, in 1814, William B. Foster purchased a 133-acre tract of land outside of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River. In that same year, he would sell 30 acres of that property to the Federal Government. While Allegheny Arsenal was being built to provide supplies to the warring Union Troops during the civil war, Foster was starting to establish a community called Lawrenceville. The picturesque area was named for Captain James Lawrence who gained fame in the war with Britain. He was captain of the Chesapeake and his famous saying \"Don't give up the ship!\" was incorporated in the borough seal of Lawrenceville.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Bar-Meet-Ups\/events\/228678284\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"CHURCH BREW WORKS","id":"228678284","time":1458340200000,"updated":1458352120000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1453586240000,"name":"Pittsburgh 20s Bar Meet Ups","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":19421508,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Bar-Meet-Ups","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Pgh Bar Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"31 North Balph Ave","name":"The Artists' Gallery","lon":-80.055374,"id":24063288,"state":"PA","lat":40.496185,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.8379945755,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454611418000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/2\/0\/600_446538720.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FINE ART GALLERY EXHIBITION\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PRESENTED by \"ARTISTS' GALLERY\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 FEATURING THE ARTWORK OF\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ARNE HANSEN AND GORDON SATRI\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Exhibit Receptions\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 Friday &amp; Saturday \u2013 March[masked]:30 PM \u2013 8:30 PM<br\/>\u00a0\nGet your creative juices flowing by celebrating the 2016 Artists\u2019 Gallery\u2019s \u201cArt Gallery Weekend Event Series\u201d of monthly exhibitions.

While the Kora is only 300 years old, some commonly played songs can be traced back 800 years to the founding of the Mande empires.

Moreover, many of the methods for building these systems don\u2019t require years of study before you can apply them. In this talk, Ted will present examples of key principles that really matter in making choices about data, algorithms and architecture when you build practical learning systems, as well as other key learning that come from his experience.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Agenda:<\/p> <p>7:00pm: Refreshments<\/p> <p>7:15pm: Announcements<\/p> <p>7:25pm - Tech Talk<\/p> <p>8:10pm - Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>8:25pm - Conversations<\/p> <p>8:55pm - Departure<\/p> <p>Speaker's Bio:<\/p> <p>Ted Dunning is Chief Application Architect at MapR Technologies and committer and PMC member of the Apache Mahout, Apache ZooKeeper, and Apache Drill projects .

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly. All you have to do is show up ready to play!<\/p> <p><b>Pricing:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$7 - RSVP online and pay in advance (online rsvp closes at 4:30 pm!)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$9 - RSVP and pay cash at the event<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$10 - Show up and play - be sure to check online to make sure there is room!<\/p> <p><b>What to Wear:<\/b> We are playing indoors on a rubberized all-sport surface. Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/229427044\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"tjmnrlyvfbdc","time":1458691200000,"updated":1458700314000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.7600021362,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Volleyball Monsters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"1900 Murray Ave","name":"Pastoli's Pizza, Pasta & Paisans","lon":-79.922844,"id":23943094,"lat":40.435764,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":2.76845598221,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458427833000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Acoustic open mic night.

Details below or message me. Hope you can join us!<\/p> <p><br\/>Ladies-- Thank you for the interest in this group! Bootcamp is in session starting Monday, March 28 through Sunday, April 17! We'll be following the 21 Day Fix program, which includes 7 30-minute at home workouts (requiring a light and heavy set of dumbbells) and a meal plan based on color-coded containers. I'll set up a private Facebook group for participants for daily check-ins, motivation and support. I started doing the program after my first son was born in October 2013 and have been doing it post-baby #2, who arrived in October 2015. I LOVE the workouts and the meal plan and find that it's perfect for busy moms-- 30 minute workouts at home (that you can do even with the kiddos hanging around) and awesome recipes that the whole family enjoys (and let's you stop feeling like an unappreciated short order cook). I'm a lawyer by day and mom all the time and this program has allowed me to get back into and stay in shape with minimal time and effort. If you have the program already, awesome! If not, I'll include links below. **Please note that I am a Beachbody coach (essentially a rep) and do earn commissions from sales, half of which will be donated to Magee's NICU for March and April. Back story-- our first son arrived early and spent some time in the NICU after birth. Our experience there, while emotionally taxing and difficult, was pretty amazing and, as a result, my husband and I are committed to supporting the NICU and other parents with children currently there. I'm a coach for the fun of it so thought that donating commissions might be a nice, additional way to support the NICU.<\/p> <p>In any event, I hope that you'll join us for this program!

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.
