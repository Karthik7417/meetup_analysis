We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play.

We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players.

Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons, consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate.<\/p> <p>For example, blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look at the subject matter, lighting, colors, shapes, and textures, and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image.

Nelly (Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, has survived a concentration camp, but with her face disfigured by a bullet wound. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Nelly emerges with a new face, one similar but different enough that her former husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), doesn\u2019t recognize her. Rather than reveal herself, Nelly walks into a dangerous game of duplicity and disguise as she tries to figure out if the man she loves may have been the one who betrayed her to the Nazis. Evoking the shadows and haunted mood of post-war Berlin, Phoenix weaves a complex tale of a nation\u2019s tragedy and a woman\u2019s search for answers as it builds towards an unforgettable, heart-stopping climax.

Hagan. Plans to build a church were halted due to the crash of 1929. After World War II and the revival of the steel plants, work once again began in earnest towards the creation of this beautiful church and school. St. Therese of Lisieux School was blessed on August 21, 1954. Mass was first celebrated in the basement of this new school until St. Therese of Lisieux Church was finally completed and put into faithful service beginning in 1958. St. Therese of Lisieux Church is a beautiful church with many unique elements that add to the charm of this House of Worship. It contains a unique chapel dedicated to this beloved saint who is called \u201cThe Little Flower of Jesus\u201d. It contains both first and second class relics of this doctor of the Catholic Church, made famous in part by her best-selling autobiography, \u201cThe Story of a Soul\u201d. It also contains distinct stained glass windows that lovingly tell the stories from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as pageants of Pittsburgh scenes, honoring the lives of some of the hardworking people that helped make our city what she is today. Just recently St. Therese's church made the news when one of it's bells was repaired and reinstalled. If you would like to see the video honoring this event, the link is here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mGkl-cAqD-Q\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mGkl-cAqD-Q<\/a><\/p> <p>As you can tell from this video, this is truly a fun-loving Faith community!<\/p> <p>The reason that Father and I chose this date is that this is the Sunday when St. Therese of Lisieux's church celebrates the feast day of their patron saint by finishing their nine-day novena to her, as well as hosting a procession outside the church in honor of her.

Hagan. Plans to build a church were halted due to the crash of 1929. After World War II and the revival of the steel plants, work once again began in earnest towards the creation of this beautiful church and school. St. Therese of Lisieux School was blessed on August 21, 1954. Mass was first celebrated in the basement of this new school until St. Therese of Lisieux Church was finally completed and put into faithful service beginning in 1958. St. Therese of Lisieux Church is a beautiful church with many unique elements that add to the charm of this House of Worship. It contains a unique chapel dedicated to this beloved saint who is called \u201cThe Little Flower of Jesus\u201d. It contains both first and second class relics of this doctor of the Catholic Church, made famous in part by her best-selling autobiography, \u201cThe Story of a Soul\u201d. It also contains distinct stained glass windows that lovingly tell the stories from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as pageants of Pittsburgh scenes, honoring the lives of some of the hardworking people that helped make our city what she is today. Just recently St. Therese's church made the news when one of it's bells was repaired and reinstalled.

She will also be available by appointment[masked]-3104.<\/p> <p>Maya Rose has worked and recorded with various artists and musicians throughout the world. Deeply dedicated to SACRED SOUND, she activates the memory of paradise in our hearts and the Earth through her celestial voice. Her voice helps activate our DNA, our multidimensional selves, and leads us into a journey from pristine oceans to endless dimensions in parallel realities and endless multiverses. During her presentations, listeners perceive the presence of many angels, nature spirits, ascended masters, and sometimes ...the smell of roses. Besides deep emotional and spiritual healing, sometimes spontaneous physical healings happen as well when she sings. Maya connects our hearts to the heart of the Earth and the heart of Heaven, with all that is contained in the endless ocean of Love. In her songs and paintings, Maya brings forth a language of Light, which she has been speaking since childhood. This is a combination of words in Sanskrit, Asian languages, Hebrew, Indian indigenous and star languages.<\/p> <p>Maya was born in Germany, at the age of 16 saw the vision of a mountain village in Mexico, where she would meet part of her soul family. After giving birth to 3 children, she traveled with two of her children through South America, from Peru to Mexico, arriving at the Mexican border on her 33th birthday, the 26th of July, 1992. Later, she was guided to Tepoztlan, where she has lived for the last 16 years. When she arrived in Tepoztlan, she recognized it as the place she had dreamt about and painted at the age of 16. This was a time for raising her children, going deep inside, working with different musicians, painting, dreaming, creating, holding and balancing the energy in this very particular place.<br\/>Apart from singing for people, over the years she has felt a call from Earth to travel and sing in certain places. Rocks, mountains, rivers, oceans... In order to anchor love frequencies, and cleanse memories of pain, war, etc., in certain areas. This is sound acupuncture for Mother Earth. Maya has recently been traveling in South America, following some kind of Earth emergency call, starting at the top of Machu Picchu in December, 2014, and from there to many other different places. Sometimes, it can be a little extreme, traveling for 3 days by bus, just to sing a song in the middle of nowhere. Now again she feels the call to travel, this time north, serving through her gifts to raise and anchor the vibration of the love wave from the infinite ocean of love.<br\/>Maya does sound healing group work or one on one. She sings a special song for each person with lying of hands where she is guided. Her voice creates amazing vortexes of pure love. She aligns people\u2019s chakras, opening them up, and bringing their soul back into balance.<br\/>783 Route 908 Ext.

Nowhere is the situation more desperate than in India, where every 30 minutes one farmer, deep in debt and unable to provide for his family, commits suicide. It's an epidemic, which has claimed over a quarter million lives.<\/p> <p>Following a U.S. complaint to the World Trade Organization, India had to open its doors to foreign seed companies like the U.S.-based Monsanto. Now only genetically modified (GM) seeds for some major crops are available at the seed shops. The GM seeds are much more expensive; in addition to precious water, they need additional fertilizers and insecticides and must be re-purchased every season. Large farms have prospered, but the majority of farmers are now struggling to make a living off their land.<\/p> <p>Ram Krishna, a cotton farmer at the epicenter of the suicide crisis region, is struggling to keep his land. Manjusha, the neighbors' daughter, is determined to overcome village traditions and become a journalist. Ram Krishna's plight becomes her first assignment.<\/p> <p>BITTER SEEDS raises critical questions about the human cost of genetically modified agriculture and the future of how we grow things.<\/p> <p>Bitter Seeds screens Sunday, October 4th at 6 PM at Sanger Lecture Hall which is inside Coolidge Hall.

Co-hosted by the Pittsburgh 2030 District, this walking tour offers you a unique chance to see four green roofs in Oakland. That\u2019s four tours in one! REGISTER NOW EXPERIENCE<br\/>Building owners and managers in Oakland have focused on energy efficiency for a long time, but since the Pittsburgh 2030 District expanded into Oakland last year, there are more opportunities than ever for these owners to learn, implement, and share their knowledge about healthy and high-performing buildings.<\/p> <p>Case in point: the green roof.<\/p> <p>Many Oakland (and Downtown, for that matter) buildings have them, but you wouldn\u2019t know it because you can\u2019t see them! Green roofs help reduce the heat island effect, assist in stormwater management, reduce building energy use, and can even be used for urban food production. On this tour, you\u2019ll get an in-depth look at four different green roofs, while also getting your daily exercise and exploring Oakland!<\/p> <p>Our tour will begin at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum and will continue on to University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Posvar Hall. From there, we\u2019ll head to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens and finally end our tour just before sunset at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Hamerschlag Hall.<\/p> <p>Each building will have staff members on hand to provide our private tour of their green roof. Don\u2019t miss this unique opportunity to get four tours in one, burn some calories, and explore one of Pittsburgh\u2019s coolest neighborhoods!<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll offer small snacks and portable drinks along the way. If everyone is interested in going out to dinner after the tour, we can hit up a local restaurant for dinner. *This tour has limited capacity.<\/p> <p>SCHEDULE<br\/>4:00 \u2013 4:30 \u2013 Meet at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What to Expect:\u00a0<\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Facility Information:<\/b>\u00a0Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What's included in the price?<\/b>\u00a0Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Questions?<\/b>\u00a0Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Her Guardian, the Lord Chancellor of the House of Lords, refuses to permit it, for he wishes for her to marry a Peer of the House.<\/p> <p>But this tale is just beginning\u2026 for the shepherd boy is Strephon, half fairy\/half mortal son of the Fairy Iolanthe, a friend of the Fairy Queen.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s NOT a good idea to anger the Fairy Queen! Fairies and Shepherds, Politicians and Soldiers, and a musical Masterpiece that delights one and all!<\/p> <p>Iolanthe is a fairy who married a human, and bore a son. That's bad. When caught, she was banished and family abandoned. As the opera opens, she is pardoned. Her son, Strephon, plans to marry Phyllis, a ward of the Lord High Chancellor of England (who cares for orphans as part of his official duties). Problem: Everyone in the House of Lords has fallen in love with Phyllis. Permission to marry her is denied, so Strephon calls on the fairies for help. They get him into Parliament, and ensure that any act he supports passes. The Lords are thrown into disarray by this short-circuit of power politics, and by competition over Phyllis. Finally the Chancellor decides to marry her himself. Iolanthe reveals herself as the Chancellor's long-lost wife, and is condemned to death again. How can Iolanthe's execution be stopped? How can Strephon and Phyllis get back together? How can the Lords be rid of the pestiferous Strephon and his infallible legislation?

This wonderfully quirky 1921 comedy was penned by the famous Pittsburgh native George S. Kaufman, often called Broadway's greatest comic playwright, and frequent collaborator Marc Connelly, a native of McKeesport who also\u00a0won a Pulitzer Prize for the play <i>\"The Green Pastures\"<\/i> in 1930.<\/p> <p>In\u00a0this new\u00a0rollicking production, directed by Corey Rieger, the setting is updated from the roaring '20s to 2015. This modern-day revival boasts an amazing cast of actors bringing life to a comedy classic that inspired two films. Don't miss the hilarity from the prolific master George S. Kaufman behind such classics\u00a0as\u00a0<i>\"You Can't Take It With You\"<\/i>, <i>\"The Man Who Came to Dinner\"<\/i>, several Marx brothers gems including <i>\"Animal Crackers\"<\/i> and <i>\"A Night at the Opera<\/i>\", and so much more.<\/p> <p>Don't miss this wonderful new\u00a0production of <b><i>\"Dulcy\"<\/i><\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews\u00a0about the show <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Of note is that it has\u00a0been 10 years since Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company's successful production of George S.

Verdi\u00a0commented that \"this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that <i>Nabucco<\/i> was born under a lucky star\".<\/p> <p>This opera follows the plight of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jews\">Jews<\/a> as they are assaulted, conquered and subsequently\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylonian_captivity\">exiled<\/a>\u00a0from their homeland by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylon\">Babylonian<\/a> King Nabucco (in English, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebuchadnezzar_II\">Nebuchadnezzar II<\/a>). The\u00a0opera is set\u00a0in 587 BC where\u00a0historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a><\/i> \/ \"Fly, thought, on golden wings\", a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today.<\/p> <p>What makes \"Nabucco\" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you'll get when Mark Delavan (who's sung previously\u00a0here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff, Rigoletto, and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who\u00a0takes both his daughters to war with him -- one daughter, gentle Fenena, is captured by the Hebrews, only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele, <i>nephew of the King of Jerusalem)<\/i>\u00a0while the other daughter, Abigaille, is consumed by ambition, frustration (she wants Ismaele), and rage against anything in her way, including her father. \u00a0The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big, traditional production. That most beloved of choruses, \"Va, pensiero.\" The poignant family story of betrayal and reconciliation at the heart of the opera.<\/p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews about this production in Pittsburgh <a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400\"><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB\"><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Check out this video of the Overture from Nabucco (as performed by the famous\u00a0Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in Germany) to get a sense of the powerful music as the opera begins<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jGhd5kGM7dk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jGhd5kGM7dk<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd this video of the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a>\u00a0from another opera production<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D6JN0l7A_mE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D6JN0l7A_mE<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Meetup Ticket Discount Offer<\/b><\/p> <p>Pittsburgh Opera is very graciously offering the Meetup a fantastic deal for\u00a0great seats for\u00a0a thrilling\u00a0\"Nabucco\" experience with its powerful music and\u00a0stunning set\/costumes.<\/p> <p>And for even more flexibility, Pittsburgh Opera is offering the discount for two performance dates\u00a0(so we'll be scheduling Meetup dates for each one)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Tuesday, October 13 at\u00a07 PM\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Friday,\u00a0October 16\u00a0at 7:30 PM<\/p> <p>Meetup\u00a0members\u00a0can purchase tickets to either performance for the following special prices:<\/p> <p>$40 for best available in Sections A &amp; B (regularly $102.75 to $157.75 in value) which are equivalent to the best seats on the Orchestra Floor or Directors Circle with\u00a0fantastic views to the stage.<\/p> <p>$20\u00a0for best available in Sections C &amp; D (regularly $42.75 to $79.75) which are equivalent to\u00a0really good\u00a0seats on the Orchestra Floor or First Tier\/lower Second Tier in the balcony with great views to the stage.<\/p> <p>This is a very generous offer and a wonderful opportunity to experience opera, especially for those that perhaps have never checked out classic opera before.\u00a0 Naturally, this offer is not intended to be a substitute for Pittsburgh Opera[masked] subscriptions which also have many benefits.<\/p> <p><b><i>If you prefer going on Friday, October 16 instead, please RSVP to other Meetup posting\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772259\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772259\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772259\/<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>With this special Meetup offer, please\u00a0note that you will be seated on the day of the show with the best available\u00a0seating in your selected sections.

This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What to Expect:\u00a0<\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Facility Information:<\/b>\u00a0Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What's included in the price?<\/b>\u00a0Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Questions?<\/b>\u00a0Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Verdi\u00a0commented that \"this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that <i>Nabucco<\/i> was born under a lucky star\".<\/p> <p>This opera follows the plight of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jews\">Jews<\/a> as they are assaulted, conquered and subsequently <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylonian_captivity\">exiled<\/a> from their homeland by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylon\">Babylonian<\/a> King Nabucco (in English, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebuchadnezzar_II\">Nebuchadnezzar II<\/a>). The\u00a0opera is set in 587 BC where\u00a0historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a><\/i> \/ \"Fly, thought, on golden wings\", a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today.<\/p> <p>What makes \"Nabucco\" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you'll get when Mark Delavan (who's sung previously\u00a0here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff, Rigoletto, and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who\u00a0takes both his daughters to war with him -- one daughter, gentle Fenena, is captured by the Hebrews, only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele, <i>nephew of the King of Jerusalem)<\/i>\u00a0while the other daughter, Abigaille, is consumed by ambition, frustration (she wants Ismaele), and rage against anything in her way, including her father. \u00a0The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big, traditional production. That most beloved of choruses, \"Va, pensiero.\" The poignant family story of betrayal and reconciliation at the heart of the opera.<\/p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews about this production in Pittsburgh <a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400\"><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9239028-74\/nabucco-opera-pittsburgh#axzz3oPOmM400<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music-reviews\/2015\/10\/12\/Music-review-Pittsburgh-Opera-opens-season-with-Nabucco\/stories\/201510120037<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB\"><a href=\"http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triblive.com\/aande\/theaterarts\/9184080-74\/opera-nabucco-verdi#axzz3oBekKWiB<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/music\/2015\/10\/08\/Opera-preview-Verdi-s-Nabucco-receives-first-Pittsburgh-Opera-staging-since-1973\/stories\/201510080013<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Check out this video of the Overture from Nabucco (as performed by the famous\u00a0Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in Germany) to get a sense of the powerful music as the opera begins<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jGhd5kGM7dk\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jGhd5kGM7dk<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd this video of the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a>\u00a0from another opera production<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D6JN0l7A_mE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D6JN0l7A_mE<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Meetup Ticket Discount Offer<\/b><\/p> <p>Pittsburgh Opera is very graciously offering the Meetup a fantastic deal for\u00a0great seats for\u00a0a thrilling\u00a0\"Nabucco\" experience with its powerful music and\u00a0stunning set\/costumes.<\/p> <p>And for even more flexibility, Pittsburgh Opera is offering the discount for two performance dates\u00a0(so we'll be scheduling Meetup dates for each one)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Tuesday, October 13 at\u00a07 PM\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Friday,\u00a0October 16\u00a0at 7:30 PM<\/p> <p>Meetup\u00a0members\u00a0can purchase tickets to either performance for the following special prices:<\/p> <p>$40 for best available in Sections A &amp; B (regularly $102.75 to $157.75 in value) which are equivalent to the best seats on the Orchestra Floor or Directors Circle with\u00a0fantastic views to the stage.<\/p> <p>$20\u00a0for best available in Sections C &amp; D (regularly $42.75 to $79.75) which are equivalent to\u00a0really good\u00a0seats on the Orchestra Floor or First Tier\/lower Second Tier in the balcony with great views to the stage.<\/p> <p>This is a very generous offer and a wonderful opportunity to experience opera, especially for those that perhaps have never checked out classic opera before.\u00a0 Naturally, this offer is not intended to be a substitute for Pittsburgh Opera[masked] subscriptions which also have many benefits.<\/p> <p><b><i>If you prefer going on Tuesday, October 13 instead, please RSVP to other Meetup posting\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772140\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772140\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Art-lovers\/events\/225772140\/<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>With this special Meetup offer, please\u00a0note that you will be seated on the day of the show with the best available\u00a0seating in your selected sections.

Yet the future of this industry is the subject of a highly charged debate being aired on the streets, in the press and at City Hall. Carriage operators say that horse-drawn carriages should stay because they are a cherished symbol of New York City that bring in tourist dollars. Animal rights activists say the industry should be banned because it\u2019s inhumane and unsafe. They believe Hollywood has romanticized horse-drawn carriages and claim that life on congested city streets is anything but romantic for nervous, prey animals.<\/p> <p>As a result of three fatal accidents since 2006 and a bill introduced at City Hall to ban horse-drawn carriages from NYC, the plight of the NYC carriage horses is now in the public eye more than ever before. But the public doesn\u2019t know much more than what they see on the streets and in the news.<\/p> <p>Through original footage taken with hidden cameras and interviews with carriage drivers, veterinarians, accident witnesses, animal rights activists, politicians, tourists, residents who live near the horses and people who have rescued NYC carriage horses from slaughter, BLINDERS takes viewers behind the scenes to expose the truth behind the tradition<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-vegans\/events\/225443315\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Vegan Book Club... film edition!

Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir.<\/p> <p>The Andrew Alden Ensemble is a contemporary and electronic chamber music group from Rochester, NY. Their goal is to bring forth new music for chamber music and film. The ensemble produces textual scores for film and performs them in front of a live audience to transform the picture with new sounds and experiences.<\/p> <p>The Andrew Alden Ensemble brings together a fascinating collaboration of rock music and contemporary classical composition including percussion, synthesizer, piano, violin, cello and electronic production. Their music combines the influence of Steve Reich, Philip Glass, David Lang, Radiohead, Velvet Underground and Krzysvtof Penderecki to create beautiful and haunting landscapes.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehollywooddormont.org\/calendar\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thehollywooddormont.org\/calendar\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/225543087\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari w\/ live music @ Hollywood Theatre","id":"225543087","time":1445194800000,"updated":1445209369000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.422.9650","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue","name":"Carnegie Library Squirrel Hill","lon":-79.922536,"id":882044,"state":"PA","lat":40.438137,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.63796234131,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437954103000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be working through lesson 8 in the book. \"Japanese for Busy People\" book 2 version 3. \u00a0 As usual, we'll meet in Classroom C.<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's try to figure out how we can improve upon what we are learning so that we can make it both more interactive and at the same time begin to really use our language skills. \u00a0Do we want to try having more quizzes? \u00a0Interactive dialog? \u00a0Roleplaying?<\/p> <p>Last week we left off at the end of Lesson 7, and decided to study the Lesson 7 Kanji, as well as the first three pages of the Lesson 7 workbook exercises.\u00a0 After we review those, we will pick up with Lesson 8.<\/p> <p>If anyone has any ideas for other things they'd like to try let me know.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are in Classroom C not far from the elevator.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JSGPITT\/events\/226007789\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Japanese Study Group level 1 Intermediate","id":"jfqmjlytnbxb","time":1445194800000,"updated":1445200760000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297574466000,"name":"Japanese Language Study Group","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":1782914,"urlname":"JSGPITT","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Japanese speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.422.9650","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue","name":"Carnegie Library Squirrel Hill","lon":-79.922536,"id":882044,"state":"PA","lat":40.438137,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.63796234131,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438989904000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi All,<\/p> <p>The text book for this class is An integrated approach to inter.mediate Japanese.<br\/>This class will be from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm.<\/p> <p>The location is the meeting room C of the Carnegie library squirrel hill.<br\/>Please RSVP and let me know if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>Let's try to think up some interesting ways to improve upon what we are learning. \u00a0Should we be taking regular quizzes or doing some other in class practice? \u00a0<\/p> <p>Last week we left off at the end of Lesson 5 and ready to move on to Lesson 6.\u00a0 If there is anything anyone would like to cover outside of the book or on any other topic, also please let us know.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be in Classrom C not far from the elevator","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JSGPITT\/events\/226007790\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Japanese study group level 2 for intermediate","id":"thntjlytnbxb","time":1445198400000,"updated":1445204525000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297574466000,"name":"Japanese Language Study Group","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":1782914,"urlname":"JSGPITT","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Japanese speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15206","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.901.4298","address_1":"6617 Hamilton Ave","name":"Absolute Ballroom Dancing","lon":-79.909891,"id":1120340,"state":"PA","lat":40.457782,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.27536725998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443018293000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>USA Sunday Dance held at different studio every month.

His first book, The First Modern Jew: Spinoza and the History of an Image, traces the shifting image of the seventeenth-century Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza in modern Jewish culture. It was co-winner of the 2012 American Academy for Jewish Research's Salo Wittmayer Baron Prize, and a finalist for the 2012 National Jewish Book Award in History. Professor Schwartz is currently working on a new research project, a genealogy of the ghetto that traces its evolution as a word, concept, metaphor, and place in both Jewish history and beyond Jewish contexts as such. His research interests include Jewish historical consciousness, early modern and modern Jewish identities, and Jewish intellectuals.<\/p> <p>The term ghetto is among the most fraught and freighted in the vocabulary of Jewish culture and history. Indeed, it has not only featured prominently in virtually all the major developments of modern Jewish history, from emancipation to antisemitism, from urbanization to suburbanization, and from mass migration to mass murder. The \u201cghetto\u201d has been fundamental to the very definition and constitution of Jewish modernity. For all this explosion of \u201cghetto-talk,\u201d the term has arguably become central to the collective history and identity of only one other people beyond Jews, namely African Americans. Ultimately, the story of the term\u2019s migration from Jewish to black concerns more than simply the changing nuance of a particular word. The transference of the ghetto was a semantic as much as a socioeconomic historical development, and indeed was understood as such.<\/p> <p>For more information contact: [masked] The event is sponsored by Jewish Studies and co-sponsored by the Department of Religious Studies, Department of History, Carnegie-Mellon Department of History, and the Humanities Center.<\/p> <p>Location and Address<br\/>Humanities Center<\/p> <p>602 Cathedral of Learning<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/226101780\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Pitt Lecture: From Jewish to Black: the Strange Career of the Word Ghetto","id":"226101780","time":1445286600000,"updated":1445299050000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15222","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"655 Penn Avenue","name":"Cabaret At Theater Square","lon":-80.001007,"id":6434262,"state":"PA","lat":40.443089,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.27014493942,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442878019000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/7\/3\/600_442279827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Please join us on October 19 as we continue our happy hour series downtown in the Cultural District.

Product Description<br\/>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<\/p> <p>When we deny our stories, they define us.<br\/>When we own our stories, we get to write the ending. Social scientist Bren\u00e9 Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability\u2014the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome\u2014is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people\u2014from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents\u2014shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they\u2019re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we\u2019re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It\u2019s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.<br\/>Product Description<br\/>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<\/p> <p>When we deny our stories, they define us.<br\/>When we own our stories, we get to write the ending.

The story is told from three character\u2019s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s wife, who happens to be Jess\/Megan\u2019s neighbor. Rachel\u2019s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess\/Megan\u2019s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn\u2019t. This is a book to be devoured.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>-Neal Thompson<\/i><\/p> <p>Please ask at the host stand for the book club.

Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

We Have Always Lived in the Castle is full of a macabre and sinister humor, and Merricat herself, its amiable narrator, is one of the great unhinged heroines of literature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Merricat has developed an idiosyncratic system of rules and protective magic, burying talismanic objects beneath the family estate, nailing them to trees, ritually revisiting them. But when a\u00a0stranger arrives, he disturbs the sisters' careful habits, installing himself at the head of the family table, unearthing Merricat's treasures. Unable to drive him away by either polite or occult means, Merricat adopts more desperate methods.<\/p> <p>Jackson's novel emerges less as a study in eccentricity and more as a powerful critique of the anxious, ruthless processes involved in the maintenance of normality itself. \"Poor strangers,\" says Merricat contentedly at last, studying trespassers from the darkness behind the barricaded Blackwood windows. \"They have so much to be afraid of.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Feel free to read more at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle\">Goodreads<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Approx.

In fact, the happier and more balanced you are, the more profoundly contributing you will be to this planet and everything living on it. On a spirit level, if every one of us decides to take better care of ourselves, if we decide to bring ourselves into balance, we can create a much improved future for ourselves, our children and our planet. But balance is sometimes easier to talk about, and long for than it is to attain. In our misguided efforts to achieve this desired balanced state, we often feel the solution is to become more active, to simply do more, to make more commitments in our already over-committed lives. This is the right approach; it sets us up for certain failure. Action for action\u2019s sake often leads to a life of increased imbalance.

Aparajito picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares).\u00a0<\/p> <p>As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu.

This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist\u2019s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties, out of college, and hoping to live as a writer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alongside his professional ambitions, the film charts his romantic awakening, which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events, and his eventual, fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and demonstrating Ray\u2019s ever-more-impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, Apur Sansar is a breathtaking conclusion to this monumental trilogy.

In that time, they\u2019ve exposed us to wonders such as massaging cat ladies, apocalyptic facial exercises, pizza parties in hell, and our immortal party-god, Duane. Nobody could have predicted the cultural, psychological, and illuminating impact EIT! would have on our consciousness, but seeing all their greatest works chronicled in one place reminds us that in the right hands, garbage can be turned into gold! It is time pack up your copies of Jerry Maguire and accept the fact that your life up until this moment has been pointless.
