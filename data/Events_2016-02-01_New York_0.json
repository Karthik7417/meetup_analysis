North Jersey Ramapo Chapter hikes are rated for pace (A, B or C), mileage, and terrain (A, B or C), with \"C\" designating easier hikes and \"A\" more challenging ones. We recommend that new hikers should first try a \"C\" or short \"B\" hike before undertaking a more difficult one; otherwise, you may not fully enjoy the hiking experience. If you have any doubts, please contact the hike leader in advance.<\/p> <p><b><i>Pace Ratings: <\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Fast - 2.5 mph or faster<br\/>B = Moderate - about 2 mph<br\/>C = Easy - 1.5 mph or less<\/p> <p><b><i>Distance:<\/i><\/b>Noted in miles<\/p> <p><b><i>Terrain Ratings:<\/i><\/b><br\/>A = Strenuous, long\/steep climbs and descents,<br\/>possible rock scrambling<br\/>B = Moderate climbs and descents<br\/>C = Generally flat with little elevation change<\/p> <p>For example, a hike rated \u201cB-7-A\u201d is a moderately paced hike of approximately 7 miles with steep climbs and\/or descents and possible rock scrambling.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike, please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness, including ensuring that the hike is appropriate for your level of fitness, that you wear the proper clothing, and bring the proper gear, food and water (see the ADK's recommended <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adk.org\/page.php?pname=hiking-essentials\"><b>Hiking Essentials<\/b><\/a> and guidelines, below).<\/p> <p>Leaders have the right, responsibility and sole discretion to refuse any hiker he\/she deems to be not properly attired, prepared, or otherwise fit to safely complete the hike.<\/p> <p><b>HIKERS' GUIDELINES:<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Risks:<\/b><\/i> As with all physical activities, hiking involves hazards.

Dress in thin layers so that you can adjust the number of layers as required to maintain comfort. In winter carry a wool cap and wool or polypropylene gloves or mitts and a windproof shell. Be prepared for rain. Bring a rain jacket and rain pants, preferably of the type that permits venting body moisture. Wear comfortable, sturdy boots\/shoes. Do not wear cotton garments in winter.<\/p> <p><i> <b>Drink and Food: <\/b><\/i> Adequate hydration is important year round. Drink frequently during the hike.

Jan 1st (Friday)<\/b><\/p> <p>Hey gang,<br\/>The First event of the New Year: \"FREEZE yourself from the past\" (LITERALLY) and plunge into the Atlantic Ocean as we swim with the Polar Bears Club!!<\/p> <p>Ha! If the last couple of days are any indication, we may even enjoy beautiful beach weather! Always wanted to try the Polar Bear Swim, but never had it in you??? NOW IS YOUR CHANCE!<\/p> <p>The annual polar bear swim is a world famous event organized by Brooklyn's Coney Island Polar Bear Club (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.polarbearclub.org<\/a><\/a>). Each New Years Day, they attract hundreds of swimmers and spectators for one of the biggest winter beach parties imaginable. If you love challenges (or you just want a good laugh), come meet us there!\u00a0<br\/>We should get anywhere from 20-30 psycho JOC'ers for this event. With a little luck, we'll be on TV!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Organizer(s):<br\/>Avi Golden (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Moshe Wolcowitz (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>SO WHAT EXACTLY GOES ON?<br\/>We will be meeting on Sunday, January 1, 2016 at 12pm at the Coney Island beach in Brooklyn in front of the Wonder Wheel Ferris wheel on the boardwalk. The polar bear plunge officially begins at 12:45PM, but we are meeting earlier so that we can go as a group to the water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>SO HOW DO I GET THERE?<br\/>It's easy. Just take the subway to the Coney Island Stillwell Ave stop (D, F, N, or Q subway line), and when you leave the subway walk towards the beach (checkout driving and subway direction by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maps.google.com\/\">www.maps.google.com<\/a>)\u00a0if you plan on driving to the following nearby address: Nathans Famous restaurant, 1310 Surf Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11224). At the intersections of Surf &amp; Stillwell Ave, you will follow Stillwell Ave till then end and you will see the boardwalk, and as you walk along it, you'll see the wheel. It's a short walk so don't worry.<\/p> <p>Feel free to use this wall as a forum for ride share. However, keep in mind that given the traffic in the area, arriving by subway is by far the preferred method of travel.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>WHAT SHOULD I BRING?<br\/>If you would like to swim, you'll need to bring lots of warm clothing, a towel, a hat, water shoes, and waterproof bags to store your wet gear. Please note: The sand is going to be cold so be sure to bring water shoes or your feet will freeze.<\/p> <p>WHERE CAN I CHANGE?<br\/>There are changing rooms and restrooms at the beach.<\/p> <p>WHAT'S THE COST?\u00a0<br\/>As we like to say, IT'S FREE TO FREEZE, BABY!<\/p> <p>WHAT IF I DIE OF PNEUMONIA?<br\/>Our club has no money, so a lawsuit is pointless. Ok, seriously, it's a common myth that you can get sick from being cold.\u00a0<br\/>According to the American Lung Association, the flu and colds are only more common in the winter months because that is when the viruses spread across the country. Additionally, the event will have numerous life guards, and we will only be swimming for a few minutes (some people run into the water and run right out) so there is very little risk of hypothermia. In fact, the Coney Island Polar Bear Club cannot recall a single case of anyone ever developing hypothermia, and people have been taking the plunge at Coney Island for over a hundred years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>YEAH, BABY!! SEE YA IN THE OCEAN!!!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Avi &amp; Moshe!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"closest address is 1310 Surf Ave on the Board Walk (near the Ferris wheel)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jewish-Outdoors-Club\/events\/227664034\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":6300000,"name":"JOC Polar Bear Swim!!!","id":"227664034","time":1451667600000,"updated":1451675071000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1380727221000,"name":"The Jewish Outdoors Club","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10521162,"urlname":"Jewish-Outdoors-Club","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"JOCers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"2367 Frederick Douglass Blvd W 127th St","name":"Harlem Bar B Q","lon":-73.950195,"id":23703680,"lat":40.811508,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.74217414856,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450481907000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>$35 Prix Fixe Brunch includes appetizer, entree, and 90 minutes of bottomless brunch cocktails.

The practice will close with pranayama techniques and an 18-minute meditation, to facilitate a connection to universal intelligence and unbound potential.<\/p> <p>Cost: \u00a0$40 in advance; $50 day of workshop<\/p> <p>Sign up with<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ishtayoga.com\/event\/new-years-day-sweat-and-samadhi-soundbath\/\"> Ishtayoga.com<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyorkayurveda\/events\/227331897\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"New Year\u2019s Day Sweat & Samadhi Soundbath","id":"227331897","time":1451674800000,"updated":1451755504000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1333723518000,"name":"The New York Ayurveda Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3618342,"urlname":"newyorkayurveda","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"At your home","name":"Your computer","lon":-73.976567,"id":1410451,"state":"NY","lat":40.764077,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":1.20241546631,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446058398000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join this special free LIVE online event from across the world.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/0\/a\/event_172780202.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>With meditation and visualisation, this powerful 30 minute broadcast features beautiful sounds and music to uplift, energise and inspire<\/b>.<\/p> <p>Experience the benefit of the enhanced collective energy of meditating with other people, whilst being in the comfort of your own home or office.<\/p> <p>Each meditation includes an introduction, followed by a time in which to meditate in whatever way is easy and natural to you.<\/p> <p>You are then guided through a visualisation enabling you to focus on living your ideal life.<\/p> <p>Participating Live:<\/p> <p>The broadcast begins promptly at 2.00pm and finishes at 2.30pm.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawofattractioncentre.com\/join-meditation-101-live\/\">***Please click to join Meditation 101 Live at the scheduled broadcast time ***<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><i>Please note that the meditation and visualisation are pre-recorded to ensure sound quality however participation with other people from across the world is live.<\/i><\/p> <p>Meditation 101 Live works best with the following internet browsers: Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Opera.<\/p> <p><b>If you need any technical help connecting to Meditation 101 Live<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawofattractioncentre.com\/connecting-to-meditation-101-live\/\"><b>please click here<\/b><\/a><b>.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Testimonials:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\"That was absolutely amazing!

The organizer for this Meetup event is John, the Event Host, who is listed on the top of the \"going list\" with a photograph. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Description<\/b>:\u00a0We'll first go past the \"Blue Christmas house,\" where all the outdoor decorations are mostly in blue (not the traditional Christmas colors of red, green, and gold), which honors the divided household-a Christian husband and a Jewish wife. Inside, half of the house is decorated for Christmas; the other half is decorated for Hanukkah.<\/p> <p>We'll\u00a0also see an 800-pound robotic Santa Claus (he sometimes will have a conversation with you!), merry-go-rounds, Nativity scenes, stately trees bejeweled in colorful lights, inflatable figures, enormous wooden soldiers, dancing animals, candy canes, twinkling snowflakes, and much more.<\/p> <p>One interesting house has holiday greetings illuminated in three languages: English, Italian, and Greek.\u00a0On the side of the house,\u00a0a large snowflake design\u00a0periodically lights up as\u00a0a\u00a0Star of David. This house is incredible!<\/p> <p><b>How the Dyker Heights' holiday light tradition\u00a0got started:<\/b><\/p> <p>In the mid-1980s,\u00a0Lucy Spata\u00a0started the tradition of the Christmas Lights. Lucy said, \"when I first moved into the neighborhood, it looked like a funeral parlor during the winter.\" Lucy's neighbors didn't initially welcome\u00a0her \"over-the-top\" holiday lights display. In fact, Lucy said that when one of\u00a0the neighbors complained about the lights and traffic the lights attracted she told them either to join her with holiday decorations or to move out of the neighborhood. However, when another neighbor started to put up the flamboyant holiday lights to match Lucy's lights, this neighborhood tradition\u00a0really took off!<\/p> <p>We'll be <b>finishing\u00a0between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and 7:00 PM<\/b> near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk.

We'll meet in front of the first entrance, which is the entrance for Women's Outerwear and Handbags Departments.<\/p> <p>Before the walk, restrooms are located downstairs in Century 21 Department Store. The restrooms are located downstairs near the Men's Suits Department. After we start the walk, we'll have very limited opportunities for a restroom stop because we'll be walking in mostly\u00a0residential neighborhoods.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation:<\/b>\u00a0Take the southbound \"R\" subway train to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.\u00a0After getting off the train, go to the token booth level and make a left turn upstairs. At street level,\u00a0walk east (on the southern side of 86th Street) for about half of a block to the entrances of Century 21 Department Store.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions: <\/b>This is a one-way walk, so we will not be going back to the starting point. If you want to take your car, you can park your car somewhere near the \"R\" subway train at 86th Street and 4th Avenue. At the end of the walk, you will have to take the northbound \"D\" subway train at 71st Street to\u00a036th Street and\u00a0then take the connecting southbound\u00a0\"R\" subway train back down to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Time:<\/b>\u00a0This one-way walk will <b>finish between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and\u00a07:00 PM<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Place:<\/b>\u00a0We'll be finishing near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue. (The \"D\" subway train is the only subway line that runs in Dyker Heights, and it cuts through only one corner of Dyker Heights at 71st Street.)

If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee).

This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Chapter will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u2014nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our chapter life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.<\/p> <p>Our greatest primary task is to put people to work electing Bernie Sanders. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Chapter itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our resources toward greater and greater outreach efforts.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of conservatives in our Democratic County Committee and, by engaging on an Islandwide scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a progressive use of the Committee for those best fitted for the Committee. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the numbers of Progressives on the County Committee and with this the power to purchase the output of our Party.<\/p> <p><br\/>It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the enduring lack of an SIPDA logo. It can be helped by insistence that our members act forthwith on the demand that a logo be decided upon.<\/p> <p><br\/>It can be helped by the unifying of creative activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by chapter planning for and supervision of a newsletter which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/THESIPDA\/events\/227564872\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"New Year Inauguration of the SIPDA","id":"227564872","time":1451763000000,"updated":1451774535000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435644811000,"name":"Staten Island Progressive Democrats of America","group_lon":-74.0899963379,"id":18708778,"urlname":"THESIPDA","group_lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Progressive Democrats of America"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"7721 3rd Ave","name":"Cappuccino Cafe","lon":-74.028587,"id":23997226,"lat":40.629539,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.58276748657,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451140110000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/I-need-someone-to-talk-to\/events\/227636320\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":9000000,"name":"Push yourself to come in Brooklyn","id":"227636320","time":1451763000000,"updated":1451797825000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1394899023000,"name":"I need someone to talk to.","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":13357542,"urlname":"I-need-someone-to-talk-to","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"7721 3rd Ave","name":"Cappuccino Cafe","lon":-74.028587,"id":23997226,"lat":40.629539,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.58276748657,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451188102000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Discussing-Disability\/events\/227647341\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Let's get together and talk - PUSH YOURSELF TO COME!","id":"227647341","time":1451763000000,"updated":1451774536000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1404152515000,"name":"Discussing Ability","group_lon":-74.0199966431,"id":15418352,"urlname":"Discussing-Disability","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"08840","country":"us","city":"Metuchen","address_1":"215 Durham Avenue","name":"Metuchen Sportsplex","lon":-74.371872,"id":8697892,"state":"NJ","lat":40.542461,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":36,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6755084991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451319690000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey all,<br\/>The only time available was saturday between 3-5 so we are posting this in case there is any interest... not an ideal time I know but we wanted to offer it all the same!<br\/>Details on how to use Google Wallet are:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>** Edit: second court added, first one full in one hour!<\/p> <p>** P.S.

Lucy said, \"when I first moved into the neighborhood, it looked like a funeral parlor during the winter.\" Lucy's neighbors didn't initially welcome\u00a0her \"over-the-top\" holiday lights display. In fact, Lucy said that when one of\u00a0the neighbors complained about the lights and traffic the lights attracted she told them either to join her with holiday decorations or to move out of the neighborhood. However, when another neighbor started to put up the flamboyant holiday lights to match Lucy's lights, this neighborhood tradition\u00a0really took off!<\/p> <p>We'll be <b>finishing\u00a0between<\/b> <b>6:45 PM and 7:00 PM<\/b> near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk.

Skills of communication, boundaries, asking for what you want, and saying \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 with clarity and kindness.<\/p> <p>Cuddle Party is led by trained and certified Cuddle Party Facilitators. The Facilitator\u2019s job is to guide you into those skills gently and easily, in a fun, safe and light hearted way. We welcome you and create an atmosphere of respect, and remain available for questions and support.<\/p> <p>At a Cuddle Party you gain:<br\/>* Clarity and confidence<br\/>* Boundary and communication skills<br\/>* Comfort, support and encouragement<br\/>* The secrets to welcome, relaxed, non-sexual touch<\/p> <p>The skills you learn at Cuddle Party translate into every day life, right from the start. When boundaries and consent are clear, every relationship is easier.<\/p> <p>Where else can you attend a workshop in your pajamas?<\/p> <p><b> Cuddle Party is \u2026 a social event!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We open with a Welcome Circle - about 45 minutes of introductions, rules and a few games to help everyone get comfortable. We teach communication and boundary skills in ways that are lighthearted and fun.<\/p> <p>Then we open up for \u2018free-style\u2019 cuddling. You have plenty of time to relax, chat, share a back rub or other welcome touch, cuddle, have a snack or just hang out.<\/p> <p>You can come to a Cuddle Party to meet new people, to enjoy amazing conversations, to touch, to be touched, to have fun, to practice asking for what you want, to practice saying \u201cno\u201d to what you don\u2019t want \u2014 all in a setting structured to be a safe place for exploration and enjoyment. Shucks, you can even come to a Cuddle Party just to cuddle!<\/p> <p><b>These are the Cuddle Party rules.<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Pajamas (or cuddle-clothes) stay on the whole time.<\/p> <p>2) You don't have to cuddle anyone at a Cuddle Party, ever.<\/p> <p>3) You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone. (Be as specific in your request as you can.)<\/p> <p>4) If you're a yes, say YES. If you're a no, say NO.<\/p> <p>5) If you're a maybe, say NO.<\/p> <p>6) You are encouraged to change your mind anytime you want.<\/p> <p>7) Respect your relationship agreements and communicate with your partner.<\/p> <p>8) Get me of my assistant if you have a questions or concern or need assistance with anything during the Cuddle Party.<\/p> <p>9) Tears and laughter are both welcome.<\/p> <p>10) Respect people's privacy when sharing about Cuddle Parties and do not gossip.<\/p> <p>11) Arrive on time.<\/p> <p>12) Be hygienically savvy.<\/p> <p><b>Want to know more about Cuddle Party?<\/b><\/p> <p>Cuddle Party has been around since February 2004.<\/p> <p><br\/>There is lots of information about Cuddle Parties on the official Cuddle Party website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuddleparty.com\">www.cuddleparty.com<\/a> so if you are curious, be sure to check out the FAQ section and some of the articles too<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/b\/4\/600_443414772.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Be On Time: <\/b>PLEASE arrive on time at 6:00 PM to check-in and change into your Cuddle Clothes so we can start the Welcome Circle by 6:30 PM.<\/p> <p><b>No Late Arrivals:<\/b> Sorry - but after the Welcome Circle begins, no late arrivals can enter<\/p> <p><b>What To Wear: <\/b>Pajamas\/Athletic Wear. \u00a0Think more comfy than sexy.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What To Bring:<\/b> A pillow or stuffed animal if you like.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/227619270\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvcbfb","time":1451829600000,"updated":1451841995000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451314936000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This venue gets crazy crowded later, so we got to get a jump on it.

Lily is a published bikini and lingerie model based out of Boston and has become one of our favorite models to work with over the past year. She gives her all at every shoot and such amazing photos to boot. We are looking forward to this special shoot with Lily Marie as she may be joining a management company soon and we are honored to be one of her last shoots, if not her last shoot as a freelance model. So, If you haven't had the opportunity to work with this beauty, this is a can't miss shoot.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About this Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have planned out three looks with Lily Marie: First look will be a bikini, pinup look. Second look will be a lingerie look with a Victoria Secret style. (We'll be using the LED lights for this one for a more romantic, dramatic style.) The third look will be a Pre-Valentine's inspired implied look with bedsheets. (As per Lily, up to nude implied.)<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup so you know what to expect at the shoot.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>NEW:\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox as that adds the surcharge automatically.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/227625679\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Bikini, Lingerie & Implied Shoot w\/Lily Marie - Jan. 3rd","id":"227625679","time":1451840400000,"updated":1451869227000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Forest Hills","address_1":"103-19 Metropolitan Ave","name":"The Other Place ","lon":-73.849113,"id":24178622,"state":"NY","lat":40.710423,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.88315963745,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451411578000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come have some brunch and knit red hats for newborns born with congenital heart disease.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/227483951\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflyvcbfb","time":1451840400000,"updated":1451852748000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"22 W 46th St","name":"St Pat's Bar and Grill ","lon":-73.980392,"id":24100500,"state":"NY","lat":40.756367,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.669264733791,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451347950000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please read carefully: This event is being sponsored by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksocialnetwork.com\/\">Dave Cervini's New York Social Network\u00a0<\/a>and their partner Meet Up Groups. \u00a0The number of RSVP's listed on your Meet Up reflect only a portion of those actually attending from all the groups participating. \u00a0If you have questions regarding this event contact the host directly at [masked] or call[masked]-2256.<\/p> <p>You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this afternoon of socializing, eating, drinking, games and prizes.\u00a0 We will be on hand from 12:30pm-4pm.

I was hoping to get this scheduled before the new year - however I have a hunch that Dec. will be tight for many - so aiming to ring in the new year with a good book discussion! We are reading Purity by Jonathan Franzen.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Purity-A-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen\/dp\/0374239215\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Purity-A-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen\/dp\/0374239215<\/a><\/p> <p>An Amazon Best Book of September 2015: Purity takes many forms in Franzen\u2019s new novel\u2014to begin with, it is the name of the book\u2019s title character. \u201cPip,\u201d as she is more commonly known, is not fond of her given name, and when we first meet her she is living in a crowded Oakland house under the burden of colossal college debt. Pip soon becomes involved in \u201cThe Sunlight Project,\u201d a WikiLeaks-style group that seeks to uncover secrets and expose them on the web. Run by Andreas Wolf, a charismatic man of renown, who grew up in socialist East Germany, the Sunlight Project becomes the jumping-off point of discovery for Pip, as well as a starting line for Franzen to jump back in time and explore the backgrounds of his primary and secondary characters. There is a point in the book where readers may wonder where this is all headed; but the thoughtfulness and polish of Franzen\u2019s prose should reassure that the journey isn\u2019t in vain. It eventually becomes clear that nearly every character is chasing purity in some form\u2014whether pursuing Pip herself or some platonic ideal\u2014and Franzen ties up the ends in a way that is clean and satisfying but will have you thinking about Purity long after you have finished the book. --Chris Schluep<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Summit-NJ-Book-Club-for-people-who-love-to-read\/events\/227121603\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Discuss our recent read:  Purity by Jonathan Franzen","id":"227121603","time":1451844000000,"updated":1451853054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389879396000,"name":"Summit NJ Book Club: For People Who Love to Read","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":12184042,"urlname":"Summit-NJ-Book-Club-for-people-who-love-to-read","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Book lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450402994000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Friends from 10 other groups will be attending.<\/p> <p>Let's eat some delicious food together at my favorite Dim Sum restaurant.

Each meal begins with a taste of three distinct extra virgin olive oils with the restaurant\u2019s freshly baked Rosemary Olive Oil Fougasse Bread. Guests can gather at the bar and lounge to enjoy tasting dishes and shareable small plates such as the Zucchini Carpaccio and the Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet alongside an assortment of Crostinis, Crudos, Cicchetti &amp; Fritti, imported charcuterie . Main dishes include Riviera Shrimp &amp; Salmon Salad, Octopus a la Gallega, Zucchini Blossom &amp; Goat Cheese Ravioli, Paella del Mar, Mediterranean Branzino, and the FIG &amp; OLIVE Rosemary Lamb Chop. Desserts include Cr\u00e8me Brulee Cheesecake and the Caramelized Apple Tart. The exceptional wine list includes over 30 varietals from the South of France, Italy, and Spain that are offered by the glass, along with full bottles and champagne.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's the link to their Brunch menu:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Here are snippets of reviews about this place:\u00a0<\/p> <p>from Westchester magazine:\u00a0The zucchini carpaccio at the new butter-free (olive oil only) Mediterranean restaurant\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/figandolive.com\/\">Fig &amp; Olive Westchester<\/a>\u00a0(696 White Plains Rd, Scarsdale[masked]) is the perfect starter to any meal: thinly sliced zucchini finished with Picholine olive oil, fresh lemon juice, pine nuts, and Parmesan. Equally delicious is the Proven\u00e7e vegetable and burrata platter of burrata, tomato, balsamic, arugula, black olive, zucchini, and bell pepper served with pesto ricotta dip and basil olive oil. And the list goes on: fig Gorgonzola tartlet; penne with cremini mushroom, Parmesan, black truffle paste, and white truffle olive oil; and the mushroom and truffle soup.<\/p> <p>Another said, \"Very surprised how excellent the service and food quality was. I had previously visited and was not impressed but clearly they have improved tremendously ... Will definitely visit again!\"<\/p> <p><br\/>and one more said, \"Just as delicious as their West Hollywood location. \u00a0My parents were in town and we were too tired to head into the city for dinner but wanted a nice experience. \u00a0This location did not disappoint, interesting olive oils offered with the focaccia bread. \u00a0We had the burrata and shrimp crostinis which were great, burrata was incredibly creamy and fresh. \u00a0I had the penne fungi tartufo, you can't really go wrong with white truffle olive oil. \u00a0My husband's veal was perfectly cooked, my dad was pleased with the sirloin and raved about the carrots, but the best presentation went to my mom's rosemary lamb chops. \u00a0They are uncovered as they come to the table and a wonderful smokey smell billows out. \u00a0You can't really go wrong with any desert option here, the chocolate pot de creme, the warm chocolate souffle and the the green apple sorbet drizzled with olive oil was so refreshing and delicious, great combination.\u00a0I found the service to be very attentive and polite.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/nAr4LtGY7ouFgZKkpjQUVA\/348s.jpghttp:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/yiFN2sUmZDKuHtfX_HcAWA\/168s.jpghttp:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/EuMdq9QP8NF8pxLiwW-Dfw\/168s.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>And lastly, \"I came here on a Sunday for brunch with my husband.\u00a0My hubby has a big appetite so we each ordered a dish AND a side. \u00a0I ordered the truffled scrambled eggs (served with side salad) and a side of the cured salmon. He ordered the salmon poached eggs with a side of the applewood bacon. The side of salmon was HUGE - it could be a meal in itself! It was extremely fresh, as well and was served with a yummy dill cream. My eggs were delicious and served in a skillet atop a wooden cutting board. I thought the cutting board was cute but impractical as my salad greens kept falling off of it onto the table. :-\/<\/p> <p><br\/>They do have a pre-fixe brunch menu but we opted not to do that because the meals we wanted weren't offered AND we didn't want dessert. The coffee here was great, although not super hot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Good meal, beautiful place. We ended up leaving pretty full.

(We will be making SOUNDS together!)\u00a0If you own any instruments\/laptops\/other nose-making devices, please consider bringing them!

A provision to eliminate county-of-origin labels (COOL) for beef and pork labels that consumers rely on in the grocery store\u0094 was tucked into the omnibus government spending bill that Congress passed. The impetus for repealing COOL was the WTO authorizing more than $1 billion in annual trade sanctions against the United States\u0080\u0094 despite the fact that nine in 10 Americans support the commonsense consumer protection. This is just a taste of the trade-pact assaults we'\u0080\u0099ll see on the policies we count on for safe food, a clean environment and so much more if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is enacted.&lt;a&gt; Urge your members of Congress to reject the TPP and its attacks on our laws.&lt;\/a&gt; The TPP includes even more constraints on food safety and rollbacks of environmental standards. And it would permit individual foreign corporations to launch direct attacks on our public interest policies.&lt;a&gt; Even if you'\u0099ve already taken action on this issue, please do so again today now that COOL actually has been repealed under orders from the WTO.&lt;\/a&gt; <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b> Upcoming Events<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Sunday, January 3, 2016, 7:30 PM: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/457884241070998\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\">Webinar: TPP A Beginners' Guide + Training for Trainers<\/a><\/b><br\/>Location: Your phone and computer - register <a href=\"http:\/\/tradejustice.net\/callreg\">here<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Monday, January 4, 2016, 7 PM: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/924734134285033\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\">Building Bridges: TPP Secrets Unveiled wih Melinda St. Louis of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch<\/a><\/b><br\/>Location: 99.5FM or streaming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wbai.org\/playernew.html\">here<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Tuesday, January 5, 2016, 5 PM:<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/809672905845005\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/809672905845005\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\"><b>Flush The TPP Tuesday Vigil in Newton NJ<\/b><\/a><br\/>Location: Town Square Newton, NJ<\/p> <p><b>Wednesday, January 6, 2016, 9 PM: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/179170489102334\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\">National TPP Resistance Call<\/a><\/b><br\/>Location: Your Phone and computer - register <a href=\"http:\/\/myaccount.maestroconference.com\/conference\/register\/G6P276A1T572ZZOC\">here<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Saturday, January 9, 2016, 2 PM: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/781538118640815\/?action_history=null&amp;ref=4\">Help Build our Base Against the TPP!

If so, you\u2019ve come to the right place.<\/p> <p>Here is the path to success with women:<\/p> <p><b>Step 1 is everything that happens before you open your mouth.<\/b><\/p> <p>Most guys think that they look presentable, but truth be told, most guys are clueless of how to present themselves to women. If you don't dress and present the body language of someone she would date, you've got no chance and she'll immediately rule you out.<\/p> <p>We walk around making snap judgements of people all the time. \u00a0You\u2019re sitting in a restaurant scanning the room thinking\u00a0<i>\u201cThere\u2019s an old waitress, fat chick, cute hostess with a nice little tush, sloppy looking dude, short, broke bus boy, rich old guy, etc\u2026\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>You\u2019re not the only one doing the judging, they are judging you too.<\/p> <p>Women have a forcefield that protects them from ineligible suitors and the number one factor the forcefield discriminates against is your appearance.<\/p> <p>You don't have to be good looking, but you must look good.<\/p> <p>If your body language is confident and you know how to dress, you can fake the funk enough to get past the forcefield of most beautiful women.<\/p> <p>But if your fashion sucks and its obvious that you don\u2019t quite fit in, you\u2019ll never even get your foot in the door.<\/p> <p><b>Step 2 is what we call Social Protocol.<\/b><\/p> <p>Social protocol is the established code of procedure or behavior in any group, organization, or social situation. \u00a0If you do not follow social protocol, you will trigger the second layer of someone\u2019s forcefield.<\/p> <p>Your appearance will get you in the door, but the wrong behavior will get you booted right back out.<\/p> <p>Having a mastery of social protocol is something that can take years, even decades to accomplish. \u00a0If you want an example look at successful politicians. \u00a0Successful politicians rarely slip up in social situations and they have the ability to make everyone they meet feel important and like their best friend. \u00a0They are dynamic, interesting, engaging and attentive. In order for a politician to be successful he\/she must win over the majority of people to keep their job.<\/p> <p>Politics isn\u2019t for everyone but in order to attract the right people into your life, you have to understand the level of social protocol in order to fit in. \u00a0Social protocol is made up of many factors: How you engage people, how you say hello, goodbye, where you sit at a table, how you shake someone\u2019s hand, where you wait outside of a club, when you ask a woman for a phone number, when you go for a kiss, how to introduce your friends to each other, how you order a drink, how you split a tab, the list goes on and on and on. \u00a0There is even a recognizable vernacular for different groups of people.<\/p> <p>If you want to follow \"cool people\" social protocol, you have to learn the \"cool people\" vernacular. \u00a0If you want to fit in with a bunch of techie geeks, you have to talk like a techie geek.<\/p> <p>If you still believe there is a quick fix for a guy who doesn\u2019t understand social protocol I hope you can see the flaw in your logic. \u00a0You cannot have a mastery of social protocol over night because you must learn the rules which takes time and exposure.<\/p> <p>The key to really being a master at any skill is to understand the rules so well that you know how to break them.<\/p> <p>Step 3 is to learn to not give a shit and you'll embody \"cool.\"<\/p> <p>Cool is defined as this: marked by steady dispassionate calmness and self-control. \u00a0In other words, someone who doesn't give a shit and knows when and when not to get excited. \u00a0When you learn social protocol and interact with hundreds and hundreds of people in social situations the anxiety and nervousness you once felt will fade away.<\/p> <p>You will no longer fear rejection and thriving in social situations will become second nature to you...<\/p> <p>The key to really being a master at any skill is to understand the rules so well that you know how to break them.<\/p> <p>We will go much further in depth into these topics during the meetup and you'll walk away with a roadmap of how to become a man who is loved by women and envied by other men.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Date-Like-A-Boss-Attract-The-Most-Beautiful-Women-In-NYC\/events\/227577313\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"3 Strategies To Meet Women, Bypass Their \"Forcefields\" & Get In The Money Zone","id":"227577313","time":1451869200000,"updated":1452497416000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1358607870000,"name":"Date Like A Boss - Attract The Most Beautiful Women In NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6735642,"urlname":"Date-Like-A-Boss-Attract-The-Most-Beautiful-Women-In-NYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Bosses"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"240 West 35th St.","name":"Jack Doyle's","lon":-73.991638,"id":14819082,"state":"NY","lat":40.752289,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.18024289608,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451313530000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WOOOHOOO!!!!

To RSVP, please send an email to: LindaEwen at nyc dot rr dot com, with your first and last name. We plan on meeting on the 1st Monday of every month, but occasionally\u00a0there are\u00a0changes. You should receive an email, if there's a change. I suggest you print out any email response you receive, even though it's not required. The Conference Center's security department, requires your\u00a0first and last name, so please include your full name,\u00a0within the body of your email. A photo ID is mandatory. Sometimes, the map on this meetup link above, is incorrect, so please\u00a0write down the address.\u00a0If you don't get\u00a0an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request.It's OK, to be half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient, (no seating limitation). For those who sent their first email request, on the day of the event, this process may take half an hour, and the cut off time for confirmation is 7:00 PM.

With such great insights being generated, it\u2019s truly a shame if they go unheard or misunderstood. In this talk, Matt will discuss the pitfalls of communicating data in a large organization, the best ways to tell a compelling story with data, and the elements of the BI stack that will help you do it. With references to industry giants like Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, and Bret Victor, you can expect to learn how new and old ideas are driving modern storytelling.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Speaker Biography: Matt Monihan is on the product team at RJMetrics, a business intelligence company in Philadelphia. With some exceptionally intelligent people at RJ, he designed one of the world's most advanced chart builders.

Huxley's bold, nontraditional narrative tells the loosely autobiographical story of Anthony Beavis, a cynical libertine Oxford graduate who comes of age in the vacuum left by World War I. Unfulfilled by his life, loves, and adventures, Anthony is persuaded by a charismatic friend to become a Marxist and take up arms with Mexican revolutionaries. But when their disastrous embrace of violence nearly kills them, Anthony is left shattered\u2014and is forced to find an alternative to the moral disillusionment of the modern world.\u00a0<\/p>

There is no obligation, no dependence, and no commitment to a group or believe, just respect.<\/p> <p>During the two-hour sessions, Fredy will share not only information but also his gift as a sound healer, interpreting melodies that he uses to guide the Singing Meditation Ceremonies.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ancestral-Journey\/events\/227214597\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Free Ancestral Journey Information Session","id":"227214597","time":1451952000000,"updated":1451960336000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444128797000,"name":"Ancestral Journey","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":19001016,"urlname":"Ancestral-Journey","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Truth seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1359 1st Avenue New York, NY 10021","name":"Session 73","lon":0,"id":23822393,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438014510000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11666249_10153114853914482_3426453904694375310_n.jpg?oh=9a0cb1ff0706281e8e773340f773f240&amp;oe=561A51EE\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11666249_10153114853914482_3426453904694375310_n.jpg?oh=9a0cb1ff0706281e8e773340f773f240&amp;oe=561A51EE<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Description<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The Salsa Party is back at Session 73.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this.

We hope that by being together, listening to each other, and by sharing our experiences, strength and hope, we will learn to see the value of life in a new context. For the first hour of each meeting members share their experiences. The second half of the meeting is reserved for a guest speaker relating to either the legal or emotional aspects of separation\/divorce. We meet every Monday eveing at the Church in the Highlands, 35 Bryant Ave. White Plains, New York. We are a mixed group of men and women. There are about 50 members, with approximately 20 attendees per meeting. There are no fees, new members are welcome, no reservation is necessary.

My idea is to kick around our problems and experiences, and see if that helps in dealing with the issues. I have changed the location for the meetup: at TGI Fridays 826 New Jersey 3 Clifton.
