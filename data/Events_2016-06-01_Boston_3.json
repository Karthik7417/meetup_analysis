The film is one that should be seen by every person here in America, not just Black people. It is a must-see for its educational qualities, its unbowed stance against racism, and unapologetic manner of speaking truth to power.<\/p> <p>The film will examine the untold history of African people, the African cultural contribution to the nation of the world, and the events that have contributed to the condition of African people today. Viewers will learn about the Nubian\/Kushitic origins of Nile Valley Civilization, contact between Africa and the Americas since the times of antiquity, as well as the influence of the Moors in Europe leading to Europe\u2019s intellectual Renaissance.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/230859725\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"xfbvslyvhbfc","time":1464044400000,"updated":1464057051000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Ashland","address_1":"27 Tri St","name":"The Tipi","lon":-71.428436,"id":24377840,"state":"MA","lat":42.244778,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":20.0129356384,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455914059000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Why join a men's circle?

Through the practice of meditation, we can look at challenging circumstances in our life, re-adjust our perspective on the situation and practice cultivating an attitude that allows our mind to stay balanced and solution-oriented. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditationinmass.org\/somerville\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meditationinmass.org\/somerville\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Serlingpa-Buddhist-Meditation-Center-JP\/events\/230900498\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Somerville - Transforming Problems Into Opportunities","id":"230900498","time":1464044400000,"updated":1464051200000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1287332784000,"name":"Meditation in Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1723620,"urlname":"Serlingpa-Buddhist-Meditation-Center-JP","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Practitioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01923","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Peabody","address_1":"@ The North Shore Mall","name":"Barnes and Noble Cafe","lon":-70.940804,"id":8418972,"state":"MA","lat":42.541786,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":14.2112503052,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459358618000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>May's Book is:<\/p> <p>The Kitchen House by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3067074.Kathleen_Grissom\">Kathleen Grissom<\/a> (Goodreads Author) The Kitchen House 4.16 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6837103-the-kitchen-house#\"> Rating Details<\/a> \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6837103-the-kitchen-house#other_reviews\">142,626 Ratings <\/a> \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6837103-the-kitchen-house#other_reviews\">13,350 Reviews <\/a>When a white servant girl violates the order of plantation society, she unleashes a tragedy that exposes the worst and best in the people she has come to call her family.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/231204187\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvhbfc","time":1464046200000,"updated":1464115575000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"44 Fifth Street","name":"Moves & Vibes Dance Studio","lon":-71.188751,"id":19335432,"state":"MA","lat":42.184925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5623426437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449460888000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>April 25th, Moves &amp; Vibes Dance Co starting a 8-week advance beginner Zouk beginners course.

Anything that can be donated will be thankfully welcomed.<\/p> <p>\n\nIf a \"handyman\" is not able to donate monetarily, but could donate his time and talent for repairing and cleaning up an old house, she would be most appreciative.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nA Lynn Public Schools veteran teacher of 30 years has been diagnosed with a terminal cancer and needs surgery on her brain in May, 2016. # Thank A Teacher<\/p> <p><br\/>Patricia (Hart) Tierney is a retired Lynn Public Schools elementary teacher and life-long resident of Lynn. She taught both regular classrooms, then became a music specialist for the last 24 years of her career. She touched the lives of thousands of underprivileged children by sharing her love and enthusiasm for music. Outside of the classroom, Tricia enjoys traveling and teaching water aerobics at many local fitness centers.<\/p> <p><br\/>In July of 2015 a tumor was found in each of her lungs. They were biopsied and found to be malignant metastasized transitional cell carcinoma from the urothelial cancer in her bladder. This was her seventh cancer in the past four years, and it is terminal. She was being treated with chemotherapy. She was getting other symptoms of concern as blurry vision, only seeing half of her cell phone screen, and brain bleeds seen on CAT scans and MRI\u2019s. She went for neurological tests in April, 2016 and the neurologist found missing connections from the arteries to the veins on the left side of her brain. This is what was causing the symptoms for her. She has an AV Dural Fistula. The misconnections have formed on the hard matter that covers the brain to make things worse. Surgery is on 5\/24\/2016.<\/p> <p><br\/>Tricia considered herself very lucky to still be teaching water aerobics at the Burbank YMCA in Reading; the Torigian YMCA in Peabody; the Ipswich Family YMCA; and the Beverly Athletic Club. She also was the director of a nursery for toddlers at the Melrose Unitarian Universalist Church. Tricia\u2019s oncologist requested that she resign all jobs in February, 2016 as her tumors had grown on her previous chemo medication. Reluctantly, she did. She now has no weekly income. The funds will be used immediately and continuously to replace her salary to take care of daily living needs. Please help by donating if you are able, then sharing this campaign with your friends and contacts.<\/p> <p><br\/>Let\u2019s rock this fund and help Tricia become one of the everyday MIRACLES. Let the Lord be in the surgeon\u2019s hands during surgery and put an end to the bleeding on the left side of her brain. Tricia has way too much living to do with uplifting people who know how to have a good time. Let\u2019s put an end to five years of sickness and say hello again to joy, excitement, and LIFE!<\/p> <p>\n\nThank you for your time and compassion.<\/p> <p><br\/>Be safe, yours truly Eirini Kay<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/22gjj7w","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/231226287\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Tricia Tierney a member of NSS needs our help well she fights for her life","id":"rphmtlyvhbfc","time":1464091200000,"updated":1464176523000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"815 Boylston Street","name":"Apple Store","lon":-71.082367,"id":9583122,"state":"MA","lat":42.34882,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.999883294106,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463420327000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us at Apple Store, Boylston Street, for an exclusive FileMaker event showcasing the new FileMaker 15 Platform.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/230698297\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":10800000,"name":"Open Cards and Board Game Night in Medford","id":"230698297","time":1464127200000,"updated":1464261428000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"303 Congress St. #701","name":"OpenView Venture Partners","lon":-71.050598,"id":24511768,"state":"MA","lat":42.351227,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":75,"headcount":0,"distance":1.16356861591,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1461694031000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>BGN Fans, \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We're excited to bring you May's Board Game Night, as always hosted by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/eastcoastproduct.com\/\">East Coast Product<\/a>,\u00a0and this month sponsored by <a href=\"http:\/\/openviewpartners.com\">OpenView<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/downeastcider.com\">Downeast Cider House<\/a><\/p> <p>Your $5 registration includes drinks and snacks.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

Anyone who's built a Docker image before, will know how complex the workflow can get. From how to support multi-tenancy builds, keeping attack surfaces small when creating compile time libraries, to finding solutions for how to expose SSH keys without leaving traces in the image, our own development team at Cloud 66 shared many of these challenges.<\/p> <p>To solve this problem, we built Habitus on AWS as an open source build flow tool for Docker. During this talk Khash will introduce you to Habitus, explain how it enables developers to combine multiple Dockerfiles into complex build and deployment workflows, and how you can deploy Docker in production with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloud66.com\/?utm_source=meetup&amp;utm_medium=aws&amp;utm_campaign=boston\">Cloud 66<\/a> and AWS.<\/p> <p><i>About Khash Sajadi: <\/i><br\/>Khash is founder and CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloud66.com\/?utm_source=meetup&amp;utm_medium=aws&amp;utm_campaign=boston\">Cloud 66<\/a> that provides a DevOps as a service for Rails and for Docker on any cloud provider.

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/231168419\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"The Tuesday Track Workout","id":"bdcdmlyvhbgc","time":1464129000000,"updated":1464141745000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center","name":"Microsoft","lon":-71.08535,"id":15594572,"state":"MA","lat":42.362583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.805574893951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463229373000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this <b>introductory <\/b>session you will learn how to create simple stream processing solution with Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) that <b>collect, analyze and visualize<\/b> \u00a0<b>data <\/b>from <b>IoT <\/b>devices in<b> real-time<\/b>.

I have permission for us to do a series of Beginner Salsa Lessons. (swing lessons to follow if this is a success) I'll post 2 to start so please help me make these a success by giving it a shot. You'll have a blast trust me!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our instructors<\/b> have years of dancing experience, plenty of personality and of course I'll be providing the sound system with some great music. I've taken group lessons before and the music was too fast, esp in the open dance time. So we're going to gear this to 2 left footed neanderthal dancers like me.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Hanson Rec Commission members are very excited about this and want us to succeed. So thank them when you see them at the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our plan is to have weekly dances for 2 hours. The first hour will be a lesson and the 2nd an open dance. These will be geared for beginners so don't be afraid. To You Salsa veterans - please come because we'll need your help too... and you can show off during the open dance hour.<\/p> <p><br\/>Once per month we'll be having a bartender for a 4 hour dance. A little wine might loosen up the hips a little ;-) This first dance will be for 2 hours. The 2nd dance lesson on Feb 26th will have the bar and be open for 4 hours.

Both records soon propelled her onto a European tour and by 2008 Pyeng had developed the song cycle for her third release \u201cPortholes To a Love &amp; Other Short Stories,\u201d which earned her a Fellowship in music composition through New York Foundation For The Arts. Her latest project explores the inner and outer contradictions of African American ancestry, adornment and hair.<\/p> <p>Celia Slattery's original music weaves elements of jazz, pop and folk\/rock with perceptive lyrics inspired by artists like Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen. She also covers everyone from Ella to Adele, giving context to the music through humor and stories. Celia released her third CD last year, Our Life Together, a \u201cwonderfully crafted album that\u2019s highlighted by soul-stirring performances both musically and vocally.\u201d (Metronome Magazine)<\/p> <p>Mark Shilansky is a multi-talented instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, arranger and producer. Jon Garelick of the Boston Globe called his most recent release, Fugue Mill, \u201can especially fresh and inventive jazz album.\u201d Mark is in demand as an accompanist for singers including grammy award-winning Luciana Souza, Rebecca Parris, and Kim Nazarian (New York Voices). Celia and Mark have been friends and collaborators for almost twenty years, and Mark produced and played on two of Celia\u2019s CDs.<\/p> <p>Singers are invited to bring their music and sit in with the band!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonLiveMusic\/events\/231016958\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Celia Slattery and Singers Showcase at Ryles","id":"231016958","time":1464136200000,"updated":1464147780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1173143620000,"name":"Boston Live Music","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":444171,"urlname":"BostonLiveMusic","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Fans of Live Music"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Danvers","address_1":"150R ANDOVER St","name":"Danvers Indoor Sports","lon":-70.971596,"id":23829904,"lat":42.558483,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":14.632109642,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451377303000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0======== \u00a0WE PLAY ON FIELD 1 ========<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Please be at Danvers Indoor Sports by 8:45 PM so we can start playing exactly at 9 PM.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Bring a white and dark color T-shirts so we can be divided evenly into two teams.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0The cost of each player, varies depending on how many players will attend the game, so if we are:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a014 player, will cost \u00a0$10 per player<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a013 player, will cost \u00a0$11 per player<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a012 player, will cost \u00a0$12 per player<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a011 player, will cost \u00a0$13 per player<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a010 player, will cost \u00a0$14 per player<\/b><\/p> <p><b>There will be group (meetup) membership fee of $1 for each player to be collected every month.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>See You in the Field \u00a0Number 1 adjacent to the gym\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Danvers-Real-Indoor-Soccer\/events\/228018748\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":4500000,"name":"Danvers Real Indoor Soccer","id":"jjmfnlyvhbgc","time":1464137100000,"updated":1464143553000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1445469287000,"name":"Danvers, Real Indoor Soccer","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":19049459,"urlname":"Danvers-Real-Indoor-Soccer","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"soccer players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Watertown","address_1":"32 Bigelow Avenue","name":"Armenian Memorial Church (red brick building)","lon":-71.157463,"id":24319486,"state":"MA","lat":42.370094,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.52864599228,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460386770000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Visitors may attend our next two meetings for free and can see what BNI is all about.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/229681412\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":6300000,"name":"Wednesday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"vlfkdlyvhbhc","time":1464192900000,"updated":1464200700000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01824","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chelmsford","address_1":"25 Boston Rd","lon":-71.351454,"phone":" (978) 256-5521","name":"Chelmsford Public Library","id":804251,"state":"MA","lat":42.593829,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.6481800079,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463855292000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Identify and resolve project issues.

The House of the Seven Gables has been one for four centuries. Even more important to maritime safety, America\u2019s lighthouses have kept countless ships from wrecking, saved untold lives, and contributed mightily to the growth and prosperity of the nation. Eric Jay Dolin, the author of Leviathan: The History of Whaling in America, will share the dramatic story of these soaring coastal sentinels, using numerous slides to illuminate the beauty and grandeur of America\u2019s lighthouses. It is a riveting tale of nasty political battles, technological innovation, natural disasters, and war. But most of all it is a story about the male and female keepers, who, often with the invaluable assistance of their families, faithfully kept the lights shining and the fog signals blaring. A book signing for Brilliant Beacons will follow the talk.<\/p> <p><b>Eric Jay Dolin<\/b> is the author of <i>Leviathan: The History of Whaling In America<\/i>, which was chosen as one of the best nonfiction books of 2007 by The Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe, and also won the 2007 John Lyman Award for U.

Maritime History; and <i>Fur, Fortune, and Empire: The Epic History<\/i> <i>of the Fur Trade in America<\/i>, which was chosen by The Seattle Times as one of the best nonfiction books of 2010, and also won the James P. Hanlan Book Award, given by the New England Historical Association. He is also the author of When America First Met China: An Exotic History of Tea, Drugs, and Money <i>in the Age of Sail<\/i>, which was chosen by Kirkus Reviews as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of 2012.

With no clear direction in her life, the quirky and creative 26-year-old goes from one job to the next in order to help her tight-knit family make ends meet. Her normally cheery outlook is put to the test, however, when she faces her newest career challenge. Taking a job at the local castle, she becomes caregiver and companion to Will Traynor (Claflin), a wealthy young banker who became wheelchair bound in an accident two years prior, and whose whole world changed dramatically in the blink of an eye. No longer the adventurous soul he once was, the now cynical Will has all but given up. That is until Lou determines to show him that life is worth living. Embarking together on a series of adventures, both Lou and Will get more than they bargained for, and find their lives\u2014and hearts\u2014changing in ways neither one could have imagined.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/z3c5iIYUviI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/z3c5iIYUviI<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/231272715\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Me Before You      5-25  Wed.

The House of the Seven Gables has been one for four centuries. Even more important to maritime safety, America's lighthouses have kept countless ships from wrecking, saved untold lives, and contributed mightily to the growth and prosperity of the nation. Eric Jay Dolin, the author of Leviathan: The History of Whaling in America, will share the dramatic story of these soaring coastal sentinels, using numerous slides to illuminate the beauty and grandeur of America's lighthouses. It is a riveting tale of nasty political battles, technological innovation, natural disasters, and war. But most of all it is a story about the male and female keepers, who, often with the invaluable assistance of their families, faithfully kept the lights shining and the fog signals blaring. A book signing for Brilliant Beacons will follow the talk. Eric Jay Dolin is the author of Leviathan: The History of Whaling In America, which was chosen as one of the best nonfiction books of 2007 by The Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe, and also won the 2007 John Lyman Award for U. S. Maritime History; and Fur, Fortune, and Empire: The Epic History of the Fur Trade in America, which was chosen by The Seattle Times as one of the best nonfiction books of 2010, and also won the James P. Hanlan Book Award, given by the New England Historical Association. He is also the author of When America First Met China: An Exotic History of Tea, Drugs, and Money in the Age of Sail, which was chosen by Kirkus Reviews as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of 2012. A graduate of Brown, Yale, and MIT, where he received his Ph.D. in environmental policy, Dolin lives in Marblehead, Massachusetts, with his family.

Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MTGBoston\/events\/230373894\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Wednesday Magic In Medford","id":"230373894","time":1464215400000,"updated":1464268249000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331418092000,"name":"MTG Boston","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":3454302,"urlname":"MTGBoston","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Planeswalkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02111","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"17 Beach St","lon":-71.062076,"phone":"(617) 423-3934","name":"Pho Hoa","id":745776,"state":"MA","lat":42.35148,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.715769469738,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458857523000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/0\/e\/b\/600_448177099.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>The book is The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie.<\/b><\/p> <p>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation.

We do have a 30-second \u201cRound Robin\u201d that everyone participates in (it\u2019s fun and easy), and you\u2019ll probably be asked to introduce yourself [talk very briefly about an interest, or what brought you there]. Pretty basic, no surprises.\u00a0 The only requirement is to enjoy yourself and get a sense of how the meet-ups run. [They start promptly at 6:50, so please arrive by or before 6:45. They end by 8:30 pm.]<\/p> <p><b>We're planning another special meetup Wednesday, June 8, with verbal branding expert Stephen Melanson.<\/b><\/p> <p>Let's face it: crafting an elevator speech - a clear, brief message that creates interest in a project, idea or in yourself (who you are, and what you're looking for) - is one tough assignment. Which explains why most of us avoid developing one. They're typically about 30 seconds, which approximates a typical attention span. Or does it?<\/p> <p>Finally, here's a reason to throw away your elevator pitch (if you even have one).<\/p> <p>Melanson believes they're too long, they provide description [vs position against the competition], and it's not a strategy to continue thru the rest of the conversation. \u201cBranding books don\u2019t recognize that the most important branding moments are conversations,\u201d\u00a0 he explains.<\/p> <p>What's the answer?\u00a0 Great verbal branding is direct, honest, and moves action. We'll learn how to intrigue our listener instead of losing their attention. Ever have that sinking feeling of watching your words fly past him\/her?<\/p> <p>Stephen Melanson is an entertaining and dynamic speaker. We'll start working on our personal branding statements in the previous meetup (May 25), and refine and revise them with Melanson at the special June 8 session.\u00a0 The lessons you learn will stick with you for a long time to come.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 ........................<\/b><\/p> <p>Mark Your Calendar - Our Next Meet-Ups:<\/p> <p>Wed, June 8 (6:45 PM)<\/p> <p>[Next \"Second Saturday\" AM session June 11.]<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<b> ..............................<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>3rd Floor, Room 097.<\/b><\/p> <p>You must take the elevator by the security desk to access the floor.<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b> If you can't find street parking (Beware - Metered until 8 PM !), There is parking to the rear of the bldg.

All are welcome to join us, regardless of experience level!<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have a game you are particularly interested in playing, you are welcome and encouraged to bring it. But this is not required; many people typically bring a selection of their favorites and we're always happy to teach. The only things you need to bring are an open mind and a good attitude. If you're particularly hot to try something out, you are encouraged to leave a comment and see if you can drum up some interest beforehand. Please bear in mind that table space is limited, so an especially huge or epic game may not be appropriate for the venue (but see our Sunday night event at Pandemonium in Central Square for an alternative venue).<\/p> <p><br\/>The event officially opens at 7 PM, but some people like to show up early; those who show up early should feel free to get started on a shorter warm-up game if time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/>We look forward to seeing you at the gaming table!<\/p> <p><br\/>WHERE WE SIT: Unless the restaurant is super-crowded, we gather in the basement dining area; just look for the games and say hi. We're friendly, honest!<\/p> <p><br\/>GETTING THERE:<\/p> <p><br\/>The Panera is located within easy walking distance of the Red Line T and several bus lines, and public transit is probably the easiest way of getting there. If you drive, mall parking is (theoretically) limited to 2 hours except where posted. I've never heard of anyone getting towed for overstaying this limit. For the extra-cautious, there are metered spots on Mass Ave; check the meter to be sure but most Cambridge meters don't need to be fed after 6 PM or 7 PM. There is also a Hubway bike-share station less than five minute's walk from the mall.<\/p> <p><br\/>SOME NOTES:<\/p> <p><br\/>As a group, we don't usually make a huge deal about attendance policy, however: attendance at these events is limited, and our Panera events are usually not huge; one side effect of this is that RSVPing and then not showing up can have a disruptive effect on our events, and for particularly popular events, \"no shows\" take up a spot from someone who wanted to be there. Bottom line: If you RSVP for a Panera event, please make a good-faith effort to show up or at least let us know if you can't make it.<\/p> <p><br\/>As far as possible, please also let us know if you're going to be more than a few minutes late. As a rule of thumb, if we haven't heard from you and you arrive after 7:15 or so, you're likely to be limited to a spot at whatever game has room for an extra player. Much later than that, and we'll almost certainly be underway without you! You're welcome to show up and socialize and of course we'll try to accomodate you if we can, but we can't guarantee you a game. Because we as a group tend to play longer and more involved games, most groups at our events tend to play one and only one game per night.<\/p> <p><br\/>Panera has been quite gracious about hosting our group with minimal fuss. To ensure that this happy state of affairs continues, please give them some business if you're hungry or thirsty and (especially) respect the hardworking people who work there, and their desire to go home after a long shift -- be ready to leave when the restaurant closes at ten.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/230917704\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Wednesday Gaming In Porter Square","id":"rgfbqlyvhbhc","time":1464217200000,"updated":1464228835000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Mt Auburn St","name":"Democracy Center","lon":-71.116272,"id":10532532,"state":"MA","lat":42.371239,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.49176168442,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448488423000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a free meditation session, and an introduction to the Art of Living course, meant to bring people together for a few moments of perfect tranquility in the heart of Cambridge.

She was raised in the Essex County in Massachusetts, and was born into a family of musicians. With her parent's being a classical pianist and a classical trumpet-player, and her Aunt being a professional violinist in New York City, Emily also chose to play the violin at the age of five. She started with the Suzuki method and moved onto a more vigorous path of studying viola at New England Conservatory Preparatory School from 2002 - 2006. There she studied with Gillian Rogel in her final year, and was in Benjamin Zander's Youth Philharmonic Orchestra for her last two. (Some of her other accomplishments during this time: In 2005, Emily received first chair in Massachusetts All-States Orchestra, and also went on a 3 week-long tour of Brazil and Venezuela in 2005 with NEC's YPO.) Emily studied classical viola for one final year in from[masked] with New England Conservatory's James Buswell.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/3\/0\/600_449590544.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After a life-evaluation at the age of 18, Emily decided to step away from music and two years later, entered the corporate-world in an administrative role. Her final two and-a-half years were served as the Administrative Assistant to the SVP of Product at Sperry, a men's &amp; women's footwear brand. Another life evaluation was due after year five in the corporate-gig, which is when Emily decided to return to music, newly inspired by the folk and bluegrass scene. After receiving a scholarship to Berklee College of Music and shortly after becoming a full-time student again, she realized that not only was performing in her future, but so was serving her community, and that would be through the channel of music therapy. Now, Emily is in her fifth semester at Berklee College of Music, dual-majoring in Music Therapy &amp; Violin Performance with a Minor in American Roots Studies. There, she is studying with famous performers like Darol Anger, Bruce Molsky, Matt Glaser, Joe Walsh, Dr. David Wallace, Dave Hollander, Tony Trischka, and Casey Driessen. Emily has performed at an array of different venues, ranging from halls such as New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall and Boston's infamous Symphony Hall, to venues like the Cantab Lounge &amp; Club Passim in Cambridge, MA, and The Red Room in Boston. Emily's expected graduation date is May 2017 and hopes to receive her MT-BC license later that year.<\/p> <p><br\/>As with all of notloB's 4th Wednesday concerts at the Armory, admission is free, donation ($5-10pp) is appreciated.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily! You decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in many different styles. Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, dancers \u00a0hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together. \u00a0(This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better. \u00a0Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The talk doesn't have to be technical and the only requirement is that others should be able to learn something from it!<\/p> <p><br\/>Following the lightning talks, we'll go back to regular hack night programming. Bring any projects you're working on or homework you have to do. Work on a code challenge from one of the many code challenge websites (codeeval, exercism.io, hackerank, etc.). Write a blog post, or just catch up on work or emails.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The tentative schedule is as follows:\u00a0<\/p> <p>6 - 6.30pm: Registration + Mingle<br\/>6.30 - 7.15pm: Lightning Talks<br\/>7.15 - 9pm: Hacking<\/p> <p>We already have women signed up to talk (lineup to be posted later), but if you want to be on the waitlist to talk at our next event please email us at [masked] with the subject \u201cLightning Talks\u201d.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you'd like to speak but don't have a topic in mind, let us know and we can help you brainstorm.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The Work is a way of identifying and questioning the thoughts that cause all the suffering in the world. As Katie guides you with her humor and lovingly incisive clarity, you will find that your stressful beliefs begin to radically shift.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=x4_iejhT6AA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=x4_iejhT6AA<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Work<\/b><\/p> <p>The Work helps us to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause us suffering.\u00a0 Inquiry consists of four simple questions and a \"turnaround\". \u00a0A turnaround is a way to experience the opposite of the belief that gives us pain. \u00a0Through doing\u00a0The Work, we question thoughts that we have believed for years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Work\u00a0is a simple, deep process which can transform our lives in unimaginable ways. \u00a0We may experience increased clarity, peace, and energy, richer, deeper relationships, and less anger and stress.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DwHujZI4aGQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DwHujZI4aGQ<\/a><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Why Join PGN at Omega for Byron Katie?<\/b><\/p> <p>Spend this Spring exploring which parts of Byron Katie's work is most applicable to you.<\/p> <p>Experience the freedom of undoing whatever makes you unhappy, and allow your mind to return to its true, awakened, peaceful, creative nature.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sBCi7qeFkhw\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sBCi7qeFkhw<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Reading: The Work<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/thework.com\/sites\/thework\/downloads\/little_book\/English_LB.pdf\">PDF of short version of The Work<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Judge Your Neighbor Worksheet<\/b><\/p> <p>Fill out a\u00a0<i>Judge Your Neighbor<\/i>\u00a0Worksheet and then taking the stressful thoughts to Inquiry. \u00a0 You can start the process right now.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thework.com\/downloads\/worksheets\/JudgeYourNeighbor_Worksheet.pdf\">Click here<\/a>\u00a0to print out your own Judge Your Neighbor worksheet to try out before you come.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vqjj7nvqczo&amp;feature=player_embedded\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vqjj7nvqczo&amp;feature=player_embedded<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/228288387\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":248400000,"name":"Byron Katie: Loving What Is","id":"228288387","time":1464379200000,"updated":1464660121000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1362582942000,"name":"Personal Growth Network","group_lon":-71.1900024414,"id":7491122,"urlname":"Personal-Growth-Network","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Lives Well-Lived"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.65042686462,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1464364058000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will start with <a href=\"http:\/\/divineoffice.org\/ord-w04-fri-ep\/?date=20160527\">Evening Prayer<\/a>\u00a0and then decide whether or not we go directly into the El Savador Restaurant or first attend one of the other many many great Latino Food Establishments (well over a dozen!) in the area ranging from Sullivan Square through East Somerville to where we are meeting.<\/p> <p>The prices are very very reasonable for the food and it is a great occasion to celebrate Pentecost Sunday.<\/p> <p><b>This Memorial Day Catholics rightly honor our heroes and remember our Church, who has defended the dignity and freedom of the human person for two-thousand years<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Other than for the food, <i>THIS IS A FREE EVENT!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Call 781-C-FRIARS for more information directions T connections, etc.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Monastic-Cooking-Club\/events\/231447393\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"CELEBRATE Memorial Day Weekend starting w\/ Evening Prayer & great Latino Foods!!","id":"231447393","time":1464381900000,"updated":1464629765000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369842109000,"name":"Monastic Cooking Club","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":8693452,"urlname":"Monastic-Cooking-Club","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Cooks and Servants"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"200 Stuart St","name":"The Revere Hotel","lon":-71.067955,"id":21111482,"state":"MA","lat":42.350636,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.656688868999,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459118620000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The work week has ended and you just wanna relax, well lets all head to the rooftop.

The farmhouse in Westford that is now the ice cream stand began as a dairy barn in 1908. At that time the Kimball family sold milk wholesale. In 1934 John (Jack) Allen Kimball and his wife Clara considered processing the milk and selling it house to house. This idea never came to be. As fate would have it, around this same time, two salesmen stopped by. One was selling his freezer cabinets, the other his ice cream mix. They suggested the Kimballs make ice cream. Jack and Clara took a leap of faith and in 1939 turned the woodshed on the end of the house into an ice cream parlor.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/kimballfarm.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/history2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Over the years, Kimball Farm ice cream became more popular and the family made a name for themselves. Jack eventually decided to eliminate the dairy aspect of the farm and in order to focus on ice cream. In 1975, Jack and Clara moved the ice cream operation into the barn where it remains today,<br\/>becoming the first location of the famous Kimball Farm Ice Cream. Jack ran the business and his three children worked in the ice cream stand. The original flavors included maple walnut, frozen pudding and peppermint stick. In the beginning, a quart of ice cream sold for seventy cents, a cone for five cents and banana splits for twenty-five cents.<\/p> <p>In 1988, the business was passed down to Jack\u2019s grandsons, Michael and Peter Kimball, who run the business today. Since taking charge, they have expanded the business, adding three more locations. In 1989 Kimball Farm added an ice cream stand in Carlisle, MA. Following this came a driving range, nine hole pitch &amp; putt golf course, adventure style mini-golf &amp; a 6000 sq. ft. bumper boat pond along with an outdoor luncheon grill &amp; seafood shack, all at the original Westford, MA, location.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/kimballfarm.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/history3.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>In 1995, the family acquired a new site in Jaffrey, NH. The restaurant, ice cream stand and country store are popular with visitors from near and far. Kimball Farm in Jaffrey is on the site of Silver Ranch and receives deliveries of fresh ice cream several times a week.<\/p> <p>In 2010 the Olde Sawmill Arcade and Grand Slam Batting cages were added to the Westford location; at the same time, the family opened the latest Kimball Farm location in Lancaster, MA featuring the same great ice cream, Outdoor Grill &amp; Seafood Shack and Country Store.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/3\/0\/600_447173552.jpeg\" \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/3\/5\/600_447173557.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/229066964\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Kimball Farm Opening Dayz - Mini golf & Bumper boats - Westford","id":"229066964","time":1464388200000,"updated":1464695933000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":8,"distance":1.68380987644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1464295662000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0No-Limit Hold Em only<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Buy-in will be $20 minimum, $50 maximum<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Rebuys are allowed<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Blinds are .25\/.50<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I'll be dealer<\/p> <p>\n\n\nObservers are welcome to sit at the table and not play.<\/p> <p>I will have snacks and drinks, but feel free to bring food\/drinks\/beer.<\/p> <p>Please arrive between 6:30-6:45pm. \u00a0Cards fly at 6:45.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Women-Poker-Players-of-New-England\/events\/231428077\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Friday night Poker Chicks","id":"231428077","time":1464388200000,"updated":1464405536000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1434037143000,"name":"Women Poker Players of New England","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18665667,"urlname":"Women-Poker-Players-of-New-England","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Poker Chicks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":5,"distance":1.02276945114,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462842497000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>What is Folk Psychology? \u00a0(or What is it like to be Human?)<\/b><\/p> <p>Folk psychology, as philosophers have come to use the phrase, is almost identical with common sense psychology \u2013 the psychology all of us (friend, citizen, salesman, lawyer, politician) employ in our everyday life.<\/p> <p>Folk psychology refers to a social fact of which we are well aware: We understand how other people think well enough to predict and explain their behavior.

This is meant to be both about getting to know parts of the city better, as well as being a photography challenge, because these are unglamorous targets compared to, say, the Zakim bridge, which forces you to find opportunities to portrait the neighborhoods and architecture in a compelling way. Use this as an opportunity to create a project for yourself (Boston brownstone entry stairs? Night street photography?)<\/p> <p>The paradigm for these meetups is to provide you with basic information and some images about the neighborhood, meet as a group to briefly discuss the opportunities, but then spread out to investigate the area, rather than moving in a group. If you do not feel comfortable walking on your own, make sure to tag along with someone in groups of 2-3. Take<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/230346452\/\"> a look at our last neighborhoods meetup <\/a>to get an idea of what one can find.<\/p> <p>Our neighborhood for this evening is Beacon Hill, which has several very nice, tiny cobble stone roads, lots of old and interesting architecture, backyard stairways and loads of intriguing windows, doorways, nooks and crannies.<\/p> <p>At the east edge of Beacon Hill is the MA state house, an often photographed building with its golden dome: try to make it look more interesting than the average tourist snapshot.

Bring water, hiking boots (not sneakers), bug spray and lunch\/snacks. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.<\/p> <p>No dogs and no guests are allowed on hikes. Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.<\/p> <p>Your Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults. The people who have the best times on these hikes are those who stay loose and roll with things as they happen. If you are expecting Daniel Boone as your leader, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree (woof!). If you need everything to run perfectly, this hike is not for you.<\/p> <p>By clicking the \"Yes\" option on the RSVP link you are agreeing to the Liability Waiver as stated below:<\/p> <p>Remember: Your Event Organizers are volunteers.

For example, if you scored 5 points and your opponent scored 3, you will add 2 points to your overall score and your team will throw first in the next round. If you scored 6 points and your opponent scored 6 as well, there will be no points awarded and whoever threw first in the last round will throw first again.

Ok so now that you have taken thousands of photos, time to decide which to keep and which to delete. Part of becoming a better photographer is learning how to <b>SEE<\/b> the difference in photos that are good and those that are great. In this first session we will focus on images from nature.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Join us to discover a simple step by step system for critiquing your photos and taking them from like to love.<\/p> <p>About your instructor: Suzanne Merritt\u00a0\u00a0is a master level photography instructor with a studio at the Boston Center for the Arts. She has been leading workshops on the topics of creativity, photography and beauty in Asia, Europe and the US for over 20 years. Suzanne was the founder of the Polaroid Creativity Lab and has recently launched the <b>Curious Soul Photo School.<\/b>\u00a0She has a masters degree in Aesthetic Education. You can see her photography and subscribe to her blog at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.curioussoulphotos.com\/\">www.curioussoulphotos.com<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/f\/1\/600_449625809.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I loved this one immediately. A keeper for sure.<\/p> <p>Why do we like some photos and <b>LOVE<\/b> others? \u00a0Some just have that special ELUSIVE quality that is difficult to put into words but we know it when we see it. We feel an immediate connection to the image and sense it is good one. We immediately put a heart or star next to those since it is love at first sight.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, most of us are also pretty good at detecting the images that are not good at all and never will be no matter what edits we do. \u00a0We can hit delete with with out hesitation.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/f\/600_449625631.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Which boat image is stronger \u00a0A or B? Not sure? Do you see the difference?\u00a0<\/p> <p>The \u00a0majority of our images may be in the middle range, not great and not terrible, \u00a0where we are really not sure. Are they good? Could the be better? Should I keep or delete? You can quickly accumulate thousands of images in this mid range and never get back to them. We have good intensions but are just too busy to deal with these. They quickly get out of hand and before you know it you have thousands of maybe someday photos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are some powerful clear guidelines or criteria you can apply to your own work to make it stronger. I have been using these for years in my own work and now am happy to share them with you. I have a masters degree in Aesthetic Education, the science of beauty in nature and art, and can offer you some specific critiquing and judging skills you can use from this point on. \u00a0This will help you break the photo hoarding habit and delete delete delete.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is not so much about how to do the edits, but about what edits to do and why. This is not a class on using Lightroom. It is a workshop to cultivate your critical eye so you can more quickly judge your photos and decide what edits to do.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/f\/c\/600_345547932.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Which Flower Photo is stronger A. or B.?<\/b><\/p> <p>Some of the topics covered in this workshop:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Three essential questions to ask yourself to decide whether to keep or delete.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Four simple steps you can take to gently edit your best photos to make them even better.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to see the difference that makes the difference when comparing two photos of the same subject.

There are plenty of other classes out there on the use of Photoshop, Lightroom, or other editing software. We will focus on the CREATIVE SEEING PROCESS of judging your images to see and emphasize their strengths and edit out the visual distractions. Think of it as developing the \u201cgood eye\u201d so you can spot the keepers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Taking time to learn how to judge and gently edit your images during this day will also help you take better pictures in the future. Once you know what to look for, you can make these same choices while taking photos by editing your experience in the moment. This will save you time and effort in the future because then your photos will need very little editing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/2\/a\/600_449625610.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Which would you delete?<\/p> <p><br\/>This class will also build your confidence in your aesthetic judgment in sensing which images have that elusive quality that makes them shine. You know it when you see it, even if you can\u2019t quite name it. Learning to recognize this quality takes time, but in this class you will begin to learn how to move in that direction. We each have an inner guiding compass, a nose for the truth that guides us toward the images we long to take, the ones that capture the beauty of life and express something that will only be expressed through us.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/d\/8\/600_345534232.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Which shadow evokes a mood?<\/b><\/p> <p>How we will work:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I will start with an inspiring slide show of sample photos that went from good to GREAT with simple edits and provide the criteria. Once you see these clear examples, you can apply the same principles to your own work. I will explain harmony, balance, dynamic \u00a0tension and other aesthetic qualities.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You will look at your images and practice applying the criteria so you can sense the difference between what you like and what you love.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You will work with a partner to objectively look at the work of others and how to get and give constructive feedback.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I will show a slide show of simple edits you can easily make using iPhoto on a Mac computer. Even as you gently edit your images by cropping, lightening, or adding more contrast, you need to know how to judge how much, where, what, etc.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You will choose several of your own images from nature to apply the edits I demonstrate. THIS IS A HANDS ON WORKSHOP.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As always, we will have a social time at the end of class so you can join us for a quick glass of wine, a beer and snacks at the Bee Hive if you like.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Special note: This workshop is designed for Mac users. I am going to be demonstrating the editing tools on iPhoto. Please bring your laptop so you can work on your images during the class<\/b>. This class will be limited to 8 participants so if you would like to attend, please RSVP right away.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Many of you have asked for this class so I am very excited to be offering it now. I look forward to seeing you this Saturday. If you are a PC user and really want to attend, contact me and I will see what we can do to include you.

Step into the curio cabinet of an ambitious inventor who defies the laws of time, space and dimension in order to reinvent everything around him.

To make matters worse, David lives in a society where single people have 45 days to find true love, or else they are turned into the animal of their choice and released into the woods. David is kept at the mysterious HOTEL while he searches for a new partner, and after several romantic misadventures decides to make a daring escape to abandon this world. He ultimately joins up with a rebel faction known as The Loners, a group founded on a complete rejection of romance. But once there David meets an enigmatic stranger (Rachel Weisz) who stirs up unexpected and strong feelings within him\u2026. At once a full immersion into a strange and surreal world, and a witty and clever reflection of our own society,<i> The Lobster<\/i> is a thrillingly audacious vision fully brought to life by Lanthimos and his terrific cast, the perfect balance between sharp-edged satire and romantic fable.

Each light sword changes up to 6 colors is about 3' long, and you will be able to pick them up at the event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start to gather at 8:00, split into space warlocks (red swords) vs. space wizards (everyone else) a little after 9:00, and the battle will begin.

Of course that also means amazing crowds so I suggest we get there when it opens. Unfortunately that isn't until 8:00 am but that's probably still early enough to feel like we own the place once we get back into the grounds.

He also profoundly changed the language of sculpture by playing with accident and emphasizing the act of creating rather than completing a work of art. Rodin favored fragmentation and recombination as the principal expression of the significance he attached to change and transformation as the keys to creativity. Featuring sculptures and drawings, this thematic exhibition highlights the drama and experimentation that have established Rodin as one of the greatest sculptors of all time.<\/p> <p>Originally titled Metamorphoses: In Rodin's Studio, the exhibition is organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, in collaboration with the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris. The exhibition was curated by Nathalie Bondil, Director and Chief curator of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, with the assistance of Sylvain Cordier, Associate Curator and Curator of early decorative arts, and under the direction of Catherine Chevillot, Head Curator and Director of the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, by Sophie Biass-Fabiani, Curator of the Graphic Arts and Painting. The AMG Foundation sponsored the exhibition at the Peabody Essex Museum. Carolyn and Peter S. Lynch and The Lynch Foundation provided generous support. The East India Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum also provided support. The exhibition catalogue, with contributions on Rodin's process by leading scholars, is published by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the cafe 5th row from entry","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonArtEnthusiasts\/events\/231276862\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":10800000,"name":"Rodin - Transforming Sculpure at the PEM & Discussion","id":"231276862","time":1464544800000,"updated":1464609201000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221166586000,"name":"Boston Art Enthusiasts","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1280431,"urlname":"BostonArtEnthusiasts","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Art Exhibit Exthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"Amory street","name":"Amory Park","lon":-71.11451,"id":8700342,"state":"MA","lat":42.347469,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.43706274033,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463346700000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's actually warm again!

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward in an effort to stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues together as a community. We have seen a surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Considering a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas. We hope you'll come to this session willing to share your thoughts and knowledge on the events of the past month. If not, feel free to listen, learn, and participate in some really important conversations.

After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/231315169\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvhbnc","time":1464651000000,"updated":1464663117000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"44 Fifth Street","name":"Moves & Vibes Dance Studio","lon":-71.188751,"id":19335432,"state":"MA","lat":42.184925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5623426437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449460888000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>April 25th, Moves &amp; Vibes Dance Co starting a 8-week advance beginner Zouk beginners course.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right.

Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to run in the first place. You should ease into your 5K training plan gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you to begin running a 5K or 3.1 miles and on a regular basis in just two months.\u00a0 Each session should take about 20 or 30 minutes, three times a week. That just happens to be the same amount of moderate exercise recommended by numerous studies for optimum fitness. This program will get you fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting twice a week, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Saturday or Sunday to keep with the schedule.\u00a0 Remember to bring your sneakers and some water.<br\/>\u00a0\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com\/engine\/2\/2_3\/181.shtml<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.

Don't let the length intimidate you. Just focus on the first few minutes but do as much as you like.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aV8dS2m9Adc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/aV8dS2m9Adc<\/a><\/p> <p>I'm really excited about this event! We have permission to do a series of Beginner Salsa Lessons. (Swing lessons to follow if this is a success). Please help me make these a success by giving it a shot. You'll have a blast--trust me!<\/p> <p>Our instructors have years of dancing experience, plenty of personality and of course, I'll be providing the sound system with some great music. I've taken group lessons before where the music was too fast, esp in the open dance time. So we're going to gear this to 2 left-footed dancers like me. :)<\/p> <p><br\/>The Hanson Rec Commission members are very excited about this and want us to succeed. So please thank them when you see them at the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our plan is to have weekly dance lessons for 2 hours. These will be geared for beginners so don't be afraid. To You Salsa veterans - please come because we'll need your help too... and you can show off during the open dance hour.<\/p> <p><br\/>Once per month we'll be having a 4 hour dance with libations. We will announce these ahead of time....<\/p> <p><br\/>Gender equity? of course ladies bring a man with you but for the first few lessons gender equity won't be a huge issue. Nevertheless, put the pressure on the men you know, in the group and out, to make it to this. It's gonna be a blast!<\/p> <p>Please post questions below.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDIRECTIONS - Please use your GPS. For those of you who have never been, Hanson is only 30 min from Plymouth and Braintree. And only 15 min from Hanover or Brockton. So it's nice and centrally located. Camp Kiwanee is right on rt 58 with plenty of parking.<\/p> <p>The cost is $10 per person - a very reasonable price. FYI - I don't make a dime on this. Camp Kiwanee gets a percentage of the door and the remainder goes to the instructors and those working the door.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's a few pictures of Needles Lodge at Camp Kiwanee. It's a gem right here in our little one-horse town of Hanson.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/8\/e\/600_450293646.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>That's only about 2\/3rds of the room.

I've been working on this for a few months... 2 Hanson Rec Commission meetings later, increasing my liability insurance, signing my life away in a contract, approval from the town administrator and what seems to be 50 trips to this place. I have permission for us to do a series of Beginner Salsa Lessons. (swing lessons to follow if this is a success) I'll post 2 to start so please help me make these a success by giving it a shot. You'll have a blast trust me!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our instructors<\/b> have years of dancing experience, plenty of personality and of course I'll be providing the sound system with some great music. I've taken group lessons before and the music was too fast, esp in the open dance time. So we're going to gear this to 2 left footed neanderthal dancers like me.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Hanson Rec Commission members are very excited about this and want us to succeed. So thank them when you see them at the event.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our plan is to have weekly dances for 2 hours. The first hour will be a lesson and the 2nd an open dance. These will be geared for beginners so don't be afraid. To You Salsa veterans - please come because we'll need your help too... and you can show off during the open dance hour.<\/p> <p><br\/>Once per month we'll be having a bartender for a 4 hour dance. A little wine might loosen up the hips a little ;-) This first dance will be for 2 hours. The 2nd dance lesson on Feb 26th will have the bar and be open for 4 hours. (7-11 see the post for the 26th)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Gender equity<\/b>? of course ladies bring a man with you but for the first few lessons gender equity won't be a huge issue. Nevertheless, put the pressure on the men you know, in the group and out, to make it to this. It's gonna be a blast !<\/p> <p>Please post questions below.<\/p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS - <\/b>Please use your GPS. For those of you who have never been, Hanson is only 30 min from Plymouth and Braintree. And only 15 min from Hanover or Brockton. See it's nice and centrally located. Camp Kiwannee is right on rt 58 with plenty of parking.<\/p> <p><b>The cost is $10 per person<\/b> - a very reasonable price. FYI - I don't make a dime on this. Camp Kiwanee gets a percentage of the door and the remainder goes to the instructors and those working the door.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's a few pictures of Needles Lodge at Camp Kiwanee.

These values not only help members to consciously and proactively craft a life well-lived, they are a way of experiencing the world, a way that is not widely shared in the general population.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Engaging with other members of this community can be fascinating, supportive, and affirming for people who otherwise might believe that they are \"odd\" for having this important, extraordinary, and admirable combination of core values and characteristics.\u00a0<\/p> <p>(To see if you share these characteristics,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/pages\/Is_Personal_Growth_Right_for_You%3F\/\">take our ten-question questionnaire<\/a>.)\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>A Toolbox<\/i>\u00a0<br\/>PGN is a toolbox with which members can create events that support themselves and other members in the community. Members can create workshops, practice groups, and social events. Organizers might be trained, or they may have deep passion, or they may just want to share their journey, their gifts, their joys, their successes, their vision, or their interests.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For these \"leaders\" in our community, PGN provides software, training, and support, and respectful access to the core people in the personal growth community who may be interested in joining them in their gifts.<\/p> <p><i>A Marketplace<br\/><\/i>And finally, PGN is a marketplace, where leaders uncover numerous ways to serve more people more profoundly and more effectively. \u00a0Providers can offer their service broadly, discover and try out new techniques, tools and approaches, find out what works best\u00a0for them, and iterate towards excellence. \u00a0Members can sample different providers, comparing sometimes side by side, and decide what makes the most sense to them for their next step in their life.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Orientation Series<\/b><\/p> <p>Given the enormous ambition and power of the Personal Growth Network, and its rapid growth, it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed at first, so we offer some \"How-To\" guides to maximize your utilization of the Personal Growth Network for whatever your goals may be. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Our Orientations include:<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>For Participants<\/b><\/i>\u00a0<br\/>- Newbie Introduction:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Personal-Growth-Network\/events\/230141117\/\">Wed Jun 15<br\/><\/a>. . . . . . . . .

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.
