We are a smallish sized group that enjoys playing together once every week or two at the local public golf courses.&nbsp;<span>Please note that this is NOT a singles meetup type of event. It's for people who enjoy playing golf and enjoy it that much more when playing with a compatible group. &nbsp;<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My ideal is to have eight people (for two foursomes) for each outing. At this point, we have a core of 3 to 4 people who show up most of the time. Others have then joined in a meetup just on occasion. That's all fine. Playing with new(ish) members of the group is part of what makes it fun.&nbsp;<\/span><span>As space permits, bring along a friend to play if that helps round out getting two full foursomes.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Although I'm mostly thinking of a group of guys playing golf, I don't want to be exclusionary. Women would be welcome. So far this summer a couple of women have played. Last summer no women played golf with our group. Hey, whatever.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>If you can say \"yes\" to most of these questions then you would be pretty compatible with the group:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. You're a young senior. ... For myself I'm 62. But ages in the group range.<\/p>\n<p>2. You're available during weekdays to play. ... Wanted so we can get cheaper rates. Being retired or semi-retired helps.<\/p>\n<p>3. You're nearby (within 7 or so miles of Cranford). ... This ties in with keeping the group small.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. You play in the area. ... As for me, I normally play at these public courses: Hyatt Hills, Ashbrook, &amp; Galloping Hill. &nbsp;We also play at some courses farther afield (like the Rutgers golf course) and have had fun with it. From a survey of the group most members want a variety in the courses we play and are also up for higher end courses on occasion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. You can ALREADY play golf. ... You can be somewhat poor, average, or quite good. ... My own handicap is a 26 (on the weak side, but seriously hope to improve). ... Note: Let me add that in joining this group <i>you pretty much need to be able to break 100 at least on occasion<\/i> (my definition of \"somewhat poor\"). <i>BUT<\/i> if you can keep up your pace of play this can offset playing poorly. ... Frankly, at this writing we are trying to determine what works best. I want to be inclusive (especially given that I don't always break 100 myself). But then it can be frustrating for some of the better golfers if they have to deal with slow play. So if you don't play reasonably well you need to be sure you can keep up your pace of play so that you don't hold up everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>6. You follow good golf etiquette. ... You know and follow the rules. But if you need a mulligan please take it. &nbsp;And to keep up our pace of play &nbsp;again we follow \"ready golf\". That means you don't need to wait for the farthest away to hit first if you're ready to hit.<\/p>\n<p>7. Good attitude. ... Even if your game is going poorly you enjoy being out and can joke around with others. 'Nuff said? I think so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p> <span>We also sometimes try to add some competition to add to the fun of playing. One thing we've done at times is to use match play with two person teams. Each team takes their best score for each hole and tries to beat the other team(s) best score on a hold-by-hole basis. You can of course still keep your own personal score.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>So let's keep it simple and fun.

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give. This work demands of us at all times a deepened understanding and an increased ability to penetrate to new levels of consciousness so lifting humanity as a whole. http:\/\/www.lucistrust.org\/en\/service_activities\/start_a_meditation_group\/resource_center","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193144989,"name":"Lucis Trust","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/highres_250178629.jpeg","photo_id":250178629,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/member_250178629.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/thumb_250178629.jpeg"}},"members":52,"name":"New York Meditation as a Way of Life","id":18986696,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-as-a-Way-of-Life","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443731112000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-growing-professionals\/","rating":4.66,"description":"<p>When you no longer feel a true connection with the crowd you grew up with and the co-workers...

It's a Movement born out of a weariness with the status quo that puts HR leaders and doers in a box. WGNinHR is busting us out of those boxes, and breaking all paradigms. It's for those who dare to ask 'what's next?', expecting to be challenged to new levels in HR - or even outside of it...to the C-Suite and perhaps, eventually, to the top seat. After launching as a (virtual) membership organization (<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgninhr.org\">www.wgninhr.org<\/a><\/b>), WGNinHR is now ready to establish a NY presence. If you'd like to meet like-minded HR pros looking for creative ways to advance their careers, join this growing Movement - and become a part of our Meetup. &nbsp;The Meetups will include networking, light refreshments and interactive learning opportunities!<\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s in a Name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On playgrounds across the nation, and maybe even the globe, someone is screaming out a familiar question \u2013 \u2018who\u2019s got next?!\u2019&nbsp; The question is asked of the person confident enough to step onto the court or playground, grab the ball \u2013 and then do something <i>amazing<\/i> with it.&nbsp; That\u2019s where the name for this organization came from.&nbsp; Its focus is on the HR professional who dares to not only ask the \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 question, but to shape the answer! <\/p>\n<p>This is a Movement looking to challenge your thinking, and that of the folks who surround you who may be suffocating your career aspirations, perhaps unintentionally. The fact is, too many HR pros are convinced that they can\u2019t aspire to more \u2013 in their fields, outside their fields, to the C-Suite and even to the CEO seat.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is for you.&nbsp; Whether you\u2019re the aspiring HR pro having just graduated and in your first HR gig, or the more seasoned among us with 20+ years of HR and business experience.&nbsp; This is for you <i>if <\/i>you truly believe that there\u2019s more to your career story.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>NY Trailblazers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The goal is a monthly meetup like no other.&nbsp; Yes, there will be networking which is awesome. Yes, there will be refreshments to give us the energy boost at the end of a day.&nbsp; But, we\u2019ll strive for even more.&nbsp; Creativity.&nbsp; Innovation.&nbsp; New \u2013 and quirky \u2013 thinking about old issues and hot topics which impact HR leaders aspiring for more.&nbsp; Interactive learning sessions will serve as incubators for ideas that may ultimately position HR leaders as the smartest people in the room\u2026.whether it\u2019s the conference room or the board room.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want to Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If this group resonates with you, we\u2019d love to have you!

I am calling this conclave Voki-all-joyo. Each week, on Sunday morning, we will meet for a presentation, discussion, and sharing of ideas. These ideas are meant to be about the issues most important to your heart: <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;Why are you here? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you believe? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you learn? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How do you succeed? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp; What should you being doing to make the world better? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How can you be happy(ier)?<\/p>\n<p>This is not about doctrine, dogma, or definiteness. This is about dialectics, discourse, and discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Each week a topic or theme will be presented around ideas or thoughts from the realms of science, western philosophy, eastern philosophy, and literature. I draw on the world of many great western minds, including: Thoreau, Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, Sun Tzu, Epictetus, Jung, Aquinas, Fromm, James..\u2026 and as a Sanskrit theorist I draw on many of the ancient Vedic texts, the Mahabharata, The Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Upanishads, The Bengali poets and scholars, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the topics will be about yoga, science, meditation, philosophy, and basically all things that can be used to help us explore how to both think more clearly and at the same time reside happily in the cloud of unknowing.<\/p>\n<p>Each week I will offer a presentation about the topic that is no more than 17 minutes long.&nbsp;We will then have a discussion on the topic, and sharing time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>So, remember to bring something that inspires you to share. It can be a piece of music, a photo, a poem, or even a short anecdote.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>I will close the session with some brief remarks, and then go to brunch, or, if the weather is nice, on a picnic.

I speak four languages and can read and write Sanskrit. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in educational psychology. I am spiritual, but not religious. I am agnostic, but not atheistic. I am rational, but not close-minded. I am here to be of service to others. I like art, history, science, music, literature, and things that buzz or blink. I think coming together as a community on Sunday mornings has value, but I\u2019m not into church. I want to grow and learn in the company of my peers, and friends, free from the dictates of dogma and blue hair.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I have created Voki-all-joyo (phonetic for voki al \u011dojo.) This is Esperanto (one of my favorite languages) for Call to Joy. I named it this because I am convinced that our constitutional position as spirits in a human form is to be full of joy. I aIso feel strongly that clear thinking is the best path to real joy. Please note, when I say, \u2018be full of joy\u2019, I do not mean joy in some horribly homogeneous way, like a narcotized, monolithically emotional state. I mean joy, as in a rich state of appreciation and wonder at the mystery and beauty of life. (Like the feeling you get when you find a box of Twinkies in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland.)<\/p>\n<p>So, think of this as a pasta sea of fellow swimmers who are looking for what binds us together without being bound up by the ligaments of human speculation.

Through this group we can grow lasting friendships, share advice, and also organize future playdates. We can even get together to have a few mommy night out events, which I'm sure we will all need. I hope to have a new meetup each week in which we can get together to chat, attend workshops, and even have pampering events.

This comes in many forms, whether it is an individual deciding to turn their car off while waiting to pick up a friend instead of idling or a food service provider choosing to to donate their excess inventory at the end of a day instead of throwing it out; these are only two examples out of hundreds, maybe thousands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have turned many of these actions into programs and campaigns and are always looking for opportunities to grow them or develop new ones. By building a face-to-face community, we hope to engage more of the Stamford community in our work and make our city a leader in food and transportation fuel sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sustainable America is a national non-profit located in Stamford, CT. We focus on our nation's food and transportation fuel systems because they are inextricably connected and not as robust as they may appear.

I've been a resident of the Upper East side for a number of years, and I often find myself traveling out of my own neighborhood to meet up with friends all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice for me to come home after work and go to a happy hour locally or get out of bed on the weekend and not have to spend time commuting to meet friends for brunch downtown or on the west side of town.&nbsp; So I decided to create&nbsp;a group that caters to those of us between the age of 25-45 years of age who would like to get together&nbsp;for Happy Hours and Brunch events throughout the week and on the weekends. <br> <br>Happy Hour and Brunch events will be the main types&nbsp;of&nbsp;get togethers&nbsp;we will host initially, but&nbsp;my hope is to expand by sharing events hosted by other UES groups as well.&nbsp; This way you will have one place to find out about&nbsp;events, instead of having to join 50 meetup groups to keep on top of things on the UES.&nbsp; If you are an organizer of another group, please contact me and I would love to place your event on our calendar.&nbsp; My second goal is to set up potlucks, trips to other parts of the city and out of town, cooking classes, and other events to create a greater sense of community.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>As of April 1st 2016,&nbsp;look for all events in our calendar that say \"Living on the Upper East Side - Happy Hour and Brunch(HH+B)\" for get togethers that&nbsp;are hosted by our organizers.&nbsp; Our group events will never be more than 15-20 people, which should allow for diversity&nbsp;in the&nbsp;types of people you will meet but&nbsp;an event wont be&nbsp;too large that you will get lost in the crowd.&nbsp; We take your recommendations for favorite places in the area seriously, and hope to plan events based around your feedback.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you at one of our future events.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Living on the Upper East Side - Happy Hour and Brunch (HH+B)<\/p>\n<p>S.A.W.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/0\/2\/highres_448658402.jpeg","photo_id":448658402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/0\/2\/600_448658402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/0\/2\/thumb_448658402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193641842,"name":"Social Associations Worldwide","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/e\/d\/highres_250290957.jpeg","photo_id":250290957,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/e\/d\/member_250290957.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/8\/e\/d\/thumb_250290957.jpeg"}},"members":154,"name":"Living on the Upper East Side","id":19014645,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Upper-East-Side-Happy-Hours","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"HH+B Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444521515000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"nondualism","name":"Nondualism","id":9239},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"non-dual-spirituality","name":"Non-Dual Spirituality","id":105159}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dialogues-with-George\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A meetup group for exploring the application of mindfulness, Buddhism and non-duality in daily life.

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

Research show's that being a part of a community that shared your goals is integral to achieving them. Personally, I've always participated in team sports or activities like football, wrestling, rugby, and martial arts. What keeps me coming back and engaged is the community and camaraderie inherent in these group activities. Weightlifting is another matter though. I know my way around a gym, but lifting alone is difficult for me. The lack of accountability and engagement usually leads me to modifying routines that shouldn't be modified or abandoning lifting all together and focussing on my group activities (Currently Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). So my goal for this group is to find some more buddies who want to partner with me on lifting. I'm going to be on the program outlined in \"Man 2.0, Engineering the Alpha.\" This group is for guys like me, to find other guys like me, so that we can do this together!

I chose personal development!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I have studied this industry for over a decade and was privileged to meet some very rich and wealthy people. Over the years I have only practiced strategies used by the wealthy and it has transformed my life from not being able to afford most things to now-being able to live a life free of financial boundaries. As a result I wanted to share what I've learned from self-improvement and the only way I could do that was to create a new word, \"Selfceed\". Selfceed means to succeed in self, building a sound character that runs on a core philosophy of, you are what you attract by the person you become. &nbsp;The Selfceed Forum is essentially a <b><i>book club forum<\/i><\/b> designed to help members make more money, manage their time and problems better by interacting with like-minded individuals who practice self-improvement. Our only requirement is that when you join us, you come with an open mind and a coachable outlook.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Napoleon Hill invested decades into exploring what millionaires and billionaires<i><b>&nbsp;in America<\/b><\/i> had in common. He discovered that a <b><i>key<\/i><\/b> factor in their practices included \"<i><b>A Mastermind Group<\/b><\/i>\" which involved getting around like-minded individuals brainstorming on how to get ahead and The Selfceed Forum can be your mastermind group! I have invested over a decade into this field and I would like for you all to help evolve this concept to be more mainstream by empowering others who really need a hand up, not a hand out.

From a self-defense aspect it can end an attack suddenly, severely and decisively or dissipate it with the gentleness of a soft breeze. <\/p>\n<p> <br>Aikido's unique approach is to blend with an attack rather than clash with it. The attack is redirected safely away into a throw or pin. Its circular, flowing techniques are effective and can be learned by anyone regardless of size, age or gender. Men, women, children and seniors all find it appealing because Aikido techniques are not based on pitting one's strength against another's. Students learn to defend themselves without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Self esteem, concentration, awareness and focusing power are enhanced. Balance and calmness are therefore maintained in all situations. This state of being is then carried off the mat and into the activity and interactions of daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers was established in 1988 after Sensei O'Connor had been studying and teaching for 12 years.

For example, a technique does not work by itself unless combined with the concepts of balance, power, speed, focus, timing, and attitude. When combining these elements, the outcome or whole is far more effective then what would normally be the sum of the parts. This is the reason techniques, as practiced in the system, are only tools used to understand, accept and retain these ideas. The number of different techniques mastered by an individual does not increase his level of competence in this system. Techniques are only practiced moves until combined with the proper fighting concepts. The ultimate goal of the martial arts is to make your mental, physical and technical skills work as one. The goal of Latosa Escrima is to do this while producing a quality Escrimador who can think creatively and react responsively rather than giving people information overload. Escrima was the original name used under the flag of the Philippine Martial Arts Society. The name changed to Combat Escrima as the system was influenced by the concept of using power and combat reality. Combat Escrima relied on a single goal; winning. This goal proved to be a very valuable asset. The intimidation factor of the name \"Combat Escrima\" was something the students felt they had to defend. However, just the goal of winning actually proved limiting in the progression of the system and future instructors. PMAS produced excellent fighters and world champions but failed to produce very many well-rounded instructors. PMAS had the box recipe for producing competent fighters but failed to isolate the individual ingredients that make up the end product. Latosa spent his time developing training methods used to understand the reasoning behind the techniques and isolating the concepts of Escrima. Wing Tzun is self defense in it's most consequent form Wing Tzun is the smartest self-defense system ever thought of by humankind, because Wing Tzun is not based upon physical strength or acrobatic ability and therefore allows a physically weaker person to defend him\/herself. Wing Tzun teaches you to use the force of the opponent and turn it against him. Wing Tzun self defense movements derive from tactile reflexes that are mechanical and directly determined by the attack of the opponent. In this way WT is not susceptible to optical manipulations meant to mislead the fighter. Wing Tzun can be learned fairly quickly and built upon. Wing Tzun meets the demands of \"appropriate force\" and therefore lends itself for use by law enforcement.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192115611,"name":"Rawb Prime","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/highres_249326551.jpeg","photo_id":249326551,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/member_249326551.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/thumb_249326551.jpeg"}},"members":11,"name":"Latosa Escrima and Wing Tsun Meetup","id":19036470,"state":"NY","urlname":"Latosa-Escrima-and-Wing-Tsun-Meetup","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Escrimadors and Technicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445132274000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sake","name":"Sake","id":9744},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-food","name":"Japanese Food","id":25545},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"sake-pairing","name":"Sake Pairing","id":136330}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sakeplus-ny\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To drink up with sake lovers from all over the world!<\/p>\n<p>We select only delicious sake for a season, and we invite sake professionals like Touji (sake brewers), Kikizake-shi (sake sommelier).<\/p>\n<p>Let's enjoy cheers!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/highres_443142114.jpeg","photo_id":443142114,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/600_443142114.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/thumb_443142114.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182462174,"name":"Yuki Ono","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/highres_250630117.jpeg","photo_id":250630117,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/member_250630117.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/thumb_250630117.jpeg"}},"members":82,"name":"[SAKE+] Sake Samurai in NY!","id":19036932,"state":"NY","urlname":"sakeplus-ny","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sake Samurai"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445133911000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"interracial-dating","name":"Interracial Dating","id":25504},{"urlkey":"dating-relationship-advice","name":"Dating & Relationship Advice","id":70113},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613},{"urlkey":"internet-dating","name":"Internet Dating","id":113418},{"urlkey":"dating-advice-for-women","name":"Dating Advice For Women","id":145615},{"urlkey":"meeting-and-attracting-men","name":"Meeting and Attracting Men","id":1504314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rules-Dating-Advice-For-Women-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is the first Meetup group that encourages &amp; supports The Rules.

Participants will learn how to develop their musicianship more quickly by utilizing modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam groups since 2010. &nbsp;The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the ABB. &nbsp;These sessions are a lot of fun. &nbsp;Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the ABB with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.&nbsp; Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.&nbsp; Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.&nbsp; Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. &nbsp;Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.&nbsp; Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN: <\/p>\n<p>The music of The Allman Brothers Band is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. &nbsp;However, learning the music of the ABB can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I can help you learn. &nbsp;This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the ABB played it. &nbsp;The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.&nbsp; I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.&nbsp; The charts are clear about song form,&nbsp;intros, &nbsp;chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.&nbsp; Both Duane Allman and Dicky Betts' parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In most cases, Berry Oakley's bass lines have been transcribed. &nbsp;The ABB shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose. <\/p>\n<p>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN: <\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord&nbsp;progressions and song&nbsp;forms; the actual chord voicings;&nbsp;specific chord progressions used during the improv sections; slide guitar techniques; pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;&nbsp;chord\/scale combinations; use of chromaticism; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation to improvise.&nbsp; There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.&nbsp; People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation. <\/p>\n<p>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. &nbsp;In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on many songs including: &nbsp; Staesboro Blues, Trouble No More, Don't Keep me Wonderin', Done Somebody Wrong, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Dreams, Blue Sky, Hot 'Lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Little Martha, Midnight Rider, Mountain Jam, Stormy Monday, Whipping Post, You Don't Love Me and others.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE COORDINATOR:<\/p>\n<p>I am a professional musician with over 40 years experience. I began playing the guitar at four years old and performing professionally at 15. &nbsp;I've performed all over the world at countless venues and festivals. &nbsp;Additionally, I teach privately and at a variety of music schools. &nbsp;As a performer and recording artist I play many styles of music including rock, blues, jazz and folk.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/highres_443233561.jpeg","photo_id":443233561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/600_443233561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_443233561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13972016,"name":"Luke Johnson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/highres_12000209.jpeg","photo_id":12000209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/member_12000209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/thumb_12000209.jpeg"}},"members":23,"name":"New York City Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam","id":19041096,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Allman-Brothers-Band-Song-and-Jam","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"ABB Jammers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445269204000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"programming-languages","name":"Programming Languages","id":17628},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Pluralsight-Study-group\/","rating":0,"description":"The Hoboken Pluralsight Study Group was started because we love the idea of the NYC Pluralsight Study Group, but we wanted something a bit easier to attend.

In this lively, interactive workshop, Robert Vetter deconstructs processes of spiritual healing found in cultures found all over the world, and shares a formula for healing that can be adapted to almost any energetic or spiritual healing discipline. By looking at the methods of other cultures, you will understand on a deeper level what healing is, how it works, and the ways that various healers master a universal code that underlies the healing process.\n\nWorkshop topics include:\n\n\u2022 Understanding your calling as a healer\n\u2022 Developing a healing presence\n\u2022 Respectfully borrowing healing practices from other cultures\n\u2022 Constructing altars to invoke the power of symbols in healing\n\u2022 Engaging all 5 senses in healing\n\u2022 Grasping a deeper meaning that underlies the wounded healer archetype\n\u2022 Methods of self-protection that you can implement in your practice\n\u2022 The power of narrative medicine: using words to heal\n\u2022 Acquiring healing energy\n\u2022 Soul retrieval and re-integration\n\nDuring this workshop, you will develop your own unique healing protocol that is a reflection of who you are on your individual journey. In learning to heal using this method, you will also uncover how healing is a spiritual path that directs us through the entire cycle of human life, imbuing it with meaning and purpose.\n\nRobert Vetter, M.A. is a cultural anthropologist, who began his studies of cross cultural healing practices at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980\u2019s. He has apprenticed and learned from a variety of teachers in modalities that include traditional Mesoamerican medicine (Curanderismo), Native North American medicine, and Medical or Healing Qigong among others. He maintains a healing practice in what he calls Ethno-Energetic Healing. He is the co-author (along with his adopted uncle, Kiowa medicine man, Richard Tartsah) of the book Big Bow: The Spiritual Life and Teachings of a Kiowa Family. He is vice president of Joshua\u2019s Place Center for Healing in Southampton, NY. He has taught at the New York Open Center, Wainwright House, Mount Madonna Center in the San Francisco Bay area, The Sanctuary at Mount Shasta, and many other venues.\n\nExchange: $65","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":72465082,"name":"Awakening NY","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/highres_246562844.jpeg","photo_id":246562844,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/member_246562844.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/thumb_246562844.jpeg"}},"members":22,"name":"Healing Spirituality As A Life Journey","id":19041709,"state":"NY","urlname":"Healing-Spirituality-As-A-Life-Journey","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Healers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445273477000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-health","name":"Women's Health","id":16973},{"urlkey":"natural-health","name":"Natural Health","id":17124},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"womens-support-group-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Support Group Health and Wellness","id":94489},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477},{"urlkey":"womens-sexual-health","name":"Women's Sexual Health","id":222511},{"urlkey":"women-health","name":"Women health","id":1407762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Premenstrual-Dysphoric-Disorder-PMDD-Support\/","rating":0,"description":"PMDD is more than a little bloating and cramping before a period. It is a mood disorder that accompanies the other premenstrual symptoms. The PMDD gets more severe as the period draws near, escalating the sufferer to a state of very high tension, anxiety and aggression. It enhances other coexisting mood disorders to complicate any treatment for several days during the month. PMDD is thought to be a brain chemistry malfunction that is triggered by ovulation. Symptoms usually begin after ovulation and last into the first days of the period. This cycle repeats itself every month. PMDD is tied to the hormonal changes triggered by ovulation, so it does not occur without this part of the menstrual cycle. The condition affects up to 8 percent of women. The condition involves much more than a bad time during a period. It is cyclical, occurring at the same point in the menstrual cycle each month. The symptoms of PMDD are severe and usually life altering. Doctors require sufferers to have at least five of the following symptoms to support a diagnosis: Depression of hopeless feelings Feelings of anxiousness, tension or edge Irritability that increases as period nears Oversleeping or insomnia Lack of interest in favorite things No motivation Loss of energy Difficulty focusing and concentrating Loss of control feelings, feeling overwhelmed Severe physical manifestation of PMS symptoms like tender breasts, cramping, bloating, muscle pain and weight gain Suicidal thoughts Source: http:\/\/www.psychguides.com\/guides\/living-with-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\/ Message from Organizer: Last year I learned that I have PMDD. The only thing I found that truly helps the mental aspect of PMDD is joining online forums where other women discuss their experiences with PMDD, thus learning that I am not alone. I am making this group so members can meet and give support to other PMDD suffers. I'm calling the members \"Lunar Girls\" because of how we're affected by our cycle, much like the moon. I thought about calling us werewolves but that seemed a bit extreme.

Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter. The Song Club is led by the founder of the Collective -Peter Bliss. The Collective Song Club\u201d will begin on October 14th and follow every other Wednesday evening (skipping the night before Thanksgiving). It will take place at Planet Studio NYC (www.planetstudionyc.com) 244 West 54th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue in Suite 800B on the 8th floor. It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like! There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage! The CSC is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see! Join us for our first session on October 14th and let\u2019s see what happens! Peter Bliss \/ Profile: Peter Bliss songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties. He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film. He\u2019s shared his expertise creating workshop and event programs for the Songwriters Hall of Fame and now the New York Songwriters Collective. Peter works from his \u201cPlanet Studio NYC\u201d recording studios located in Manhattan, arranging, recording and producing other artists to help bring their music to life. Peter is once again taking to the stage singing his own songs.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":29283852,"name":"Peter Bliss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/d\/3\/highres_250715795.jpeg","photo_id":250715795,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/d\/3\/member_250715795.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/d\/3\/thumb_250715795.jpeg"}},"members":498,"name":"New York Songwriters Collective","id":19046161,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Songwriters-Collective","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Elmhurst","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445388877000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"healing","name":"Healing","id":16151},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"self-awareness","name":"Self-Awareness","id":25179},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"mindfulness-meditation","name":"Mindfulness Meditation","id":70577},{"urlkey":"positive-thinking-and-positive-affirmations","name":"Positive Thinking and Positive Affirmations","id":550602},{"urlkey":"pain-relief-stress-relief-holistic-support","name":"Pain Relief \u2022 Stress Relief \u2022 Holistic Support","id":827882},{"urlkey":"self-healing-self-improvement-health-education","name":"Self-Healing \u2022 Self-Improvement \u2022 Health Education","id":827912},{"urlkey":"self-help-self-improvement","name":"Self Help & Self Improvement","id":1506756}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jackson-Heights-Meditation\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Everyone knows that Meditation is good.

Hopefully it will also build into a local support group where we can help each other based on our personal Manhattan experiences - example collating good agents for houses - recommending the best restaurants, indian and other wise etc.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11991071,"name":"Rashmeeta","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/1\/1\/highres_250736849.jpeg","photo_id":250736849,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/1\/1\/member_250736849.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/1\/1\/thumb_250736849.jpeg"}},"members":260,"name":"Indians in Manhattan","id":19048539,"state":"NY","urlname":"Indians-in-Manhattan","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"IIM (Indian's in Manhattan)"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bayside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445450144000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"fun-and-laughter","name":"Fun and Laughter","id":18795},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"singles-who-love-to-travel-travel","name":"Singles Who Love to Travel Travel","id":64816},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Travel-Adventure-and-Fun\/","rating":4.8,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/4\/a\/600_443508970.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/f\/7\/1\/600_443509009.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>This group is for active, fun loving people with an interest in travel.

FINALLY, a \" Meet Up\" for high functioning young adults living at home or a group home. I am specifically talking about the young people with disabilities that can do so much more socially and want to, but that their socialization some how ends at the programs they attend for various reasons. They do not have friends in the neighborhood, and want to \"fit in\" so badly but don't! Parents, I say ENOUGH, it's got to start with us! Please if you are as frustrated as I am, lets get together, and HELP! Lets help and brainstorm and make this happen! I personally, have a 32 yr old high functioning daughter at home, who is lucky enough to have a 34 yr. old sister who loves and adores her. But as we all know 'its not enough\"! These young people need friends, they need their peers! They need movie dates, bowling dates, parties to attend, or just taking turn hang out at each others house. Parents, as you have already found out the first step to help will always be family. I am looking for dedicated mothers, fathers, sisters , brothers or whoever that family member might consist of. If your plain tired and sad of seeing your grown young adult home alone on the entire weekend with no plans , no friends, or sitting in their room watching a funny movie alone then reach out and lets move forward together. It just begins with one or two of us to start a network of friends for are kids, then before you know it, they are no longer alone!<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/highres_241621249.jpeg","photo_id":241621249,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/member_241621249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/thumb_241621249.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"Socializing For High Functioning Young Adults in Westchester","id":19048902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Socializing-For-High-Functioning-Young-Adults","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"True Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445457886000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence","id":10538},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"qlikview","name":"Qlikview","id":60832},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-tools-and-technology","name":"Business Intelligence Tools and Technology","id":148287},{"urlkey":"tableau","name":"Tableau","id":168154},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"tableau-software","name":"Tableau Software","id":1433052},{"urlkey":"qlik-sense","name":"Qlik Sense","id":1505900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Qlikview-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone utilizing QlikView or&nbsp;Tableau&nbsp;on the BI Platform.

But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute. Yet paid care is out of reach for many.

You'll be able to say the story of something you work on in one sentence, the major dramatic question. We'll analyze short stories, plays and novels to see their structure. Plus there are some short written exercises, and you can work on something you're writing.","lon":-73.9599990845,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194483657,"name":"Richard Greene","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/c\/highres_250767484.jpeg","photo_id":250767484,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/c\/member_250767484.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/c\/thumb_250767484.jpeg"}},"members":73,"name":"New York Writers, Agents, Editors, Producers, Actors Meetup","id":19052067,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Writers-Agents-Editors-Producers-Actors-Meetup","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Story makers & tellers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Summit","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445549348000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wholefood","name":"Whole Food Nutrition","id":5951},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"clean-eating","name":"Clean eating","id":47008}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Eating-For-Health-Weight-Loss\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for women who are interested in healthy eating and for moms who are interested in providing nourishing meals and snacks for their families.

This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I took a basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen.

Aren\u2019t you an extension of the higher power you believe in, a piece of what has made up this entire universe? As that, shouldn\u2019t you be able to mold your own universe, your own life, into whatever you choose? With as little struggle and as much fun as you would if you were placing an order and selecting what you wanted from a catalog?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yes you are, and yes you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The truth is <\/b>that the voice within you, the one that\u2019s always known and the one that\u2019s always guiding you - perhaps even to these words right now - is right. The road to whatever transformation you are in search of is an ACCELERATED one- or it can be given the right mentor and the right tools. From my heart to yours, I invite you to experience first-hand how accelerated the transformation that\u2019s been calling you can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>I decided to start this group<\/b> because as a master coach and successful entrepreneur, I notice so many people (including myself at one point in time) in what I call the \u201chamster wheel\u201d of never achieving their goals, where it seems to them that they never will or worse that their experience of getting there is such a struggle that they rob themselves from the joy of the process. It hurts me to see this as so many people's experience, just as much as it hurt me to experience it once myself... and it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The purpose of this meet up is <\/b>for you to discover and uncover what within you is truly holding you back and be given the tools on how to transform that in the most accelerated way. I'll be sharing a way for you to literally shift your existing reality to the one you desire - immediately. I'm sure you\u2019ve heard that many times before, but the difference this time is that I\u2019m not \"just saying this to you\"\u2026 I\u2019m <b>claiming<\/b> this <b>for you <\/b>and inviting you to claim this for yourself<b>.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What gives me the right<\/b> to claim that? Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve DONE with my own life and now it's what I so deeply want for yours. Earlier this year, it was my own voice within that guided me to receiving these tools from my mentor which ended up being THE biggest quantum shift of my life - I tell you, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is beating so fast with the truth that I do not even recognize myself! It is from this place that a fire within me exists to personally guide you to through your own experience of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The very tools that I was given to use for my own accelerated evolution are the very tools that you are being offered right now. I invite you to come find out what those are! Talk is cheap and your personal experience of what I\u2019m sharing with you is stronger than any of my words. Once you get to know me, you\u2019ll learn that I\u2019m not about the fluff, but rather the real \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d to arrive at the transformation you\u2019re looking for... and it's my greatest fulfillment to provide that for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Therefore, these meet-ups are FREE<\/b>\u2026 you have nothing to lose and more than you could ever imagine to gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>So, are you ready?

Location: Manhattan). Learn to articulate your value and values with ease, savvy, and style. Our attention spans are shorter. Our lives are busier. And our mental hard drives are at capacity. So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience. Workshop participants will be able to get on your feet, practice, and start to make some connections with other professionals. Post packet PDF included.

We hope to build a community that meets face to face in New York for folks interested in Apache Apex.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Apex unifies stream and batch processing. Use cases include ingestion, fast real-time analytics, data movement, disastor recovery in Hadoop, ETL, fast batch, alerts and real-time actions. Apex is a Hadoop-native YARN implementation. It simplifies development and productization of Hadoop applications by reducing time to market. Key features include Enterprise Grade Operability with Fault Tolerance, State Management, Event Processing Guarantees, No Data Loss, High Performance, Linear Scalability. Additionally Apache Apex includes Apache Malhar library of over 400 reusable operators (functions). These include connectors to external systems like message bus, file systems, databases, etc. Apache Apex enables users to run any user defined code natively in Hadoop.<\/p>\n<p>We expect to develop a strong community that meets face to face and has a deep influence on big data ecosystem.

And everyone already has it \u2014 including you. Become balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. If you're having trouble juggling the challenges in your life, Sahaja Yoga Meditation can help you manage stress, master your emotions and find solutions to your problems.

Within each of us are layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your own way. And our experts are always available to help. Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of Sahaja Yoga Meditation every day may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy (called kundalini in the yogic tradition) and light the path to lifelong transformation.

Once I found that peace and meaning in my life, I felt the need to pay it forward.&nbsp; It is great to know where you want to go by having goals and while savings and investments are certainly important, they are not everything.&nbsp; Now let\u2019s take it a step further and gain some peace of mind by getting totally clear about our current personal cash flows.&nbsp; Let's do this without having destination disease - curious about what that is? Show up and learn how to move past that phase.<\/p>\n<p>Let's be present in the movement and transparent about our future actions.&nbsp; Let\u2019s be proactive, be the catalyst to change and always be prepared to react to the new unforseen events that affect our lives.&nbsp; Let's build with like-minded people that are thinking clear and concisely about their current cash flows.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We will then continue by disecting some case studies of life situations that might cause one to lose that said peace of mind and then best practices on how to move forward with a safe and sound mindset.&nbsp; While we go through our presentation, we will discuss hidden current costs that can effect your current monetary situations.&nbsp; We will also be sharing solutions to create a sanctuary in ourselves by getting clear on our cash flow realities. We suggest you share issues and solutions throughout the process.&nbsp;We always make sure to leave at least 15 to 30mins for networking encouragement and questions.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194076751,"name":"Kevin Jean-Charles","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/highres_251237385.jpeg","photo_id":251237385,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/member_251237385.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/thumb_251237385.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"NYC Peace with Cash flows Meetup","id":19100692,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-PeacewithCashflows","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cash Flow Peace Encouragers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446957333000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"volleyball","name":"Volleyball","id":705},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"beach-volleyball","name":"Beach Volleyball","id":18266},{"urlkey":"indoor-volleyball","name":"Indoor Volleyball","id":22155},{"urlkey":"volleyball-league","name":"Volleyball League","id":23851},{"urlkey":"wallyball","name":"Wallyball","id":26975}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Wallyball-Club\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Who we are:&nbsp;<\/b><span>Brooklyn Wallyball club has called Eastern Athletic Club (EAC) it's home since 1981. &nbsp;In that time it has become the undisputed all time winningest Wallyball program anywhere in the country &nbsp;with more than 70 National titles at all levels in all divisions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>If you are either an Open or Advanced level Volleyball\/Wallyball &nbsp;player we encourage you to join this meetup and come join us for a great and&nbsp;<\/span>competitive<span>&nbsp;Wallyball game.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><b>Location:&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/span><span>Eastern Athletic Club (EAC) &nbsp;43 Clark St. Brooklyn,N.Y. &nbsp; Closest Subway is the Clark Street station on the 2\/3 line<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Time: <\/b>&nbsp;Every&nbsp;<\/span><span>SUNDAY 3pm -7pm<\/span><\/p>\n<p> We will assess your basic Volleyball skills when you first join to determine the most appropriate division for you to play in. &nbsp;We reserve the right to deny anyone membership that does not possess the minimum basic skills required in order to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Divisions: <\/b>&nbsp;Men's, Women and Co-ed Triples and doubles at the advanced and open levels<\/p>\n<p><b>Membership:<\/b> Membership is for the entire season only, which runs from November 1st 2015 through May 1st, 2016. &nbsp; Membership fee is $220 which covers access to EAC and the court fees during the allotted Wallyball time. &nbsp;&nbsp;This membership fee is NOT prorated &nbsp;so the best value is to come as early in the season as possible.<\/p>\n<p><b>To encourge you to check the game out before you sign up, notify our leadership team about what day you wish to come and special arrangements with the facility will be made to provide a ONE-TIME ONLY complimentary admission &nbsp;to play. &nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <b>Videos:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73g_9a9tieg&amp;list=PLT55ohxoGKCyO6ERfUG3btQX1wlv3E5BG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73g_9a9tieg...<\/a><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36-sJ5JISwA\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36-sJ5JISwA<\/a> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/highres_444062613.jpeg","photo_id":444062613,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/600_444062613.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/thumb_444062613.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194760862,"name":"George L.

Let's carpool from the Westchester\/Rockland\/Lower Fairfield area for a casual day trip to Windham or Hunter. Let's leave at 9am and get a half-day ticket. Or ski a full day and still leave at 8am! Both ski areas are just over 2 hrs from the Westchester area and provide enough variety on the slope or off the slopes. No need to rush home after a day of skiing.......let's listen to some music in the lodge and relax before heading out. The goal of this group is to have meetups at local Westchester bars so we can meet other ski buddies and arrange carpools so we can all ski together. And also to have a drink or 2! If you're into hanging out at the lodge, thats cool too....no need to be a skier.

The idea of this meetup is an alternative from playing scrabble online. When people play online there is no supervision so you don't know if the game is legitimate or not. The rules: 25:00 in a standard scrabble game for each opponent. If you go over your clock a minute you are penalized ten points even if it is one second. This event will be held at the Greenhouse Cafe at 7717 3rd Ave Brooklyn NY 11209 7-10:30 pm alternate Tuesdays. Directions are the R train to 77th street and walk one block south to third avenue.

At networking events, educational seminars, mastermind groups hosted by business leaders from multiple areas of business you will learn how to grow a 6+ figure business.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9447152,"name":"Frank Coppola","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/f\/7\/b\/highres_251348059.jpeg","photo_id":251348059,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/f\/7\/b\/member_251348059.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/f\/7\/b\/thumb_251348059.jpeg"}},"members":181,"name":"Fearless Entrepreneur New York Meetup","id":19116123,"state":"NY","urlname":"Fearless-Entrepreneur-New-York-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fearless Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447372156000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"adoption","name":"Adoption","id":1777},{"urlkey":"adoptive-parents","name":"Adoptive Parents","id":19550},{"urlkey":"transracial-adoption","name":"Transracial Adoption","id":23144},{"urlkey":"multiracial-adoption","name":"Multiracial Adoption","id":32639},{"urlkey":"adoptive-family-playgroups","name":"Adoptive Family Playgroups","id":32818},{"urlkey":"adoptive-moms","name":"Adoptive Moms","id":41977},{"urlkey":"adoptive-parents-with-young-children","name":"Adoptive Parents With Young Children","id":47151},{"urlkey":"adoption-playgroup","name":"Adoption Playgroup","id":149464}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Adoptive-Family-Playgroups-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone who lives in Manhattan that has adopted a child who is of school age (4-10) who wants to have monthly or bimonthly playdates either in Central Park, East 96th St Library or Playground, or have playdates that seem like fun for everyone involved.

I started this group to help women entrepreneurs be supported by one another, to connect, learn, grow and be in a community that builds confidence to help you step into your power and claim your self-worth so that you can do the work that you love and be of service to others AND be able to financially support yourself and your lifestyle of choice without sacrificing your own wellbeing in the process. Whether you are a long time business owner or just starting out, working for yourself, can be a very lonely and sometimes a little scary. We don't always know all the right things to do and we are often afraid, ashamed or too stubborn to ask for help. By nature, we are passionate, giving, independent and creative. A community of like-minded women going for it in their lives and businesses is a force to be reckoned with. When we take out the competitive mindset and instead trust that there is success for each of us, that rising tide lifts all ships.

National Women's Liberation (NWL) is a new feminist group with old roots. The organization was born from a collaboration between organizers from Redstockings and Gainesville Women's Liberation (FL) which started in 1968. We are a dynamic and diverse group of women in the fight against male supremacy, developing theory alongside our actions. An integral part of our organization is the Women of Color Caucus (WOCC) which meets separately from white women to better understand how white supremacy intersects with other forms of oppression. Our group hosts public meetings the third Tuesday of every month at The Commons at 388 Atlantic Ave, and all women are welcome. <br><\/p>\n<p>NWL won a big victory in 2013 when the Morning-After Pill was put over the counter for all ages, the fruits of a 10-year battle that included a sit-in at the FDA, illegally giving out the pill to show the ridiculousness of the restrictions, and a class action lawsuit. Current priorities are the right to abortion and birth control and the overthrow of the double day--women's roles as full-time caretakers and full time employees. Most recently, we printed and distributed 1969 \"This Oppresses Women\" stickers after reviving them from the Redstockings Archive. We got a lot of publicity when they were used against Protein World's Beach Body ads in Union Square, and they continue to appear on other offending ads all over the city. NWL feminists are also organizing the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign in NYC. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are a group for women who want to fight back against male supremacy and win more freedom for women. We believe that change comes about from the actions of everyday people\u2014not politicians, the courts, lobbyists, or the media. The freedoms we have now were won by movements of women, organizing and fighting for change. Men did not become less sexist or decide to give women the vote or legalize birth control because of our individual abilities to reason with them, educate them, or because they love us so much. The inequalities between women and men are political problems that require a collective solution.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Check out womensliberation.org to get involved. <br><\/p>\n<p>Unless specifically noted, all events are for women only.

This became apparent during our first Zmission. It was truly a humbling and eye-opening experience. As we sat together in fellowship after traveling thousands of miles, we realized that we were there to Serve in any way needed and without judgment. Guidance came in the form of wise council trusting in God and seeking his word. To feel the power of God, let go and trust in him and your life will be transformed.

Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>Zmissions Team <br>Jon Christian \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>God began taping me on the shoulder at an early age. I remember it like it was yesterday. I\u201dd always been naturally rebellious and found it hard to accept what was taught at Sunday school. Sound Familiar? At the age of about 7, I realized there was something missing while sitting in Church services. I felt like God had a bigger plan. A plan for me to SERVE!<\/p>\n<p>Years passed while my searched continued for connection, purpose, and impact until the day my perspective was changed forever\u2026 at my feet written as clear as the day was\u2026\u201dJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d. That was the day I was CALLED SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>I found myself standing on the farthest rock in the ocean I could find. I\u2019d been traveling for miles with 50 lbs. of gear and had not seen my family in two months. As the sun began to set the sky had lit up like fire. The contrast between the blue ocean and the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was as if God himself was staring back at me looking deep within my soul. My hair began to stand up the same way it had when I found \u201cJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d written in concrete so many years before. A voice from within, not the voice you hear from internal conversations you have in your head on a normal day, this was all encompassing vibrating energy coming from both outside and within, it was coming from my heart and the entire world around me. The words spoken to me were \u201cWELL DONE, YOU MADE IT\u2026NOW GO AND TELL THE WORLD.<\/p>\n<p>The adventures and the journey are long, hard, and sometimes painful, but also transformational, rewarding, and have brought much joy and fulfillment in my life. I continue to push my limits, praying \u201cJESUS CHRIST MY LORD AND GOD IN YOU I PUT MY TRUST\u201d Through all the chaos and adventure, and a chance meeting with my Guardian Angel who taught me what unconditional love is I had found what I had been looking for since the age of 7. These experiences have absolutely transformed my life and outlook but most importantly by putting my faith in Jesus and believing he could provide everything and more that we needed I experienced a level of living a life that many only dream about.<\/p>\n<p>Where God lead me next, and the blessings he bestowed on me to this day absolutely blow my mind. Where ever we go, what ever we do, when we get there we do what is needed Period. All you have to do is show up and the big man above will handle the rest. What will you do next? Did you feel it? Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>After a long and sometimes lonely journey, I\u2019ve found wise counsel and fellowship in Christ. Now it\u2019s your turn, we climb this mountain and embark on the adventure together.<\/p>\n<p>John Albino \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>John Albino started Absolute Music Studios with one goal in mind\u2026 to create a warm and inviting musical atmosphere that he himself would want to come to. It all started with the desire to live a more community-oriented life and to be around to raise his children instead of living on the road, which he did for many years. John has worked with musicians from many of the biggest names in the music business over the years, including KISS, The Pretenders, Wings, Billy Joel, Foreigner, Pat Travers and Quiet Riot, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>He has also worked as a studio musician, playing on sessions with many top producers including Stephen Gelfas and Charlie Midnight. <br>Now he has created a first class music studio staffed with the best player-teachers in the area. He brings decades of musical expertise and the benefit of years of front-line professional experience to Absolute Music, his own unique creation. Using that experience as a musician and a vision to guide him, he set out to build a studio where many could come and pursue their passion for music in a warm and inviting family-oriented atmosphere, while being taught by the finest teachers available. Absolute Music is now firmly established as one of the best and busiest music lesson studios in the area. John\u2019s continual dedication to and involvement with the surrounding communities plays a crucial role in his success, while also providing community enrichment through music.<\/p>","lon":-74.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/highres_444267699.jpeg","photo_id":444267699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/600_444267699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/thumb_444267699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192504993,"name":"Jon Christian","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/highres_251458961.jpeg","photo_id":251458961,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/member_251458961.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/thumb_251458961.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Zmissions Christian Adventure Group Hazlet, NJ","id":19129064,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Zmissions-Christian-Adventure-Missions-Meetup-Hazlet-NJ","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.4199981689,"who":"ZMission Warriors For The People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447729458000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"happiness","name":"Happiness","id":16481},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-care","name":"Self-Care","id":27818},{"urlkey":"creating-a-healthy-relationship-to-food","name":"Creating a Healthy Relationship to Food","id":36824},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897},{"urlkey":"mindful-and-intuitive-eating","name":"Mindful and Intuitive Eating","id":118995}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nourish-Mind-and-Body\/","rating":5,"description":"This group provides a safe space to explore how yoga and mindfulness can help make a difference in your life, reduce stress, start living in the present moment and lead to better self-care. I am Diana S. Ramos, a Registered Dietitian\/Nutritionist and yoga instructor. I practice a mind-body approach to nutrition and well-being, and empower each individual to develop a healthy relationship with their bodies, mind and food. My mission is to help individuals thrive into a more joyful, healthy and mindful lives. I discovered the real benefits of yoga in the most difficult times in my life. I was at my peak levels of stress, anxiety and unhappiness. Yoga helped me find peace within myself. Through the practice of yoga I discovered that stress, anxiety and unhappiness were rooted from not living and accepting the present moment. I noticed I was either in living in the past or worrying about the future, but never present moment, in what is. Yoga helped me to kindly move into the present moment, decrease self-judgement, and cultivate self-compassion, self-love and self-acceptance. I would like to share this experience and practice with you. This group offers yoga and wellness workshops, to help you dive into the present moment, release stress and anxiety, and help you to compassionately take care of you. Allow yoga to help you connect with your body. Yoga is not about how flexible you are but how flexible you can become on your mat and in real life with you and your thoughts. Yoga is not about competing, comparing, or judging, it is about self-acceptance, self-love and self-compassion. Yoga is a practice where no experience necessary. The only requirement is you and an open mind. This is an invitation to take care of your body and mind. My Motto: Embrace. Love. Nurture. Embrace who you are. Love yourself just as you are. In order to Nurture yourself the right way.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194388034,"name":"Diana Ramos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/highres_250709693.jpeg","photo_id":250709693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/member_250709693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/thumb_250709693.jpeg"}},"members":131,"name":"Nourish Body & Mind","id":19129142,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nourish-Mind-and-Body","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Body-Mind Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447736862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"productdesign","name":"Product Design","id":2993},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"business-ideas","name":"Business Ideas","id":15928},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"ideas","name":"ideas","id":49075}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Creative-Lab\/","rating":0,"description":"The Creative Lab is a place for people to exercise their creativity.

We want to meet at least once a week, to speak of Jesus Christ and the Scriptures, to pray together, to continue in the apostles teachings and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread.\n\nIt is written, there is one who scatters, yet increases more; and there is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty. This group is to \"scatter\" the word of God, to give free course to the Scriptures. As long as we are willing to rightly divide the word of truth, every man and woman has a part in the conversation. We can edify each other in love. I put one block of truth, and you can put another block of truth.\n\nYou can expect to be part of a spiritual conversation, and the opportunity to exercise your spiritual gifts as long as we do all things decently and in order. When we come together, every single member has. One has a psalm, another a doctrine, someone else a tongue, another one a revelation, the next man an interpretation. Let all things be done for edifying of the body of Christ.\n\nThe Gospel\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God unto the meek, liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, the proclamation of the day of salvation, the acceptable year of the Lord (Isa 52:6-7, 61:1-2, Luk 4:18-19, 8:1); whereby God sent and anointed his son Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel and to be the saviour of the world. (1 Jn 4:14) The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes whether Jew or Greek (Rom 1:16-17) to all them that call upon him (Rom 10:12-15). For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  The Gospel declares that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, he was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures, that he was seen of Cephas, the twelve and then of five hundred brethren at once. (1 Cor 15:1-3) Through the Gospel we understand that that the stone which was rejected is become the head of the corner.  Jesus Christ who was rejected and crucified rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and is now exalted far above all principalities and powers (Ps 118:22-23, Mat 21:42, Acts 4:10-12, 1 Cor 15:1-3, Eph 1:20-21). This tried stone is none other than Jesus Christ; whose name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isa 7:10-14, Mat 1:21-23; Is 8:10-18, 9:6-7; 1 Pet 2:4-8). This is the true God and eternal life (1 Jn 5:20).\n\nAn essential part of the gospel is understanding what it means that Jesus is the Christ.  It is written, that He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God did not give the Spirit by measure unto Him (Jn 3:34). This verse speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, a body that God prepared, so that the fullness of the Father would be manifested in him (Heb 10:5). As the Scripture says, For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col 1:19).  This is the mystery of Christ, even the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory (1Ti 3:16). He that sees Jesus, sees Him that sent him (Jn 12:45). This is to the mind that has understanding. The name of the Father is Jesus. The name of the Son is Jesus. The name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus. These are spiritual words, and they owe to be discerned spiritually. This is what Jesus meant, when he said that he was the Son of God. For since the very beginning it was written, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness (Gen 1:16). Jesus Christ is that man, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature (Col 1:15). God was in Christ, and not another. I repeat again, Christ received the Spirit of God without measure. The prophet Isaiah foresaw this and speaking as the oracles of God wrote that a child will be born unto us, that a son will be given. And that his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father. We are also called to be partakers of such fullness, to come in the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to grow unto that perfect man, unto the measure and stature of Christ (Eph 4:13). We are also called to receive the Spirit of Christ. God will give us the Holy Ghost if we obey Him (Acts 5:32). Men and brethren, what must we do in order to obey God?\n\nJesus Christ came preaching repentance and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat 4:17). In order to enter into the kingdom of God we must be born again of the water and of the Spirit (Jn 3:3-5). Those early disciples in the book of Acts were born again when they repented, were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (born of the water), and received the infilling of the Holy Ghost (born of the Spirit). (Acts 2:37-41, 8:12-17, 9:17-18, 10:44-48, 19:1-6) The baptisms in the book of Acts were done in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 4:12, 8:12, 10:48, 19:5, Gal 3:27, Rom 6:3-4, Col 2:12). In order to obey the Gospel and enter into the kingdom of God we too must do what those early disciples did and what Jesus commanded. Repent therefore, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you too shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38-39). Please take the time to look up the scriptures listed in this study (Acts 17:11).","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/highres_445157812.jpeg","photo_id":445157812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/600_445157812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_445157812.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":182770744,"name":"Andy Rodriguez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/highres_254063837.jpeg","photo_id":254063837,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/member_254063837.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/thumb_254063837.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"Church In Manhattan","id":19136615,"state":"NY","urlname":"Church-In-Manhattan","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Christians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447943628000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"motion-graphics","name":"Motion Graphics","id":19344},{"urlkey":"final-cut-pro","name":"Final Cut Pro","id":19965},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"3d-animation","name":"3D Animation","id":25718},{"urlkey":"compositing","name":"Compositing","id":29130},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"vfx","name":"VFX","id":30988},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"post-production-editing-visual-effects-vfx","name":"POST-PRODUCTION: EDITING & Visual Effects VFX","id":468552},{"urlkey":"video-and-computer-animation","name":"Video and computer animation","id":1162242},{"urlkey":"animation-and-visual-effects","name":"Animation and visual effects","id":1250832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/postproductionworkshops\/","rating":0,"description":"Live workshops and user group meetings on making workflow with FCPX, DaVinci Resolve, Fusion, Smoke and a bunch of other stuff.

Many are still scratching their heads: asking why why such an awkward silly wannabe-- sorry- excuse- for- D\/s erotica created such a stir.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Exhibit A:<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>She Said~<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dude, I would watch that show. But no joke the tone was more spastic than a herd of gerbils hopped up on crystal meth flipping from dark drama to more light-hearted comedic fare and back again (not to mention&nbsp;stalking is the new black; all the cool billionaire sadists are doing it). Even die-hard fans were laughing along with me at some of the more melodramatic fails in the film and the mother-daughter duo to my right (because nothing says family bonding than bondage porn) were less-than-blown-away saying to each other after the credits rolled \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t that bad\u201d and \u201cit kind of grew on you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still a better idea than watching&nbsp;Fifty&nbsp;Shades.Verdict <\/p>\n<p><b>He Said~<\/b><\/p>\n<p>An insufferably stupid erotic film. Any author or screenwriter at the end of their rope because they know that they\u2019ll never be good enough to be published or produced, can use Fifty Shades of Grey to know they are good enough.&nbsp;You are good enough, writer! Even if you suck, which you might if your self-esteem is that low, you can know that since something like this has been released to the masses, you have hope. And even if you do get rejected by everyone, at least you can know that your boo probably loves you. And if your relationship is even creepier than the one portrayed here, at least one of you probably has some sort of personality. And if you\u2019re single, at least you have alcohol.<\/p>\n<p><b>We think the better question is what does this global craze say about the void that exist?<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this tragic attempt at erotic art has been bashed to pieces--one thing is clear. There's a lot of curiosity about fet-alt erotica. Obviously-- vanilla erotica is limited, uninspiring or perhaps just plain boring to millions of women and even men around the world. It's sad to contemplate so many kinksters all dressed up with no place to go.

What if you could upgrade your thoughts, feelings,habits and future like the apps on your tablet or smartphone? Are you stuck and can't get your life moving faster. What if there are NEW methods to RESET your life like when your smartphone freezes. \"UPGRADE And RESET YOUR LIFE\" provides tools that will make you happier, more passionate about life, more productive on your dreams, and wealthier. We will get you to \"do life\" and not just learn \"about\" it. You will make discoveries about yourself, stop negative thoughts, develop better habits, evolve beyond your wildest dreams. Each session you will practical cognitive tools to immediately take your life to the next level. <br>This is Not the lecture format you have seen and done many times in the past, there are better ways to learn and gain rapid results.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Forming A Community Of Shared \"Specific Mind\" Practices&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our mission is to build a wide community of friends, family, and coworkers using New-art and other tools together during meetup sessions and in their daily lives. <br>What makes this different from anything else in the world, is each member will work on their \"Specific Mind.\" For the first time ever people interested in self-improvement will work on their \"Specific Mind\" instead of an abstract philosophy of how people should work. <br> There are tools that can effect both emotions and habits. Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, take measurements of habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile. We will take abstract concepts and transform them through the knowledge of neural science and physics into powerful physical tools you can touch.

New Art will allow each person to understand their own \"Specific-Mind\" like a MRI for the mind. The primary emphasis of New Art is developing self-awareness and choices. It becomes easy to literally see your limitations and problems while also seeing powerful solutions no other tools can provide. You will enhance the best of yourself while upgrading your life in ways beyond your dreams. Join this group to start UPGRADING YOUR LIFE each week. You will have fun while making real changes in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each Session members will hold in their hands printed sheets of Art work they will use to record parts of their minds, solve problems, communicate with their minds (different from meditation), record measurements of mental activity. With the Art Work members of the community will be able to show each others what they are working on each week.

Events are limited to 4 photographers. Most models seem to prefer 3 photographers. Those events with more than 4 are called paparazzi shoot-outs, they typically cost less. Some events are meet and greets or promotional events.<\/p>\n<p>The models chosen to be on the team have been interviewed and have passed a series of criteria to participate. These models are professional and work well beyond the time behind the camera: They scout locations, contact venues, determine if permits are required or not and obtain them if feasible. Some events require they rent wardrobe or equipment and it doesn't need to be explained that there is a great deal of time doing all of that. This group nor the models do any TFPs... Ever. What's nice is the photographers never have to spend any time editing, copying or distributing pictures to models. That's right. Photographers are not obligated to share their pictures nor are the models expecting any from them.

This is a music group with performances by live vocal groups, bands, solo artists and other music based art, in rare cases of DJs spinning on a turntable. The music can range from R and B, Pop, Rock and Roll, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Reggae, Calypso, Soca, Merengue, Afro-Cuban, Reggaeton and anything else in between. Some events are local in New York City and New Jersey with dinner while others are day trip events with buses commuting from the five boroughs to dinner halls then concerts halls. Some live artist who participate are well known and others are up and coming. Some are events with 70's, 80's or 90's themes while others presenting the current styles of music. Some are live shows with artist and other are dancing events. These are usually free or low cost events that are sponsored by The Making A Difference with Morinda Organization which focuses on charity, health and fitness. So some events may include a short sponsorship presentation or venue advertisement of maintaining and living in better health from a sponsor representative for 30 minutes prior to a show.

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. In 2014 BNI members passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business. Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 20+ (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 20+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Tuesdays at 7:00AM at Junior's) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?! Current Location: Junior's 386 Flatbush Ave Ext Brooklyn, NY 11201 Cost: $20\/visitor The meeting starts at 7:00am and is officially over at 8:30am. You will need to bring 50+ business cards to pass to everyone in the room. You will also need to be prepared to tell the room who you are, what you do, and who a perfect referral for you would be. The more specific you are in asking for the referral the greater chance you have in receiving that life changing referral on the spot.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/highres_444800198.jpeg","photo_id":444800198,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/600_444800198.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/thumb_444800198.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":196314630,"name":"Revenue Raisers","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/highres_251811307.jpeg","photo_id":251811307,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/member_251811307.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/thumb_251811307.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"BNI Revenue Raisers, Brooklyn NY","id":19173196,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Revenue-Raisers-Brooklyn-NY","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449036248000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"interracial","name":"Interracial Families","id":1861},{"urlkey":"food-tasting","name":"Food Tasting","id":17132},{"urlkey":"brunch","name":"Brunch","id":18239},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"kid-friendly-activities","name":"Kid Friendly Activities","id":26453},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"home-cooking","name":"Home Cooking","id":32289},{"urlkey":"cooking-at-home","name":"Cooking at Home","id":73417},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Umi-Family\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We'll be holding regular community potlucks celebrating culinary entrepreneurship mainly in the Brooklyn community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Umi is a platform for culinary entrepreneurship and a marketplace for home cooking.

Circles happen on or near the evening of the new moon because this is the best time, astrologically, to plant seeds for what we long to manifest in our lives and for the world. Setting intentions with a group is a powerful practice because it allows your dreams and longings to be witnessed and supported by others. It also holds you accountable to taking the necessary action, internally and externally, to manifest your longings. While every circle has a different theme, there in always meditation, group sharing (optional), and the writing and speaking of individual intentions. Circles may also incorporate aspects of spiritual ceremony and ritual; however, it is not religious and open to women of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths. Allow yourself to be supported by the heavens and held in the energies of the Divine Feminine as you make space for new awareness, transformation, and manifestation.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/b\/1\/highres_444725809.jpeg","photo_id":444725809,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/b\/1\/600_444725809.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/b\/1\/thumb_444725809.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7950034,"name":"jen","photo":{"photo_id":208730032,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/7\/0\/member_208730032.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/7\/0\/thumb_208730032.jpeg"}},"members":311,"name":"Manhattan Women's Circle","id":19176656,"state":"NY","urlname":"Manhattan-Womens-Circle","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449104043000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sap","name":"SAP Professional","id":460},{"urlkey":"erp","name":"Enterprise Resource Planning","id":9900},{"urlkey":"business-management","name":"Business Management","id":21090},{"urlkey":"business-process-management","name":"Business Process Management","id":49337},{"urlkey":"sap-enterprise-solutions","name":"SAP Enterprise Solutions","id":82034},{"urlkey":"erp-software","name":"ERP Software","id":138507},{"urlkey":"erp-consulting","name":"ERP Consulting","id":389791},{"urlkey":"business-process-management-systems","name":"Business Process Management Systems","id":889252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-ERP-Software-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Join a group of knowledgeable individuals looking to: \n- Stay on top of current software trends\n- Absorb presentations by industry professionals\n- Network with your peers","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":53303112,"name":"Samuel Friedman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/1\/d\/highres_251838717.jpeg","photo_id":251838717,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/1\/d\/member_251838717.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/1\/d\/thumb_251838717.jpeg"}},"members":27,"name":"New York ERP Software Meetup","id":19176684,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-ERP-Software-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Business Software Professionals"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449113558000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"beer","name":"Beer","id":1475},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"beer-lovers","name":"Beer Lovers","id":46593},{"urlkey":"beer-and-food","name":"Beer and Food","id":84291},{"urlkey":"beer-drinkning","name":"Beer drinkning","id":166067}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Beer-Runners\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>If you enjoy running, libations, exploring new bars in Brooklyn and meeting new people, we are the group for you!

Our meetup is $25.00 per person and there is limited space, so we are keeping it to a smaller group to begin with, but will move into a larger space as the meetup grows!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/highres_444776117.jpeg","photo_id":444776117,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/600_444776117.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/thumb_444776117.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":66853322,"name":"Susana Vilmer","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/highres_251898005.jpeg","photo_id":251898005,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/member_251898005.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/thumb_251898005.jpeg"}},"members":444,"name":"Women's Law of Attraction Self-Empowerment Meetup","id":19184494,"state":"NY","urlname":"womenlawofattraction","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Empowered Women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Rochelle","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449335102000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Book-Club-Moms-Westchester\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi there. I'm a new stay-at-home mom in the Westchester area looking to meet other moms with infants.

So why don't we try to get together after the holidays in early 2016 and start our own? Moms AND babies will be welcome (expecting moms too, of course!), and don't put too much pressure on yourself if you can't finish the assigned books. I'll try to pick some with Audible recordings (GREAT service to use while at home with a little one) and even movies so that those of us with limited time can still join in discussion. And hey, if you don't get to the book at all, that's ok -- this is about meeting other moms and their kids through a fun activity.<br><br>Our first meetup will be scheduled on a weekday -- If there's enough interest we can also start meeting over the weekends to make it easier on working moms.<br><\/p>","lon":-73.7900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/highres_447718021.jpeg","photo_id":447718021,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/600_447718021.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/thumb_447718021.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":75113672,"name":"Renee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/highres_251972308.jpeg","photo_id":251972308,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/member_251972308.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/thumb_251972308.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Westchester Book Club for New Moms","id":19184531,"state":"NY","urlname":"Book-Club-Moms-Westchester","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Book Club Moms"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449351321000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"casino","name":"Casino Games","id":2965},{"urlkey":"shopping","name":"Shopping","id":9349},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"day-trips","name":"Day Trips","id":20423},{"urlkey":"tours","name":"Tours","id":20754},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"bus-trips","name":"Bus Trips","id":35476},{"urlkey":"historical-tours","name":"Historical Tours","id":73281}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Bus-Tours-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Our club will run&nbsp;<strong><em>BUS TRIPS<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; to fun and exciting places.&nbsp; Some of our meet-ups will be Shows, casinos, fairs, History trips, Flower shows, Lancaster Boston and other great places.&nbsp; The bus will leave from<\/p>\n<p>Bay Ridge Brooklyn and 34th and 6th Ave NYC<\/p>\n<p>We will also offer a stop if requested on AVE U and Coney Island AVE<\/p>\n<p>We will also plan meet-ups in Brooklyn and talk about future trips.<\/p>\n<p>This club will be a great way of meeting new people and friends&nbsp;that love to travel.<\/p>\n<p>The more members we get the more trips&nbsp; we will run.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/d\/a\/highres_448851674.jpeg","photo_id":448851674,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/d\/a\/600_448851674.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/d\/a\/thumb_448851674.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190568027,"name":"Philip Brown","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/highres_252019473.jpeg","photo_id":252019473,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/member_252019473.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/thumb_252019473.jpeg"}},"members":197,"name":"Travel Friends Bus Tour Club","id":19185111,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Bus-Tours-Meetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449362037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"bipolar","name":"Bipolar Disorder","id":892},{"urlkey":"life-management-systems-for-bipolar-disorder","name":"Life Management Systems for Bipolar Disorder","id":21491},{"urlkey":"mental-illness-awareness","name":"Mental Illness Awareness","id":55711},{"urlkey":"bipolar-and-depression","name":"Bipolar and Depression","id":60508},{"urlkey":"bipolar-support-group","name":"Bipolar Support Group","id":115297},{"urlkey":"managing-bipolar","name":"managing bipolar","id":156356},{"urlkey":"bipolar-group","name":"Bipolar Group","id":768272}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mental-Health-Mystics\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Who says that our thoughts are out of line?

Being single can do that to you, and it's not good for my waistline or my budget. We can meetup at my place (I have a large dining room and kitchen) and divide whatever meals people bring into tupperwares, taking home nice portions to eat through-out the week. One of the main reasons I don't like cooking as a single woman is leftovers... I'm not a fan... so this kind of takes care of that problem. Instead of eating the same meal 7 nights in a row, we can have 7 or more people come and eat a different meal each night of the week! My apartment has a very spacious living room, dining room and kitchen. It's best we prepare food at our own places, but if needed, we can do some meal prep at my place too. I have a slow cooker, rice cooker, deep fryer and every other cooking gadget imaginable. I'm no longer a vegetarian, so I'm open to meals of any kind. Healthy is nice though.

We gather in a safe, relaxed setting to discuss death, celebrate life, and drink tea (or coffee), and eat delicious cake together. Not morbid at all!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Death Caf\u00e9 was started in 2011 by Jon Underwood and based on the work of Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz. Bernard offered \"Caf\u00e9 Mortels\" in Switzerland and France. Jon read of this in a newspaper article in November 2010. Jon was already developing a project to get people talking about death and immediately knew that Bernard\u2019s vision clicked with his. Fast forward to July 2012, when Lizzy Miles brought Death Caf\u00e9 to the US in Columbus, Ohio. Today there are more than 2600 Death Caf\u00e9s held globally\u2026won't you be part of this growing movement? Our Death Caf\u00e9 welcomes, and is open to the community. We have no intention of leading people to any conclusion, product or course of action\u2026just deep conversation and cake!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is limited seating so please RSVP.

training and admonition of The Lord. I started this group to establish a gathering that caters to raising godly children. It is so important for us to learn, teach, and demonstrate virtues (moral excellence) to our little ones. Meet-ups involve one or more of the following: &nbsp;prayer, bible reading\/teaching, goal-setting for our children,&nbsp;teaching colors, numbers, ABC's, teaching textures, shapes, and sizes, scripture memory, outdoor exploring, learning through nature, arts and crafts, health and fitness introduction, library meet-ups, discussions. My hope is to unite people committed to raising godly children, and for us to all grow as we seek direction from God. Let us get together and see what the Lord has in store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are especially welcome to this group if you have realized that parenting is more than you can handle on your own. &nbsp;You are especially welcome to this group If you have some relational issues that have not been resolved and you know it is affecting your parenting. &nbsp;You are especially welcome if you don't know where you stand with God. &nbsp;Everyone is in a different place in life and God knows it already. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There will be many resources shared during our meet-ups to coach us and help us along the parenting journey. &nbsp;So come on in and stay awhile.<\/p>","lon":-73.8899993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":28693232,"name":"Elle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/highres_251998184.jpeg","photo_id":251998184,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/member_251998184.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/thumb_251998184.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Raising Children to Love The Lord and Love People He Created","id":19197308,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yonkers-Christian-Kids-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Everyone"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449673014000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"private-lending","name":"Private Lending","id":30026},{"urlkey":"private-money-lending","name":"Private Money Lending","id":154505},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-lending","name":"Peer-to-Peer Lending","id":298291},{"urlkey":"sharing-economy","name":"sharing economy","id":918902},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-economy","name":"Peer to Peer Economy","id":1173472},{"urlkey":"online-lending","name":"Online lending","id":1506119}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/P2P-and-Marketplace-Lending-Operators\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>* Who should join: People with general interest in p2p and marketplace lending should join.

That is if we even care about how we dress.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that how we present ourselves has a huge impact in our dating lives, in our ability to land a great job and in how people perceive us overall.

The mission of this group is to get <b>divorcees,<\/b> single parents and children out interacting with each other for fun, humor, laughs, camaraderie, support and friendship, and to enhance lives in the process. Few members that we have, often describe that the relationships forged in this group are often deep and rich.

Most members describe the group as \u201cfamily.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We try to run this group in a very professional, non-judgmental (\u201cDon\u2019t judge others because they sin differently than you do.\u201d), and impartial manner (avoiding conflict of interest, if any) \u2013 \u201cNirbhay Nirvaer\u201d. It is extremely important to maintain high degree of integrity and respect for each other. We expect that members will follow through on their commitments to attend an event when they RSVP \u201cYes.\u201d Chronic no-shows or late cancellations may result in removal from the group.

We provide a unique and amazing opportunity for support and friendship. It is only possible by the efforts of the all-volunteer organizers and event hosts. Please show your appreciation to our volunteers who put out the time, effort (and sometimes their own money) to organize and host wonderful events, and come up with amazing ideas to post these events. Sometimes a simple thank-you can make the effort worthwhile.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d love for you to host an event, too! If you would like to host an event, please contact us to indicate that you are interested in becoming an event organizer of the group. Once you are made an event-organizer, you can then create your own events without asking anyone to create one for you.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you so much for joining now your group :).

We are committed to ending patriarchy, not in achieving \u201cequality\u201d within patriarchy.
