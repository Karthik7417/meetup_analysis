This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.

Calliope, the photographer\u2019s muse, is captured using this unusual type of photography - allowing for the viewer to transcend into an ethereal otherworldliness.<\/p> <p>Other works included in this show at the General Consulate of Germany show her continued love of structure, architecture and reflective light. In the\u00a0Palais Lichtenau Enfilades\u00a0the viewer is enticed to step through the image into another world.

I am eager to do more!\u00a0Anna Bartos is knowledgeable about a broad range of musical styles and genres, acting and character development as well as singing.\u00a0I would definitely like to perform in this type of event again.

Come on out and sip cocktails, mingle and paint a great canvas under the guidance of a master artist! During the 2 and a half hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash bar. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails. We have a fun little ice breaker game that helps everyone get to meet each other where you'll get raffle tickets for a chance to win a prize! Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone). Typically about 75% of attendees of this event come alone and 25% bring friends. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<\/p> <p>Oh - here's a quick note to the men. Guys... this event has been called, \"A secret gem. One of the best places to meet fun, quality women in NYC\". So fellas, if you really want to meet a great woman, ditch the online dating scene and head on out to one of our painting nights!<\/p> <p>* This is a multi-Meetup group event.

Are you committed (like me), to getting hired as an actor? One of the essential tools we need to keep sharp is: great monologues. To keep our monologues fresh and kick-ass, I'm creating this meetup so we can practice with each other and be ready when opportunity knocks. Everyone will have a chance to perform at least one (two minute) monologue. Then, your peers (us) will give you feedback \/ suggested adjustments. Take 'em or leave 'em. Then you perform it again. Depending on turnout, we may each do this again with a second monologue. Unless someone has access to free professional space, I will rent space at one of the NY rehearsal studios - in which case, there'll be a small fee to cover the rental space (divide cost of space by number of attendees). So - location TBA. If successful, I'd very much like to do this regularly. So - who's in?

That being said, if you have any friends that you've been trying to convince to join you for a run with TMIRCE but they aren't feeling ready, this is a great place to get them started!

And we\u2019re told that in order to fix what\u2019s broken, we need to narrow our curricula, standardize our classrooms, and find news ways to measure students and teachers. But what if these \u201cfixes\u201d are making our schools worse.In Beyond Measure, we set out to challenge the assumptions of our current education story.<\/p> <p>Rather than ask why our students fail to measure up, this film asks us to reconsider the greater purpose of education. What if our education system valued personal growth over test scores? Put inquiry over mimicry? Encouraged passion over rankings? What if we decided that the higher aim of school was not the transmission of facts or formulas, but the transformation of every student? And what if this paradigm-shift was driven from the ground up? By students, parents, and educators? By all of us?<\/p> <p>In Beyond Measure, we find a revolution brewing in public schools across the country. From rural Kentucky to New York City, schools that are breaking away from an outmoded, test-driven education are shaping a new vision for our classrooms. These are schools that see critical thinking, communication, exploration, experimentation, collaboration, and creativity as the key to good education. And they are dramatically improving outcomes for children of all backgrounds. They are schools where practically every student graduates and goes on to finish college.<\/p> <p>Beyond Measure offers a positive picture of what\u2019s possible in American education when communities decide they are ready for change.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/226352880\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Each Thurs. from 7-9pm  Happiness and Goodness at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"krgdllytpbhb","time":1446768000000,"updated":1446802324000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"107 Grand Strett","name":"Percolate","lon":-74.001373,"id":24173437,"state":"NY","lat":40.720985,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.09575605392,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445883462000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>On Thursday, November 5th, Percolate is hosting a portfolio review for Graphic Designers, Art Directors, Copywriters and Film Makers.

Come on out and sip cocktails, mingle and paint a great canvas under the guidance of a master artist! During the 2 and a half hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash bar. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails. We have a fun little ice breaker game that helps everyone get to meet each other where you'll get raffle tickets for a chance to win a prize! Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone). Typically about 75% of attendees of this event come alone and 25% bring friends. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<\/p> <p>Oh - here's a quick note to the men. Guys... this event has been called, \"A secret gem. One of the best places to meet fun, quality women in NYC\". So fellas, if you really want to meet a great woman, ditch the online dating scene and head on out to one of our painting nights!<\/p> <p>* This is a multi-Meetup group event.

Bob or Jeff are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Tell the desk you're there for water polo.

We will start at the N.J. Transit Station in Cranford and finish at the N.J. Transit Station in Somerville (Somerset County). This walk through central New Jersey will closely parallel the \"Raritan Valley\" Line, which has weekend service from Penn Station in Newark. Walk the entire distance or return to Penn Station from any of the train stations along the way- Westfield, Fanwood, Plainfield, Dunellen, Bound Brook or Bridgewater. Eastbound trains depart hourly from most of these stations to Newark's Penn Station on weekends. For additional information and schedules, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njtransit.com\">www.njtransit.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Although most of the miles we walk will be on level, paved suburban streets and sidewalks, we will walk through a few parks along the way. There will be plenty of food and drink options along the route, but everyone should bring at least one bottle of water and a few snacks or energy bars. Comfortable walking shoes, sneakers or light hiking shoes are recommended.

We turn back after running 30 min to be back at 9 am. Hyatt pier is .31 miles so a double loop gets some runners 6.5 miles on this run.<\/p> <p>9 am we run to Liberty State Park, a favorite place to run for most of us.

What if the new home-owner was outside watering his or her lawn, or just waiting with his or her child for the school bus? Would you go and talk to them? I would.

This event will inspire you, take you to levels you've never been before.<\/p> <p>Through the Critical Home Repair Program (CHR) we will help with necessary repairs on homes affected by Superstorm Sandy.

THE CREDIT SENSE DIFFERENCE. CreditSense tackles the\u00a0800 pound gorilla of the credit system\u00a0by helping consumers and business professionals to achieve Tier 1 or even 800+ credit scores. CreditSense offers powerful, proven strategies to not only recover lost points due to bad credit, but to optimize our clients' credit profiles so that every piece of data measured by FICO scoring software produces the maximum number of credit score points for them. In this presentation Merrill will show you how to optimize your credit and get you on the path to a Tier 1 or even 800+ credit score.\u00a0About Credit Sense:<\/p> <p>Every credit repair company in the country does the same thing. They send a letter to the credit bureaus that says the\u00a0problem account is not yours, or not actually late. They have no proof or research behind what they say, kind of like pointing\u00a0your finger in the dark. They give you a SINGLE POINT of credit inspection.<\/p> <p>And what if you don't have bad credit but you still want a higher score?<\/p> <p>At CreditSense we do things different.\u00a0We know that there is a perfect credit profile that always delivers an 800+ credit score. (round hole) Your credit profile is\u00a0probably NOT perfect (square peg). We bring your credit profile into alignment with that perfect profile.\u00a0The result: YOU get a Tier 1 or even an 800+ credit score\u2014guaranteed!<\/p> <p>How do we do it?\u00a0Instead of a one-point inspection, we do a 40-point inspection of every facet of your credit profile looking for factual errors, inconsistencies, and drags on your score\u2014and we fix and optimize them!\u00a0CreditSense does REAL research and checks what is dragging your score down, then has your creditors and the bureaus correct them.<\/p> <p>SPECIAL INFORMATION JUST FOR REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS!<\/p> <p>\u00a0** OUR\u00a0FREE\u00a0EXPO HAS TONS OF VALUABLE\u00a0<\/p> <p>INFORMATION * MINGLE WITH VENDORS **<\/p> <p>NON-STOP NETWORKING!<\/p> <p>Please bring plenty of business cards.<\/p> <p>Meet with Private Lenders<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0** Speakers may vary due to schedule conflicts **<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0Learn About Our NEW MONTHLY online-only magazine<\/b><\/p> <p>LEARN ABOUT OUR ONLINE-ONLY REI WEALTH MAGAZINE!\u00a0The newest addition to our Realty411 media company is here EVERY MONTH giving you the latest news and information in a\u00a0NEW AGE ERA, learn about this new issue here.<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/evbdn.eventbrite.com\/s3-s3\/eventlogos\/16354607\/croppedblogheader2.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0* Realty411's CEO\/Publisher *<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/evbdn.eventbrite.com\/s3-s3\/eventlogos\/16354607\/1551698101521719021889451560387978n.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Realty411\u00a0is jam-packed with fantastic tips, techniques, and information that can help you create abundance in real estate, just as we have.

He presents 4 major steps of problem-solving along with specific strategies and heuristics to attempt to apply. He also reflects on the role of a teacher in helping students build problem solving skills.<\/p> <p>This session will present P\u00f3lya's work reframed for the context of computer science and proposes the 4 Steps as a conceptual model for both students and teachers to reflect on their own problem solving processes.<\/p> <p>Computer Science and computational thinking are very much about problem solving. Experienced computer scientists have an implicit toolkit of approaches they use when facing a new problem. New learners often lack that toolkit. Attendees will walk away from the workshop with an extensive set of Question Stems aligned to each of the 4 Steps that can immediately be put into practice in the classroom.<\/p> <p>Nathaniel is Regional Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tealsk12.org\/\">TEALS<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Lionel Bergeron + Alana Aaron - Engaging All Learners in Computer Science<br\/><\/b>In 2013 Code.org initiated a worldwide interest in computer programming through the Hour of Code. In an effort to continue to engage students, especially in the elementary grades, they developed Computer Science Fundamentals. The courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with \u201cunplugged\u201d activities that require no computers at all. This workshop will look at how these unplugged activities can be used to engage all learners, no matter what the age or academic level. In addition, we will explore how the curriculum\u2019s Play Lab allows students to explore their own interest and ideas through creative programming. The most important takeaways from the presentation will be that participants will be able to identify how unplugged activities can enhance computer science content, how much the play factor can impact student performance and how to approach other lessons to engage all learners.<\/p> <p>Alana is a 5th grade teacher in Washington Heights and Lionel is a Technology Coach for D75, NYC's Special Education District.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Christine Keefe + Glenn Durfee - Using Parson's Problems to Teach AP CS <\/b><br\/>Parson's Problems ask students to put code statements in the correct order to solve a problem. They are a fun and efficient way to assess student learning of higher level learning objectives. They\u00a0are \"scrambled code puzzles\", and consist of a complete sample of well-written code presented in a random order. When properly written, Parson's problems allow instructors to identify what students don't know in syntax and logic.<\/p> <p>Attendees will learn the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of using Parson's-type problems in teaching and assessing AP Computer Science. Attendees will be able to: 1) Explain how a parsons problem can be used to tease apart errors in syntax, logic, or both, and 2) Demonstrate how to tier a parsons problem to accommodate for different learners.<\/p> <p>Christine and Glenn are rockstar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tealsk12.org\/\">TEALS<\/a> volunteers.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Gordon Smith - Not so Standard: 5-9th Grade Coding Standards <\/b><br\/>As the CSTA begins their comprehensive review and revision of their K-12 CS Standards, we thought it was a good time to have a discussion about teaching CS in 5th to 9th grade.<br\/>Our vision is for standards that are specific enough to assess the efficacy of CS teaching and curriculum, yet at the same time broad enough to encompass coding, physical computing, and robotics. Well constructed standards will help ensure that we, as CS educators, are working towards common goals and have a framework for ensuring that we are preparing students for high school, college, career, and life-long learning opportunities in CS.<\/p> <p>We will discuss the existing CSTA standards and the standards we are developing to guide our curriculum at Codesters. We will also facilitate an open discussion among participants to help broaden and deepen a common set of standards and how to use standards to guide teaching pedagogy and assessment. The participant discussion will focus on how to make appropriate grade-level standards that prepare students for high school level standards (i.e. APCSP) and beyond. We will also discuss the purpose of CS education and how that defines what success means for students. Participants will also learn what standards are currently being used in middle grades and gain insight on selecting standards for their classroom. Attendees will also have the opportunity to share their own expertise about what belongs in a comprehensive set of standards for CS in the middle grades.<\/p> <p>Gordon is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codesters.com\/\">Codesters<\/a>.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CSNYC-Education-Meetup\/events\/225901979\/","yes_rsvp_count":72,"duration":16200000,"name":"CS Pedagogy Meetup - Nov 2015 Edition","id":"225901979","time":1446906600000,"updated":1446932364000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1382060425000,"name":"CSNYC Education Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10736002,"urlname":"CSNYC-Education-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"CS Folk"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"River Edge","address_1":"18 Lakeview Street","name":"Soul Practice Yoga hOMe Studio ","lon":-74.04024,"id":23902547,"lat":40.912518,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.555521965,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445972697000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bringing our Saturday outdoor yoga practice in.

(That's right folks - I'm bringing the webbing!)<\/p> <p>Finally we will complete our hike through dense hemlock forest and over streams as we marvel at the crags and crevasses of the Shawangunk Ridge.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/c\/600_440824460.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>WHERE TO MEET?<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/41%C2%B043%2743.9%22N+74%C2%B014%2714.1%22W\/@41.7284176,-74.2367183,298m\/data=%213m1%211e3%214m2%213m1%211s0x0:0x0\">WE WILL START AT THE UPPER PARKING AREA ADJACENT TO LAKE MINNEWASKA ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRANCE GATE.<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0 approx 8 miles<\/p> <p><b>Hiking Pace:<\/b>\u00a0 Up to 2.0 mph - In the Crevices it will be Slow but physically challenging<\/p> <p><b>Estimated Hike Time:<\/b>\u00a0 7 hours<\/p> <p><b>Difficulty:<\/b>\u00a0 Advanced Beginner\/Intermediate - Rocky Terrain and Crevices with possible exposures - I will bring a 50 ft. handline to help navigate any hard terrain.<\/p> <p><b>Current Weather Forecast:<\/b> Cloudy with a high of 61 Degrees\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Fee:<\/b> $10. per car<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/7\/7\/600_440824471.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>RECOMMENDED GEAR:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>\u2022<\/b> <b>Raincoat\/Windbreaker<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Hiking Poles<\/b> (if desired)<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 \"Scrambling\" Gloves<\/b> - Lightweight with good grip - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/West-Chester-Latex-Gripper-Knit-Glove-HD30501-SHSP36\/100398993?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-100398989-_-100398993-_-N\">Gardening gloves from Home Depot work great!<\/a><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Shoes with good grip<\/b> - preferably with ankle support<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Headlamp with spare batteries<\/b> - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/t\/202968174?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=rayovac&amp;storeId=10051&amp;N=5yc1v&amp;R=202968174#.UWDkcVfzBQg\">Home Depot has a great 100 lumen headlamp for only $12.99!<\/a><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 A Small Pack<\/b> - nothing too large that will become a hindrance in the scrambles<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Related maps<\/b>, a <b>Compass<\/b> or <b>GPS<\/b>, <b>Water<\/b>, <b>Snacks<\/b>, <b>First Aid<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/a\/b\/600_440824523.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/c\/c\/600_440824556.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>RELATED MAPS:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nynjtc.org\/product\/shawangunk-trails\">New York - New Jersey Trail Conference - Shawangunk Trails Map Set<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/b\/e\/600_440824542.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/e\/0\/600_440824576.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Afterwards feel free to join us at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Bacchus+Restaurant\/@41.747242,-74.086799,191m\/data=%213m2%211e3%214b1%214m2%213m1%211s0x89dd22784c20f64f:0x8ad9c6478aeef3b1\">Bacchus Restaurant, Bar &amp; Billiards<\/a> for some great food\/drinks &amp; maybe even a game of Pool!

Standing in the center of the new York City but it`s neighborhood is pretty quiet and not crowded. Here, every room is has unique interior.\u00a0 Waldorf \u2013Astoria was the first hotel that offered room service and kids menu. These two options changed the hotel industry forever. Surprisingly, there is a hidden train stop underneath the Waldoft-Astoria. President Franklin Roosevelt used it for visits from Washington DC to New York City. Also there is an elevator constructed specially for Roosevelt`s bulletproof car, connecting the train and the garage. This space was used only once since then. Andy Warhol made his own video art exhibition in 1965.<\/p> <p>Presidential rooms have unique amenities like multiple adjacent rooms for staff, bulletproof glass windows, and an interior design similar to the White House make this grand accommodation high up on the 35th floor the number one choice of sitting presidents when they visit New York.\u00a0Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed here, including President Obama, who sleeps here every time he\u2019s in town. Each president has also left the hotel a gift that is now featured in the suite (JFK left a rocking chair), so check back in a couple years to see what Obama leaves. Recently the hotel was bought by Chinese company. Fearing of espionage, current president, Barack Obama, did not stop in Waldorf Astoria this year, visiting New York City.<\/p> <p>There were filmed such movies as Weekend at the Waldorf\u00a0, Scent of a Woman, Coming to America.<\/p> <p>There are several residential units in the hotel, located on the 28th\u00a0to 42nd\u00a0floors known as the Waldorf Towers. These are some of New York\u2019s most desired homes, the smallest coming it at 1,600 square feet and many with a private terrace. All include 24-hour maid service, a private entrance and sky high price tags\u2014some of these rent for upwards of $100,000 per month.<\/p> <p>Many famous entertainers played here, including Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and Count Basie, as the city\u2019s elite dined on gourmet food and hit the dance floor for a spin. For 16 years the house band was led by Rumba King Xavier Cugat, a popular Latin music conductor who earned his chops in Cuba. There was even a terrace for summer dining with a city view. The retractable roof is long gone, but the Starlight Room is still available to host special events. Just this year, there was a gala honoring the memory of British singer Amy Winehouse with entertainment by Tony Bennett, Harry Belafonte and Jennifer Hudson.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In front of the building at 10:15","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Travel-Leisure\/events\/226073925\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":48600000,"name":"Waldorf Astoria Hotel Tour+ Lunch at Peacock Alley Restaurant","id":"226073925","time":1446909300000,"updated":1446959674000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1439071753000,"name":"Travel + Leisure","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18814226,"urlname":"Travel-Leisure","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":4.2847738266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":15,"created":1445105700000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Game starts at 10:15am sharp, so please arrive on or before 10:10am.<\/p> <p>Email me with questions.<\/p> <p>**Sign up opens on Wednesday night at 8pm, so be quick on the trigger**<\/p> <p>There are some little kids that use the field before us, so don't be scared when you see them on arrival.<\/p> <p>Turf shoes if you have em<\/p> <p>Light &amp; dark shirts<\/p> <p>Great attitude.<\/p> <p>Cheers<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BklynPickupSoccer\/events\/226344980\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":6300000,"name":"Saturday Morning Pick-Up Bedstuy 10 AM","id":"fqvnllytpbkb","time":1446909300000,"updated":1446917335000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1241024348000,"name":"Brooklyn Pickup Soccer Group","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1446129,"urlname":"BklynPickupSoccer","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425500916000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This will be posted everyother weekend to remind.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Lunches,<\/b> we can use 5-10 volunteers from 9:30am-2:30pm on weekdays<\/p> <p>\u00a0and 5-10 volunteers from 10:30am-2:30pm on weekends<\/p> <p>\u00a0for food preparation, sorting\/organizing incoming food and clothing donations, meal setup, serving one lunch meal and general cleaning projects.<\/p> <p><b>Dinner<\/b> service can only use 5-8 volunteers from 4:30-7:30pm on weekdays and 5-8 volunteers from 4:30pm-7:30pm on weekends - one meal \/ clean up<\/p> <p>\u00a0Volunteers must be over the age of 15.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we offer the opportunity for corporate groups to donate the operational price of one meal\u2014around $500.

This is a shorter, easier version of the skate I led last year. Last year, we did about 17 miles with lots of hill climb. This year, we're going to do 12.5 miles with an optional bonus 1.5, totalling 14. And we're riding an elevator to eliminate much of the hill climb.<\/p> <p>The general plan:<\/p> <p>* Meet at the waterfront<br\/>* Get a quick tour of Downtown Jersey City<br\/>* Ride an elevator<br\/>* See breathtaking views from the Heights and Weehawken<br\/>* Ride down a big, moderate hill<br\/>* Cruise home on the waterfront<br\/>* Eat tacos in the open air<\/p> <p>Optional segment, for advanced skaters \/ thrill seekers:<\/p> <p>* Ride a different elevator<br\/>* Ride down a big, terrifying hill<\/p> <p>It's going to be a blast! I can't wait to see you there.<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------<br\/>What to Expect<br\/>------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Sights? Stunning Manhattan skyline views from The Heights, a whirlwind tour of Jersey City (the good, the bad, the ugly), and a nice cruise along the Hoboken waterfront.<\/p> <p>How long? 12.5 mile loop with 1.5 optional loop for Hill-of-Death<\/p> <p>Pace? Approx 2.5 hours. Meeting point? Paulus Hook Ferry Terminal<\/p> <p>Time?<br\/>Meeting time: 10:30AM<br\/>Skates on at: 10:45AM<br\/>Briefing at: 10:55AM<br\/>Rolling at: 11AM Lunch at: Approx 1:30PM<\/p> <p>Food? Some of the best fresh-mex tacos around. Hills? There's one big hill climb and one big, safe, gradual downhill.<\/p> <p>Difficulty? This is a high-intermediate skate. A hair tougher than the average WNS, but way easier than a TNS. You MUST be able to confidently skate steep downhills and uphills, in a group, with traffic, and mount\/dismount curbs as necessary. In some neighborhoods, locals may give us the stink eye. You must not break stride as you smile and\/or give the stink eye in return.<\/p> <p>Road conditions? Moderate. I'll scout the route for rough pavement and make adjustments. We may be able to keep it smooth most of the way.<\/p> <p>Rests \/ water breaks? There are several short rests along the route. Water breaks: I've planned to stop at mile 6 and mile 12 to buy water. We can add another water stop if necessary. There's a bathroom at mile 14.<\/p> <p>Bail-out? The route has two bail-out opportunities:<\/p> <p>Mile 3: 2nd St Light Rail Station, Hoboken<br\/>Mile 10: Hoboken PATH Train<\/p> <p>We'll be skating right by these locations, so it's NO problem if we need to let you off and meet you at the restaurant!

I have never had trouble boarding barefoot or in stocking-feet, but I recommend bringing proper footwear just in case.<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------<br\/>How to Get There<br\/>------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>--------------------<br\/>By Ferry (best route):<br\/>--------------------<\/p> <p>Take the NY Waterway ferry from World Financial Center to Paulus Hook.<br\/>Departs every 15 minutes from 9AM to 9:45PM.<\/p> <p>Fare is $2.50 each way, plus the fresh air on the roof deck is really nice.<\/p> <p>--------------------<br\/>By PATH:<br\/>--------------------<\/p> <p>Take the Hoboken\/Journal Sqaure PATH train to Exchange Place PATH station, then come 2-3 blocks south to the ferry terminal.<\/p> <p>Fare is $2.50 each way. You can use a stored-value Metrocard but NOT an unlimited Metrocard.<\/p> <p>--------------------<br\/>By Car<br\/>--------------------<br\/>Parking on Sundays is widely available, especially since we are meeting in the business district. Look for spots along Christopher Columbus Ave, Montgomery, Grand, and side streets.

In our culture we are strongly conditioned to frame virtue in moralistic terms of good and evil; but interestingly, and importantly, Buddhism doesn\u2019t use those distinctions in defining virtue.\u00a0 Instead, it speaks to the process where our intentions and\u00a0actions are seen as\u00a0skillful or unskillful in terms of the positive states they create or the\u00a0suffering they cause\u00a0for others or ourselves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When we take this more expansive, less judgmental\u00a0process\u00a0view and remember that\u00a0we are\u00a0responsible for our own actions,\u00a0we can access and open to our natural\u00a0courage and curiosity about experiences.\u00a0We can use any positive or negative outcomes\u00a0as instructive and refine our course instead of getting stuck in negative states such as guilt or remorse.\u00a0We find more freedom from suffering when we are living wisely and acting skillfully and in sync with how things really are.<\/p> <p><br\/>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Lenny reveals his plan for 'jumpstarting' his new life: smoking the marijuana he has smuggled back from Colorado. Initially appalled, Curly finally agrees to Lenny's plan, and promises to visit a Head Shop in the morning to purchase items for smoking the weed. The next day, before entering the shop, Lenny reveals that he has made a list of items he wants to buy. Curly is surprised at the extent of the list.... and of Lenny's knowledge! They enter the shop and are greeted by a man named Dusty, who initially thinks they are undercover policemen. Lenny begins to get comfortable with Dusty, but Curly thinks he should not reveal too much about his plan. Curly leaves after Lenny tells him to 'lighten up'. Dusty (his friends call him Zombie), is impressed with Lenny's list, but tantalizes him with talk of showing him some 'new stuff'. They agree that Zombie will bring everything to Lenny's house later that evening. Zombie arrives, and instead of bringing the paraphernalia, he robs them at gunpoint, ties them up and gags them. They manage to remove the gags and call Curly's sister Diane. Diane arrives with her 'friend' Jennifer and they begin to cut the two loose. Lenny is smitten with Jennifer, who helps get a party started after releasing Lenny. After a raucous impromptu party, Lenny and Jennifer become friendlier, and she asks him if he is 'real disappointed ' about losing the drugs. He states that he is not, and that he has devised a new plan: A road trip to Vegas. Jennifer wants to go, but the other are reluctant. They are soon convinced that they should go too. Lenny proclaims that this is where his new life will begin, and they all toast to their big adventure.<\/p> <p><b>Acoustic Space<\/b><\/p> <p>'Acoustic Space' is a short film about how technology has changed the way we communicate. What Marshall McLuhan once described as a 'global village,' has become a society, if not a world, of people erroneously believing technology is bringing them closer together when in fact it is driving them further and further apart. The film addresses this issue in a funny and satiric way by showing a couple having dinner in an elegant restaurant while all attempts at conversation are constantly interrupted by their ringing cell phones.<\/p> <p><b>HOW TO BUY?<\/b> Tickets are available online:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Theater 3","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Filmmakers-Networkings-Screenings-and-Happy-Hours\/events\/226474641\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Big Apple Film Festival - Short Comedy Screenings","id":"226474641","time":1446918300000,"updated":1446930994000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1439168207000,"name":"New York Filmmakers Networking, Screening and Happy Hour","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18817303,"urlname":"New-York-Filmmakers-Networkings-Screenings-and-Happy-Hours","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Filmmakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10031","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"135TH STREET AND AMSTERDAM AVENUE","name":"ANNUNCIATION PARK ","lon":-73.952225,"id":8366122,"state":"NY","lat":40.818958,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":5.16854333878,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1445657349000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Please be there 15 minutes earlier so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click here for our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Game style and Rules:<\/p> <p>1.

Using real vulnerable programs in a contained lab environment, this hands-on class will get you up to speed on the basics in preparation for further study in this exciting realm.<\/p> <p><b>Instructor Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p>We're excited to have Georgia Weidman as our guest instructor.

\/><\/p> <p>People often talk about how others are self-deluded, not \u201ccorrectly\u201d seeing \u201creality,\u201d misinterpreting information and facts.\u00a0 But what if we\u2019re all self-deluded and we just don\u2019t know it?\u00a0 (Or maybe we\u2019re self-deluded about how well we can assess our self-delusions!)\u00a0<\/p> <p>Well, for one night, we will deliberate, discuss, debate, and challenge each other to consider these and other related considerations about self-delusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In particular, we will explore the ways in we (unknowingly) deceive ourselves, some cognitive and emotional reasons why we do this, and possible ways we can counteract these tendencies.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Some of the questions we will consider include, but are not limited to:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Why do people believe weird things?<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 How can our prior knowledge both help and hinder our perceptions and interpretations of new experiences?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 How is it possible that the same cognitive processes\u2014such as drawing inferences and making conclusions, synthesizing information from various sources, and analyzing and evaluating information\u2014lead us to both \u201caccurate\u201d and \u201creliable\u201d knowledge and also misunderstandings and misconceptions?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Is it possible to know when and how we are deceiving ourselves?\u00a0Is it even possible for us to see ourselves more clearly?<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 What counteractive strategies might help us to see ourselves, others, and the world around us more accurately and reliably?<\/p> <p><b>Structure of the Discussion:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will start by defining and establishing what self-delusion means and what examples of it could be.\u00a0 (It would be great if you could bring some real-life examples of people who you think have deluded themselves, or, even better, personal examples!)<\/p> <p>We will then discuss why and how people delude themselves.<\/p> <p>We will consider whether and how we can counteract these cognitive tendencies.<\/p> <p>We will reflect on the implications and applications of our discussion for our lives and the lives of those around us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will make conscientious efforts and an official commitment to delude ourselves less and less everyday!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About the

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

But if you want my advice, just enjoy your extreme bargain $4.50 masala dosa. There is also a nice sized menu of all types of South Indian vegetarian food as well: idlis, vadas, bisibelebath, soups, rice, etc.\u00a0 The best bargain, in terms of what you pay here vs. what you pay anywhere else, is the dosas. <b>The food here is 100% vegetarian but not all vegan.
