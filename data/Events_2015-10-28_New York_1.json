This introduction will\u00a0take you soup to nuts - integrating a calendar into your own solution from\u00a0scratch, customizing it, and rolling it out for multiple use cases. Don't come too late - the initial integration happens pretty\u00a0quickly.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nParadise Partners revolutionized FileMaker calendars in 2011 by introducing a user-friendly, drag &amp; drop FileMaker calendar in a web viewer with the release of\u00a0soSIMPLE v1. soSIMPLE v2 opened up the idea even further by introducing interactive calendars to FileMaker WebDirect, smartphone and direct-to-web. The latest\u00a0soSIMPLE v3 added standalone calendars for FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Go, making FileMaker Server optional. The newest version also added an out-of-the-box\u00a0experience with a fully featured calendar solution without any integration required.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on the 30th.

Over the course of the treatment, Greta finds herself repeatedly sent to 1918, 1941, and back to the present. Whisked from the gas-lit streets and horse-drawn carriages of the West Village to a martini-fueled lunch at the Oak Room, in these other worlds, Greta finds her brother alive and well\u2014though fearfully masking his true personality. And her former lover is now her devoted husband\u2026but will he be unfaithful to her in this life as well? Greta Wells is fascinated by her alter egos: in 1941, she is a devoted mother; in 1918, she is a bohemian adulteress.<\/p> <p>In this spellbinding novel by Andrew Sean Greer, each reality has its own losses, its own rewards; each extracts a different price.

The goal is to provide a safe space for discussion, sharing and learning related to the needs of persons of trans* experience. Registration for this event is free. Funding provided by the NYS DOH AIDS Institute LGBT HHS Initiative.<\/p> <p>Trans* is an umbrella term that refers to all of the identities within the gender identity spectrum. There\u2019s a ton of diversity in the different identities there, but we often group them all together by using the word trans*. The asterisk makes special note in an effort to include all transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming identities, including (but not limited to) transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman.<\/p> <p>Event Schedule: 9am-9:30am: Check-in and Breakfast<\/p> <p>9:30am-10:45am: Opening Remarks and Keynote Speaker Dr. Elijah C.

Are you uncomfortable around people who are talking about their accomplishments? Do you find yourself looking for ways to get out of conversations rather than into them? Perhaps instead you find yourself coming up with the answer while the person you are listening to goes on and on or maybe you like to take time to consider your answers. If you have had any of these experiences, you may be interested in this talk. In managing our career we have to be regularly in touch with people who we don't know well and whose good opinion we need. This puts us in the awkward position of talking to and potentially wanting favors from people we are not yet friendly with. Join career coach Win Sheffield to learn ways to move ahead in the face of shyness and reluctance to talk to strangers. Techniques covered will include:<br\/>- Recognizing how to use our strengths to impress your listener in more quiet ways<br\/>- Using story techniques to approach difficult to address successes obliquely<br\/>- Structured ways to approach and prepare for conversations<br\/>- Career management methods that minimize conversation Science, Industry, and Business Library (SIBL)<br\/>188 Madison Avenue at 34th Street<br\/>No reservations necessary<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gainfully-Unemployed\/events\/225359731\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":5400000,"name":"Career Management for Introverts","id":"225359731","time":1443736800000,"updated":1443743654000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1234284610000,"name":"Gainfully Unemployed","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":1379977,"urlname":"Gainfully-Unemployed","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Gainfully Unemployeds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"655 Madison Avenue (Btw. 60th & 61st St.)","name":"LK Bennett","lon":-73.965691,"id":24098274,"state":"NY","lat":40.76281,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":1.55300652981,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443103997000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/4\/8\/600_442318696.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>LADYDRINKS &amp; FEMFESSIONALS PRESENT \"HOW TO NETWORK BETTER, AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP\"<\/p> <p><br\/>OCTOBER 1ST 6\u20139PM<\/p> <p><br\/>LK BENNETT<\/p> <p><br\/>655 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10065<\/p> <p><br\/>Buy tickets here:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ladydrinks-october-edition-how-to-network-better-an-interactive-workshop-tickets-18003205071\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ladydrinks-october-edition-how-to-network-better-an-interactive-workshop-tickets-18003205071\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ladydrinks-october-edition-how-to-network-better-an-interactive-workshop-tickets-18003205071<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\nEvent Synopsis:<\/p> <p><br\/>October 1st, Lady Drinks hosts a workshop on \u201cHOW TO NETWORK BETTER.\u201d What messages are you transmitting with your body language when you first enter the room?

The son of Nathaniel Pousette, a painter, art director, educator, and art writer, and Flora Louise Dart, a poet and musician, Pousette-Dart was raised in an environment surrounded by music, poetry, and the visual arts, and began drawing and painting by the age of eight. Introduced to African, Oceanic, and Native American art by his father, Pousette-Dart made frequent visits to the Museum of Natural History as a young man. In 1938, he forged a close friendship with John Graham, whose writings were closely aligned with his own interests in spiritual concerns and so-called primitive art. Throughout the 1930s, Pousette-Dart was most entranced by the work of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, whose abstract sculptures, drawings, and forms in brass greatly informed the orientation of the young American artist.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Drawing Center exhibition will be the first in-depth consideration of Richard Pousette-Dart\u2019s drawings from the 1930s, a period when the artist pursued directly-carved sculpture, yet also painted, experimented with photography, and created numerous works on paper. These early drawings explore Pousette-Dart\u2019s concerns about sculpture and working three-dimensionally, and many reference the figure through full-frontal or profile views as they consider space, orientation, and volume. Additionally, numerous studies allude to dance, animal forms, masks, and heads, and many examples offer an accumulation of abstract and geometric forms, particularly for his brasses\u2014small sculptures meant to be \u201cheld in the hand.\u201d The exhibition will include approximately eighty works from the 1930s including drawings, notebooks, and brasses.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Rashid Johnson: Anxious Men<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/d\/b\/600_442397883.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Since distinguishing himself as the youngest artist in\u00a0<i>Freestyle<\/i>, the landmark 2001 exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem, Johnson has established himself as one of the preeminent artists of his generation. Invoking such varied themes as the black experience in America, the dialogue between abstraction and figuration, and the relationship between art and personal identity, Johnson has been discussed within the context of contemporary painting, photography, sculpture, video, installation art, and even performance. Now, with the Anxious Men, drawing enters that list.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Universally accessible and employing common visual tropes such as the monochrome and the grid, Johnson's work is also self-referential making specific allusion to his upbringing in Chicago and the Afro-centric values of his parents. In\u00a0<i>Rashid Johnson: Anxious Men<\/i>, the artist creates a site-specific installation in the Drawing Room gallery. The core of the exhibition is a new series of black-soap-and-wax-on-tile portraits that Johnson calls his \u201canxious men.\u201d Executed by digging into a waxy surface, they enact a kind of drawing through erasure and represent the first time Johnson has worked figuratively outside of photography or film, and on such a small scale. Whereas Johnson\u2019s previous work has taken a more cerebral approach to questions of race and political identity, the drawn portraits confront the viewer with a visceral immediacy. The portraits will be set within a multi-sensory environment that includes wallpaper featuring a photograph of the artist\u2019s father from the year Johnson was born, and an audio sound track comprised of Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s \u201cLove, That\u2019s America,\u201d a song that originally appeared in Peebles\u2019s 1970 film\u00a0<i>Watermelon Man<\/i>\u00a0and that was recently pressed into service by the Occupy Wall Street movement. In this way, the exhibition will create an immersive space that implicates not only the artist but also the viewer in its interrogation of selfhood and identity.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Open Sessions 5<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/f\/2\/600_442397906.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Open Sessions continues with artist-directed group exhibitions.\u00a0<i>Open Sessions 6<\/i>\u00a0features the work of Amadeo Azar, Daniel Barroca, Youmna Chlala, Lea Cetera, Onyedika Chuke, Alexandra Lerman, Harold Mendez, Marcelo Moscheta, and Ronny Quevedo. Organized by the artists and Nova Benway and Lisa Sigal, Curators of the Open Sessions program.<\/p> <p>Amadeo Azar explores the interrelation between the visual languages of modernism with political and social movements in Latin America, and the way those Utopian moments were disrupted as they encountered local circumstances. Daniel Barroca works with memory and history. His projects map forces anchored by images, objects, words, historical figures, and ideas. Lea Cetera produces temporal installations that examine the mediation of technology and the alienation of the human body. Through recent installations that include filmed performances, the artist attempts to create an alienating\/disorienting illusory effect. Youmna Chlala investigates architecture and fate. Her work is situated in places or bodies that translate themselves against or through an external world that is constantly trying to name them. Onyedika Chuke has been assembling an archive termed \u201cThe Forever Museum\u201d\u2014a collection of objects and images based on Internet-sourced documents that redistribute images and theories pertaining to civilizations, political rebellions, riots, and warfare. Alexandra Lerman proposes clay as a discursive medium. Her ink circulation drawings and \"memory negatives\" use copyrighted and patented systems to explore the complexities of contemporary body language and refer to the body located within institutional and natural environments. Harold Mendez draws upon ideas of absence and displacement to reference reconstructions of place and identity in the United States and Latin America, with a focus on how the past manifests in the present, and thereby trigger new inquiry. Marcelo Moscheta excavates the memories inscribed in the stone paths left by the ancient civilizations and uses GPS coordinates to draw his displacement over the surface of the planet. Ronny Quevedo traces culture through history, language, and mapping. Using a variety of forms from personal anecdotes to colloquialisms, coats of arms to store signage, games to modules, his work addresses concepts of displacemen<\/p> <p>See you at the Hop,<\/p> <p>Todd<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Giving the mid-September exhibition dearth this week's Hop will be a bit unusual - three openings in one gallery.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Thursday-Night-Gallery-Hop\/events\/225557260\/","yes_rsvp_count":50,"name":"Soho Bound","id":"225557260","time":1443736800000,"updated":1443756344000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1371295808000,"name":"Thursday Night Gallery Hop","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":8937872,"urlname":"Thursday-Night-Gallery-Hop","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Hoppers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"DUMBO","address_1":"79 Hudson Avenue","name":"Gallery GAIA","lon":-74.008865,"id":24097745,"state":"NY","lat":40.718491,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.39563751221,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442472086000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come to DUMBO for October's First Thursday Gallery Walk.<\/p> <p>Galleries will be open 6pm - 9pm.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

However, as the scale of data being processed in real- time at Twitter has increased, along with an increase in the diversity and the number of use cases, many limitations of Storm have become apparent. We need a system that scales better, has better debug-ability, has better performance, and is easier to manage \u2013 all while working in a shared cluster infrastructure. We considered various alternatives to meet these needs, and in the end concluded that we needed to build a new real-time stream data processing system. This talk will present the design and implementation of the new system, called Heron. Heron is now the de facto stream data processing engine inside Twitter, and we share our experiences from running Heron in production.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/8\/c\/600_441475948.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nKarthik is the engineering manager and technical lead for Real Time Analytics at Twitter. He has two decades of experience working in parallel databases, big data infrastructure and networking. He cofounded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real time streaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL that was acquired by Twitter. Before Locomatix, he had a brief stint with Greenplum where he worked on parallel query scheduling. Greenplum was eventually acquired by EMC for more than $300M.

But as anyone who has read horror fiction in the past 70-odd years will tell you, it's a bad idea to try to leave behind the gruesome goings-on in your life by moving to an island named Lovecraft. What begins as a study in coping with grief soon veers into creepy territory as the youngest Locke discovers a doorway with decidedly spectral qualities, along with a well that houses someone or something that desperately wants out and will use any means available to gain freedom, including summoning the teenage murderer who set events in motion in the first place. To say more would give away many of the surprises the creative team provides, but this first of hopefully several volumes delivers on all counts, boasting a solid story bolstered by exceptional work from Chilean artist Rodriguez (Clive Barker's The Great and Secret Show) that resembles a fusion of Rick Geary and Cully Hamner with just a dash of Frank Quitely.<\/p> <p><b>Purchase: <\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Locke-Key-Vol-Welcome-Lovecraft-ebook\/dp\/B007KDHKZ8\/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442096699&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=locke+and+key\">Amazon<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/locke-and-key-volume-1-gabriel-rodriguez\/1102715641\">Barnes &amp; Noble <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comixology.com\/Locke-Key-Vol-1\/digital-comic\/141951?ref=c2VyaWVzL3ZpZXcvZGVza3RvcC9ncmlkTGlzdC9Jc3N1ZXM\">Comixology<\/a><\/p> <p>or your local comic book store!<\/p> <p><b>eta:<\/b> \u00a0WE HAVE MOVED BACK INDOORS TO THE ATRIUM!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club\/events\/225311807\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"October Comic Book Club - Locke & Key Vol 1:  Welcome to Lovecraft","id":"225311807","time":1443740400000,"updated":1443752811000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1315347100000,"name":"NYC Girl Geek Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":2444702,"urlname":"NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York City","address_1":"520 8th Avenue (between 36th & 37th St)","name":"Ripley Grier Studio","lon":-73.992081,"id":18747582,"state":"NY","lat":40.754089,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.303378373384,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442772066000,"fee":{"amount":22,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACTING-FOR-NON-ACTORS\/events\/225491517\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":5400000,"name":"ACT-OBER BEGINS TOMORROW!!! 5 SESSION INTENSIVE LEVEL 1","id":"225491517","time":1443740400000,"updated":1443783608000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410733305000,"name":"ACTING FOR NON ACTORS","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":16992572,"urlname":"ACTING-FOR-NON-ACTORS","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"non-actor actors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"239 Thompson Street, New York, NY 10012","name":"Assembly Hall at Judson Memorial Church","lon":0,"id":23726301,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443226373000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for Freegan Film Night featuring Urban Roots.

In these circles we'll help everyone get in touch with their own inner shaman by teaching and practicing the principles and techniques of many ancient traditions.<\/p> <p>Carolina is on vacation this week so I'll lead the circle alone this time. She'll be back for the next circle. I'll perform a group soul retrieval in this circle. Soul retrieval is a basic shamanic technique which is practiced with many different techniques various traditions. Will we use benevolent magic prayer, meditation, writing of intentions and shamanic drumming in this circle to welcome lost aspects of our souls back into our lives.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nIn these circles we provide shamanic limpieza (cleansing of the body and energy field with green leafed branches, rum spray and rattling), and drumming for journeying.

Her intuitive and straightforward coaching helped us to re-connect our hearts and souls, work through difficult long standing issues, and feel like a team again. It felt like the ice melted; warm and caring feelings began to flow between us when we learned how to communicate and listen to each other\u2019s deeper feelings the way that Valerie guided us to do.<\/p> <p>We fell back in love after 8 years and now our relationship is better than it\u2019s ever been!

During his formative years, he read extensively and wrote terrible short stories and poetry to teach himself what not to do.<\/p> <p>Patrick matriculated at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, initially studying chemical engineering which led to a revelation that chemical engineering is boring. He then spent the next nine years jumping from major to major, taking semesters off, enjoying semesters at part-time, and generally rocking the college student experience before being kindly asked to graduate already. Surprisingly enough, he had enough credits to graduate with an English major, and he did so grudgingly.<\/p> <p>Patrick then went to grad school. He\u2019d rather not talk about it.<\/p> <p>All this time Patrick was working on \u201cThe Book,\u201d as he and his friends lovingly titled it. When he returned to Stevens Point he began teaching half-time while trying to sell The Book to publishers. In the process, he disguised a chapter of The Book as a short story and won the Writers of the Future competition in 2002. This put him into contact with all the right people, and after deciding to split The Book into three installments, DAW agreed to publish it. In March 2007, The Name of the Wind was published to great acclaim, winning the Quill Award and making the New York Times Bestseller list.<\/p> <p>All this success was wonderful. Patrick eventually had to stop teaching in order to focus on writing, though he screwed that up by having an adorable baby with his adorable girlfriend. He started a charity fundraiser called Worldbuilders and published a not-for-children children\u2019s book called The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle in July of 2010 through Subterranean Press, which was adorable, and seriously isn\u2019t for children.<\/p> <p>After a great deal of work and a few cleared throats and raised eyebrows from his patient editor, Wise Man\u2019s Fear came out in March 2011 to even more acclaim, making #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list. Life continues to rock for him, and he\u2019s working hard on writing the final installment of the series.<\/p> <p>JOEL HODGSON<\/p> <p>Joel Hodgson<br\/>In sixth grade, Joel Hodgson got into Magic and Ventriloquism and then went on to create the Peabody award wining Mystery Science Theater 3000. MST3K produced nearly 200 feature length episodes in a eleven year span on Comedy Central and SciFi. Last year, Joel concluded a six years run \"movie riffing\" live with the original cast of MST3K in \"Cinematic Titanic\" in theaters across the country. Joel currently voices the character of Mayor Bill Dewey in Rebecca Sugar's beautiful and funny \"Steven Universe\" on the Cartoon Network. This spring Joel will appear as chief engineer Zalian Fleisher in Paul Feig's new comedy science fiction series \"Other Space\" on Yahoo Screen.<\/p> <p>PAUL AND STORM<\/p> <p>Paul and Storm<\/p> <p>Paul and Storm (Paul Sabourin and Greg \u201cStorm\u201d DiCostanzo) are known internationally and across the Internet for their original comedy music (often with a \u201cnerd-ish\u201d bent). In addition to their own live performances, they are co-founders of the geek-oriented variety show w00tstock, along with Wil Wheaton and Adam Savage, and co-produceJoCo Cruise. The duo\u2019s original webseries musical, \u201cLearningTown\u201c, debuted on YouTube\u2019s Geek &amp; Sundry channel in January 2013. Also in 2013, their song \u201cAnother Irish Drinking Song\u201d was featured in the hit movie Despicable Me 2, and in July had their guitar smashed on stage by George R. R. Martin (and deserved it).

Please arrive at 7:45 to hear the featured speakers. This event is free and open to the public.<\/p> <p>The featured speakers will be Richard Epstein and Michael Huemer. They will engage in an Oxford-style debate. The proposition for debate will be: \"A government that performs its fundamental functions is preferable to a system of anarcho-capitalism in which these functions are privatized.\"<\/p> <p>Speaking in favor of the proposition will be Richard Epstein. Epstein is among the most influential legal thinkers in the world. He is a professor of law at New York University, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a professor emeritus and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. Speaking against the proposition will be Michael Huemer. Huemer is a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has written on philosophical skepticism, the problem of induction, ethical intuitionism, free will, deontological ethics, and other topics. His latest book, The Problem of Political Authority, published in 2012, is seen by many economics and philosophers as one of the most important intellectual breakthroughs of this age.<\/p> <p>Founded in 1985, the NYC Junto is a monthly meeting hosted by investor Victor Niederhoffer and moderated by Barron's columnist Gene Epstein.<\/p> <p>Related Links<\/p> <p>facebook.com\/events\/[masked]<br\/>meetup.org\/NYCJunto<br\/>twitter.com\/VicNiederhoffer<br\/>twitter.com\/NYCJunto<br\/>DailySpeculations.com<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCJunto\/events\/225609446\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":6300000,"name":"Richard Epstein and Michael Huemer will debate","id":"225609446","time":1443743100000,"updated":1443783267000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1299003570000,"name":"NYC Junto","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1791553,"urlname":"NYCJunto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"members of NYC Junto"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07070","country":"us","city":"Rutherford","address_1":"56 Elliott Pl","name":"Rutherford High School","lon":-74.108437,"id":5228222,"state":"Ne","lat":40.828243,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.23936653137,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441300636000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Speak and Lead is one of three Toastmasters clubs in the Rutherford area.

So I went on a journey of looking at the places where I was protected from fully knowing women...and then I went about detonating them. OM has been the ultimate metaphor for the type of sex I wanted and the relationships I desired. The only thing that ever kept me from being the man I wanted to be was to toss it all up and say \"What the fuck do I know? Take a risk!\" That\u2019s been my approach to this practice and to the lessons it\u2019s offered me ever since my first class.<\/p> <p>Daring to learn what goes on beneath the surface that has you become the man you want to be.

You can control time and space. This is a big secret that has not been available to humankind until now. You must understand that time and space are not fixed points, but rather dynamic and ever changing. Because everything works from a vibration frequency, tuning into and aligning with the right frequency can allow you to manipulate and change your experience of time itself.<\/p> <p>In fact, time is contextual and has a different perspective depending on our thoughts at a particular moment. As our thoughts change, so do time and space. This can happen gradually or instantaneously. What we don\u2019t realize is that these changes are going on all the time. We fail to notice them because we are caught within the vibrational wave.<\/p> <p>However, when we stand outside of it as observers, then we can witness how everything is not only subject to change, but can be changed at will. Our idea of history and the future are not fixed points but already exist together as one. We can change our past or re-experience it if we choose. We may also travel through our future to gain insight into how things in our lives will unfold.<\/p> <p>These secrets and the techniques for using them will all be revealed in the broadcast for the very first time ever! The frightening part of this is that the rulers of the planet are using these magical secrets to reshape the destiny of the planet. They have changed our history and are forcing us toward a dark future. But it\u2019s not too late. If we come to the realization that we can use this power too, then we can rewrite for ourselves a new beginning and new end.<\/p> <p>You\u2019ve been told from your earliest years that the world is objective and unchanging. Yet our world is experiencing radical transformation, which seems to be due to cultural, political, religious, and ideological conflicts. However, Master Qesankh Maa Kheperu will reveal that these are not sociological changes, but rather shifts in time and space affecting us without our direct knowledge.

I recommend arriving early to shop. To re-iterate what Iz said:: This is a great flea market\\yard sale! I have attended it several times and bought lots of good stuff. Get there early, however, as there are many tents in which to shop and LOTS of folks also looking for bargains. There are 20 tents with categories, a select few take credit cards, ALL take cash. There are sizes for everyone, and yes there's a tent just for MENSWEAR! - Michael i know you're happy. :)<\/p> <p>Here's the scoop on the 3 days:<\/p> <p>Day 1 - it's first look at everything that's been acquired &amp; sorted over the last month by volunteers. People typically start to line up at a tent of their choice as early as 830.<\/p> <p>Day 2 - regular day of shopping<\/p> <p>Day 3- HALF PRICE DAY! - so every tent all items are half price, and most tents also have a \"buy the bag\" option. Each tent has their own pricing, so as an example the office supplies tent does a $5.00 buy the bag, where bon ton has 3 different sizes to chose from $25, $55, $75.<\/p> <p>Feel free to stop by when your schedule allows. I will be there Friday and Sunday.<\/p> <p>You can take a train from Penn Station, NYC, to the Far Hills station stop in NJ on the Gladstone line. I think it's $14.25 each way, but it might be cheaper if you buy a round trip tik. Also, I think they have discounts for seniors, students, and disabled.

are created for those with physical disabilities, aliments, recovering from surgery, Seniors OR who are seeking a gentle practice to restore the body and mind.<br\/>Classes will include poses and methods that will allow students to increase muscular strength, endurance, flexibility as well as stamina, lung capacity and overall wellness. While experiencing the positive effects Yoga has on the mind-body connection. We will practice our asana's (postures) with the use of a chair.

Austin State University<\/p> <p>There has been a recent explosion of music apps created for iOS devices such as the iPad. Indeed, a search of \u201cmusic theory\u201d on the App Store remarkably reveals hundreds of results. This session, the result of a comprehensive corpus study, involves an interactive demonstration of pedagogical music theory and aural skills apps for the iPad. Such apps fall into several categories including: general apps for teaching, apps for theory fundamentals, apps for aural skills, and music games and puzzles. The session will include an exploration of each app\u2019s best features, ideas for their use, and a discussion of pros and cons for their use in different educational levels and purposes.<\/p> <p><b>Creative Interfaces for Exploring Musical and Theoretical Concepts<\/b><\/p> <p>S. Alex Ruthmann &amp; Ethan Hein, NYU Steinhardt<\/p> <p>The aQWERTYon and Groove Pizza are two interactive web interfaces in development within the NYU Music Experience Design Lab (MusEDLab), which researches and co-designs new technologies and experiences for music together with youth, educator, non-profit, and industry partners. The aQWERTYon maps the computer typing keyboard onto musical scales and pitch sets that can be synchronized to musical examples and videos on YouTube. The Groove Pizza is a radial rhythm interface that starts with drum beats and patterns from well-known songs as a starting point. Users can then adjust the \u201ctoppings\u201d to create variations on the rhythms, exploring various patterns and relationships. We\u2019ll share our interfaces in progress, some examples of how teachers are using these beta tools, and give participants the opportunity to play and give feedback on how these tools might be of use in the teaching of music theory and aural skills.<\/p> <p>===============================================================<br\/><b>Nathan Fleshner<\/b> is Assistant Professor and Coordinator of Music Theory at Stephen F. Austin State University. Before coming to SFA, Dr. Fleshner taught at Ithaca College and the Eastman School of Music, where he earned his PhD. He has presented papers at regional, national, and international conferences including the Society for Music Theory, the International Association for Analytical Psychology in Zurich, Switzerland, the Eighth European Music Analysis Conference in Leuven, Belgium, and the Second International Conference on Music and Consciousness in Oxford, England. He is particularly interested in the portrayal of dreams and mental illness in music. His other research interests include Schenkerian theory, the application of psychoanalysis to the study of music, connections between analysis and performance in cello music, popular music, and the pedagogical use of iPad apps.

The images speak in a commonplace language to the photographer\u2019s curiosity about the world she inherited, spanning landscapes both dramatic and quiet, interiors of living rooms and bedrooms, and objects that are talismans of past lives.<\/p> <p>The exhibition, which includes 70 photographs taken between April 2009 and May 2011, is organized for the Smithsonian American Art Museum by guest curator Andy Grundberg, former New York Times photography critic and associate provost and dean of undergraduate studies at the Corcoran College of Art + Design. Joann Moser, deputy chief curator, is the coordinating curator at the museum. The prints were made by David Adamson of Adamson Editions in Washington, D.C.

When I start to draw a painting and face a painting, the painting never allows me to escape from the truth that I draw a painting even in difficult times.<\/p> <p>\n\nBy drawing a painting, I saw myself and faced myself, and I was taught gaining an insight into life and the truth that there was. I haven\u2019t gotten away from the thing which I thought it was truth and the thing that there was. I\u2019ve accepted it and faced it and I\u2019ve repeatedly thought about and been distressed at the true meaning of living.<\/p> <p>I face up to the thing in front of me and I draw what I feel. At that time, I deeply feel a sense of fulfillment of live and repeat a pleasure and a pain of live several times in my mind. And when I finish a painting, I always sense happiness about that I am allowed to live, mystery of life and being life.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Bruce Lee, our Doorman, might try to steer you out sayingtehre is no gallery in the building.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

I actually have a later start time in hope that more of you will come. This intermediate ride is intended to challenge your stamina, introduce you to some real hills and prepare you for Bear Mountain in the weeks to come. You should know how to manage your gears for speed and for climbing. There are some parts of the route where the road is narrow, the cars are close and moving fast bring your bike handling skills into play. Stops will be limited and may push your endurance level. Bring snacks to munch on while cycling, not sure when or where we'll stop to eat, restrooms...yes! Once we reach Rockland State Pk we'll lap the lake before heading back over the mountain to Toga bike shop for a break at the 28 mile mark. This is not a ride to somewhere to eat ride, you eat what you or buy at the bike shop (mostly nutrition bars). Then we'll make our way back to the city. The return is hilly, if need we'll re-route.<\/p> <p>The fall temperature is here, so dress accordingly yet try not to over dress. Currently light showers are on the forecast for Saturday, if it's light showers we still ride, heavy is a no go. I will update you on ride status again come Thursday.<\/p> <p>If you are considering this challenge I encourage you to get out and ride during the week at least 20 miles at once with may be one shortly break. Your bike should be equipped with an odometer to keep track of your speed and milage.

We alluded to this at the end of last year and were already experimenting w\/ the format. The goal of the new name and format is to provide a space for CS teachers to share and exchange valuable pedagogical knowledge and practice from their classrooms. More specifically, at each meetup we plan on highlighting knowledgeable teachers and providing them a platform to present on a high leverage practice or set of practices they use in teaching CS.<\/p> <p>To that end, each meetup will have a few presentations \/ workshops for attendees to choose from (starting with 4 sessions, 2 running concurrently). By the end of the year, we\u2019ll have a repository of lessons that cater to a wide audience with content\/strategies that cover both advanced and novice material. The sessions themselves will be 75-90 min total, including Q&amp;A. These talks will not just be slides \/ one way sharing of learnings. For each session, we want the educators to actively engage with the topic--the more interactive the better (production of artifact and\/or engagement in an activity). Also attendees should be able to take at least one practice back from the session and implement it in their classroom.<\/p> <p>For the inaugural CS Pedagogy Meetup, we are honored to have <b>Dr. Cynthia Solomon, one of the creators of LOGO with us<\/b>, along with other experienced educators. We are still finalizing all the topics, so check back :)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>&gt; Cynthia Solomon -\u00a0Computer Cultures: Logo, Scratch and Beyond<br\/><\/b>I plan on looking at Logo and Scratch as two coding environments designed specifically for kids. They were both heavily influenced by Seymour Papert and his thinking about children, computers, and powerful ideas. Each has lead to its own computer cultures as formed by the interactions of teachers and learners. Creative, playful, imaginative experiences are likely. However, teacher influences on project choices and their views of the merits of debugging strongly influence what kids do and how they think about what they are doing.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Eric Allatta -\u00a0CSP Approaches and Strategies<br\/><\/b>Computer Science Principles (CSP) is a new Advanced Placement\u00ae course designed to expand participation in computer science by expanding the breadth of computer science curriculum. Students read and write much more in CSP than in a traditional CS course. CSP also demands large stretches (23 hours) of student-structured class time. This workshop will focus on a variety of approaches and strategies that assist the teacher in preparing students for the success on the course assessments. Eric is a CS teacher at the Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE) and intrepid leader of the evening meetup series.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Jason Bissonnette - Peer Evaluation and Error Analysis<br\/><\/b>This presentation will focus on having students evaluate each others\u2019 work, developing computer science skills through analyzing errors in code. Teachers will learn how to assist students in empowering themselves to conduct their own assessment of their work.<\/p> <p><br\/>Jason is a CS teacher at the Eagle Academy for Young Men. Here is a <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/JasonBTEALS\">video<\/a> of Jason talking about his involvement w\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tealsk12.org\/\">TEALS<\/a>. Jason is also part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/sepnyc.org\/\">SEP<\/a> program.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Sean Stern - Reading CS: Explicit Strategies to Help EVERY Student Engage with CS Textbooks, Tutorials, and Guides<br\/><\/b>CS education at the secondary and post-secondary levels often assume students come prepared to independently comprehend technical CS texts like textbooks, self-guided tutors, and forums. However, only 1\/3 of NYC public school students enter high school reading on grade level. To help ALL students engage with technical writing, it's imperative that teachers who use such texts (or wish to prep students for environments that will) provide students with active reading comprehension strategies. My talk focuses on my initial attempts to do so at the Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE)--a limited, unscreened NYC public high school in Manhattan--followed by a workshop where attendees attempt to build lessons around texts used in their own classrooms.\u00a0Feel free to bring along a copy of a CS text used in your classroom for the workshop!<\/p> <p>Sean is a CS teacher at the Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE) and the fearless leader of the CS Pedagogy Meetup! Here's a <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/SeanScratchToOthers\">video<\/a> from a previous meetup of Sean talking about transitioning from Scratch to other languages.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>We will start PROMPTLY at 9:45am<\/b>, so please arrive on time.

It is one of the oldest cities in America, having been 400 years since the it was founded. Having buildings that date back to the 1700's and 1800's has brought not only a timeline full of famous events and infamous character but also quite a bit of superstition and myth.<\/p> <p>Many of these stories center around the buildings and the people that used to reside there and in some cases still do. Below are five of the most haunted places in New York City and we Will Visit them \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>1. Morris-Jumel Mansion -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.morrisjumel.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.morrisjumel.org\/<\/a><br\/>Morris Jumel is currently the oldest home on the island of Manhattan and was once the residence to famous New York resident Aaron Burr as well as other lesser well known historic figures. The house was built in 1765 and is most well known for being the temporary headquarters for George Washington after his army's defeat at the Battle of Brooklyn. \u00a0Who haunts this place?\u00a0<br\/>The most famous ghost (there are several who are known to haunt the mansion) at the Morris Jumel Mansion is that of Eliza Jumel who was the wife of Aaron Burr, who himself is most famous for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Her haunting of the mansion is said to be because of the mysterious death of her first husband of which she was rumored to have murdered.<\/p> <p>\n\n2. The House of Death ------Located in the West Village, one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in all of New York City, this particular building was constructed during the late 1850's. The physical address of 14 West 10th street places it on a tree lined block where one would never know had a building nicknamed the House of Death. Its most famous resident was that of Mark Twain who called this place home during the early 1900's. The building name comes both from the ghosts that haunt this building and also from the tragedy that occurred here in 1989 where prominent attorney Joel Steinberg killed his adopted daughter by beating her to death.<\/p> <p>Who haunts this place?\u00a0<br\/>The house is known to be haunted by no less than 22 different spirits and apparitions ranging from young children, old ladies, and even a cat. Yet the most famous ghost comes in the form of Samuel Clemmons, known mostly as Mark Twain, who roams the bottom floors and basement of this building dressed head to toe in a white suit.<\/p> <p>\n\n3. The Dakota-\u00a0<br\/>Built in 1884, this building stands as a New York City landmark and is one of the most sought after residences in all of Manhattan. The building is most known as the location that famed musician John Lennon, who was a resident, was shot and killed while exiting. The Dakota was also where the horror movie \"Rosemarie's Baby\" was filmed due to its creepy gothic architecture style.<\/p> <p>Who haunts this place?\u00a0<br\/>While the ghost of John Lennon has been known to appear to residents of the building, he is not this locations most famous ghosts. This distinction falls to the ghosts of two young children who have been seen as far back as at least the 1960's. The children seem to be dressed in clothing that resembles that of the era of when the building was constructed, so the rumor is that they were once residents of the<\/p> <p>\n\nWho haunts this place? \u00a0While not the prevailing cause of his parting, the rumor that Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the White Horse is well known and often believed. This has not stopped his ghost from continuing to haunt his favorite watering hole even after his passing. His ghost is said to move things around in the bar as well as having been seen drinking at his favorite table before quickly disappearing. The bar helps keep his legacy alive and well by keeping a massive portrait hanging in the middle of the bar.<\/p> <p><br\/>4.. Jefferson Market Library<\/p> <p>Built originally to serve as a fire tower lookout in 1833, this building was expanded to serve as a courthouse in 1877. It was also the location for New York City's first night court due to its central location in the city's entertainment district at the time. This also caused it to expand its use yet again as a woman's prison as many of the defendants being prosecuted at the night court were prostitutes. It was also home to New York's most infamous court case in which Harry Kendall Thaw was acquitted of the murder of world renowned architect Sanford White by reason of insanity.\u00a0Who haunts this place? \u00a0While no specific ghost haunts this particular location, people have seen figures at night up in the top of the bell tower that is closed year round to the public. This location has also been home to female apparitions, which are known to roam the small park that used to be the location of the female only prison.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nOur Meal has been upgrade to An Authentic Inhabited Haunted-Place Restaurant \"Genes\" \u00a0Built on a\u00a0the a \u00a0Burial Ground. \u00a0David the Owner told me you can here \"Disembodied Voices\" ringing through the Dinning Room at night.

Most often we think of joy in terms of the pleasant feelings of comfort or well-being that we experience through our senses.\u00a0In the Pali\u00a0language, the term often translated as this definition of joy is \"sukha,\" that is closer to what we would call the feeling of \"happiness.\" \u00a0<\/p> <p>For our exploration of JOY as a factor of awakening\u00a0the translation of the Pali word\u00a0\"piti\" is\u00a0more apt.\u00a0It is understood as a mental state beyond our sensory experience,\u00a0and\u00a0is sometimes described in the same way the \"flow state\" is described. Meditative joy is not found in outward,\u00a0worldly rewards, but in the focused and concentrated mental state itself. We\u00a0meditate\u00a0for its own sake, not for some other purpose.<\/p> <p>When our minds are in a state of JOY, we lean more often and more consistently toward the positive aspects of experience; experiences that are\u00a0beautiful, wholesome, pleasant, and satisfying. \u00a0We also notice that our perceptions of unpleasant things become neutralized and we may even be able to see the \"silver lining\" or inherent lessons that are\u00a0present in every experience. There is also an increased\u00a0overall feeling of pleasure and happiness and a emotional resilience to adversity.<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value. I hope you'll join us.<\/p> <p><i><b>Fee by donation<\/b>: Suggested starting donation is $10 and your generosity is greatly appreciated. \u00a0No one is ever turned away for lack of funds.

We offer assistance to fixed-income senior citizens, the disabled, veterans, and others who qualify because they lack the financial resources to properly feed their pets.\u00a0 The HVPFP also assists animal shelters and rescue groups as the quantity of our food supplies permits.\u00a0 We distribute food in boxes, bags and cans for dogs, cats, birds, rabbits and some other domestic pets\u00a0 As of January 1, 2015, each month we are helping keep more than 760 animals at home and out of shelters by providing free pet food to 300 families.\u00a0 The Hudson Valley Pet Food Pantry serves residents of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Dutchess Counties who meet our eligibility requirements.

The first 30 minutes of the session will discuss our approach to treating the human figure as a series of simple shapes to more easily represent it. We will learn to solve basic drawing problems.<\/p> <p><b>Gesture Drawing:<\/b> What is it and why do we practice it? Students will approach gesture drawing two different ways. \u00a0This is an essential part of figure drawing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\"Great class! Surpassed all my expectations. As a beginner, I was amazed at how much I was able to learn...I had a blast &amp; highly recommend this intro course to others.\" Lou<\/i><\/p> <p><b>The Skeleton: <\/b>Students will learn the basic measurements of the human skeleton. Using a worksheet to follow a large diagram we will go through the entire figure to give students a functional understanding of the skeleton.<\/p> <p><b>Figure Drawing:<\/b>\u00a0What is our goal when drawing 5-10 minute poses? There is a great deal we can do in these medium length poses if only we set ourselves goals in the time allotted. We will practice two different approaches to these poses.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\"This was an excellent experience for beginning figure drawing. Simon provided a vast amount of knowledge regarding the essentials of drawing the human figure. Would definitely recommend this intro course to others.\" Robert\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Muscle Groups: <\/b>Students\u00a0will be introduced to the large muscle groups of the body in a similar manner to the skeleton above.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Long Poses:<\/b>\u00a0We will practice at least two long poses. Many of us run out of things to draw in longer poses. We grow bored and stop \u201cthinking\u201d while we work. With a proper focus we will find that these long poses will actually feel very brief to us.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Critique:<\/b> Drawings of willing students will be shown and discussed. We will talk about successes and what we can do to improve in the future. The goal of a good critique is not to criticize students but to point out future goals where they can improve. This allows them to leave the session eager to continue drawing and improving.<\/p> <p><b>Material requirements:<\/b> 14x17 inch sketch or drawing pad (not newsprint.) 2H, HB and 4B pencils.

This month we're reading <i>Annihilation <\/i>by Jeff Vandermeer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third expedition in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In\u00a0<i>Annihilation<\/i>, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.<br\/>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one anotioner, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.<br\/>They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers--they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding--but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything\"<\/p> <p>Meals, discussion, and voting on the next book to follow. Hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're in the back.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror\/events\/225312062\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer","id":"225312062","time":1443895200000,"updated":1443907703000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402509345000,"name":"Genre Book Club (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":15026732,"urlname":"Genre-Book-Club-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Horror","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"922 7th Ave","address_2":"At 58th St","name":"Le Pain Quotidien","lon":-73.97951,"id":884833,"state":"NY","lat":40.766287,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.25465869904,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441421191000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for a chat over coffee.<br\/>Every Saturday at 2pm.<\/p> <p>We can schedule our next meetup at your favorite coffee shop.
