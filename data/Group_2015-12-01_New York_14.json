While being \"active\" is subjective, I would say a good attendance of 20+ without \"no-show\" is a good indication.<br>As EO, one would reserve the court, post and host the event. He can also place all RSVP on wait list from which the EO would pick out the final tennists before the event date.<br>As a courtesy to the EO and members on waiting list, please change RSVP well in advance. The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.<br>EO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.<br>EO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.<br>From time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.<br>Members' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.<br>Professional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.<br>From time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game. Professionals can take advantage of such events to promote their services.<br>If you haven\u2019t notice, we call ourselves Tennist and our Headline is \u201cCome serve with Tennis Meetup!\u201d<br>Disclaimer: New York Tennis Meetup is an amateur platform that welcomes all tennis players.

Let's explore this important new text together from the beginning and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers. Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week. It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of A Course in Miracles, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. A COURSE OF LOVE builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth. Classes are $20 and class cards are available. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. Read more... You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here: http:\/\/crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday ACIM class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing). He produces arts\/cultural\/educational events at the Center, leads Inner Vision Workouts, and works as a CRS Healer and teacher of A Course in Miracles. In addition to studying ACIM with Yasuko Kasaki since 2003, he studied the Spiritual Psychology of Acting with London-based teacher John Osborne Hughes and Keith Johnstone-based Improvisation with the late Gloria Maddox.

I'm looking to put together a small-sized compatible group that would enjoy playing together once every week or two at the local public golf courses. By small-sized I mean eight or so people so we can have two foursomes. But if more people are interested then sure, we can expand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Although I'm mostly thinking of a group of guys playing golf, women would be welcome. My wife will likely join us sometimes also. Your spouse (or a golfing buddy) would be welcome also as space allows. As implied, this is not a singles meetup type of event. It's for people who enjoy playing golf and enjoy it that much more when playing with others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>If you can say \"yes\" to most of these questions then we could be a pretty compatible group:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. You're a young senior ... for myself I just turned 62. While \"young senior\" is not a \"have to have\" criteria to join decide for yourself if you think you would get along with such a group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. You're available during weekdays to play. ... Wanted so we can get cheaper rates. Being retired or semi-retired helps. Note: but we might play some on weekends also.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. You're nearby (within 7 or so miles of Cranford). ... This ties in with keeping the group small.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. You play in the area. ... As for me, I play at these public courses: Hyatt Hills, Ashbrook, Galloping Hills, and the Summit Muni (a par 3 course). Other courses are welcome if you have one you like. I also play at a private club but my limited membership makes it costly to play at (and only allows 3 guests at a time anyway).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. You can already play golf. You can be poor, mediocre, or quite good. ... So you know, my handicap is a 26. Yeah, that's on the high side but I'm getting better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. You follow good golf etiquette. ... For example, you keep up your pace of play. Also, you know and follow the rules (but if you need a mulligan please take it).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>7. Good attitude. ... Even if your game is going poorly you enjoy being out and can joke around with others. 'Nuff said? I think so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>So let's keep it simple and fun. We only have a month or so of golf left. And if it works out we can regroup next season after our initial foray this year.<\/p>","lon":-74.3099975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":145608742,"name":"D.

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give. This work demands of us at all times a deepened understanding and an increased ability to penetrate to new levels of consciousness so lifting humanity as a whole. http:\/\/www.lucistrust.org\/en\/service_activities\/start_a_meditation_group\/resource_center","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193144989,"name":"Lucis Trust","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/highres_250178629.jpeg","photo_id":250178629,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/member_250178629.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/thumb_250178629.jpeg"}},"members":43,"name":"New York Meditation as a Way of Life","id":18986696,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-as-a-Way-of-Life","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"South Orange","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443731112000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-growing-professionals\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>When you no longer feel a true connection with the crowd you grew up with and the co-workers...

It's a Movement born out of a weariness with the status quo that puts HR leaders and doers in a box. WGNinHR is busting us out of those boxes, and breaking all paradigms. It's for those who dare to ask 'what's next?', expecting to be challenged to new levels in HR - or even outside of it...to the C-Suite and perhaps, eventually, to the top seat. After launching as a (virtual) membership organization (<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgninhr.org\">www.wgninhr.org<\/a><\/b>), WGNinHR is now ready to establish a NY presence. If you'd like to meet like-minded HR pros looking for creative ways to advance their careers, join this growing Movement - and become a part of our Meetup. &nbsp;The Meetups will include networking, light refreshments and interactive learning opportunities!<\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s in a Name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On playgrounds across the nation, and maybe even the globe, someone is screaming out a familiar question \u2013 \u2018who\u2019s got next?!\u2019&nbsp; The question is asked of the person confident enough to step onto the court or playground, grab the ball \u2013 and then do something <i>amazing<\/i> with it.&nbsp; That\u2019s where the name for this organization came from.&nbsp; Its focus is on the HR professional who dares to not only ask the \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 question, but to shape the answer! <\/p>\n<p>This is a Movement looking to challenge your thinking, and that of the folks who surround you who may be suffocating your career aspirations, perhaps unintentionally. The fact is, too many HR pros are convinced that they can\u2019t aspire to more \u2013 in their fields, outside their fields, to the C-Suite and even to the CEO seat.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is for you.&nbsp; Whether you\u2019re the aspiring HR pro having just graduated and in your first HR gig, or the more seasoned among us with 20+ years of HR and business experience.&nbsp; This is for you <i>if <\/i>you truly believe that there\u2019s more to your career story.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>NY Trailblazers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The goal is a monthly meetup like no other.&nbsp; Yes, there will be networking which is awesome. Yes, there will be refreshments to give us the energy boost at the end of a day.&nbsp; But, we\u2019ll strive for even more.&nbsp; Creativity.&nbsp; Innovation.&nbsp; New \u2013 and quirky \u2013 thinking about old issues and hot topics which impact HR leaders aspiring for more.&nbsp; Interactive learning sessions will serve as incubators for ideas that may ultimately position HR leaders as the smartest people in the room\u2026.whether it\u2019s the conference room or the board room.<\/p>\n<p><b>Want to Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If this group resonates with you, we\u2019d love to have you!

Depending on turnout, we may each do this again with a second monologue.

I am calling this conclave Voki-all-joyo. Each week, on Sunday morning, we will meet for a presentation, discussion, and sharing of ideas. These ideas are meant to be about the issues most important to your heart: <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;Why are you here? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you believe? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you learn? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How do you succeed? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp; What should you being doing to make the world better? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How can you be happy(ier)?<\/p>\n<p>This is not about doctrine, dogma, or definiteness. This is about dialectics, discourse, and discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Each week a topic or theme will be presented around ideas or thoughts from the realms of science, western philosophy, eastern philosophy, and literature. I draw on the world of many great western minds, including: Thoreau, Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, Sun Tzu, Epictetus, Jung, Aquinas, Fromm, James..\u2026 and as a Sanskrit theorist I draw on many of the ancient Vedic texts, the Mahabharata, The Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Upanishads, The Bengali poets and scholars, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the topics will be about yoga, science, meditation, philosophy, and basically all things that can be used to help us explore how to both think more clearly and at the same time reside happily in the cloud of unknowing.<\/p>\n<p>Each week I will offer a presentation about the topic that is no more than 17 minutes long.&nbsp;We will then have a discussion on the topic, and sharing time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>So, remember to bring something that inspires you to share. It can be a piece of music, a photo, a poem, or even a short anecdote.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>I will close the session with some brief remarks, and then go to brunch, or, if the weather is nice, on a picnic.

I speak four languages and can read and write Sanskrit. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in educational psychology. I am spiritual, but not religious. I am agnostic, but not atheistic. I am rational, but not close-minded. I am here to be of service to others. I like art, history, science, music, literature, and things that buzz or blink. I think coming together as a community on Sunday mornings has value, but I\u2019m not into church. I want to grow and learn in the company of my peers, and friends, free from the dictates of dogma and blue hair.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I have created Voki-all-joyo (phonetic for voki al \u011dojo.) This is Esperanto (one of my favorite languages) for Call to Joy. I named it this because I am convinced that our constitutional position as spirits in a human form is to be full of joy. I aIso feel strongly that clear thinking is the best path to real joy. Please note, when I say, \u2018be full of joy\u2019, I do not mean joy in some horribly homogeneous way, like a narcotized, monolithically emotional state. I mean joy, as in a rich state of appreciation and wonder at the mystery and beauty of life. (Like the feeling you get when you find a box of Twinkies in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland.)<\/p>\n<p>So, think of this as a pasta sea of fellow swimmers who are looking for what binds us together without being bound up by the ligaments of human speculation. Since perhaps, it is not so wise to hold dear that which is so dearly held by those who prefer not think for themselves:)<\/p>\n<p>Think clearly and be grateful <br>(Pensi klare kaj esti dankema)<\/p>\n<p><i>Atma<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Our club greeting: <\/b> <br>~ Ne estu schmuckie (Don\u2019t be a schmuck)<\/p>\n<p>~ Vi nek (You either)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/highres_442780987.jpeg","photo_id":442780987,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/600_442780987.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/thumb_442780987.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13673881,"name":"Atma Degeyndt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/highres_250316380.jpeg","photo_id":250316380,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/member_250316380.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/thumb_250316380.jpeg"}},"members":62,"name":"NYC Philosophy, Science, & Spirituality Meetup","id":19002525,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Philosophy-Science-Spirituality-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Clear Thinkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444165393000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"realestateagent","name":"Real Estate Agent","id":2027},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"realtors","name":"Realtors","id":16166},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-broker","name":"Real Estate Broker","id":22932},{"urlkey":"accountant","name":"Accountant","id":23654},{"urlkey":"home-loans-mortgages","name":"Home Loans, Mortgages","id":27516},{"urlkey":"mortgage-brokers","name":"Mortgage Brokers","id":32915},{"urlkey":"legal-professionals","name":"Legal Professionals","id":34082},{"urlkey":"attorneys","name":"Attorneys","id":71041},{"urlkey":"hard-money-lenders","name":"Hard Money Lenders","id":171805},{"urlkey":"bankers","name":"Bankers","id":1501312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Real-Estate-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"We are a dynamic and well connected networking group bringing together real estate brokers, accountants, bankers, title companies, investors, attorneys, and everyone who is active in the real estate industry in an effort to connect, exchange ideas, and join forces to build their respective businesses, skill-sets, networks, and perspectives.\n\nWhether you are just starting out in real estate and looking to learn, or are working on building long term business relationships and increasing business revenues, this Meetup is for YOU.\nMembership to our group is free.

I found that pregnancy is an experience that is as exciting as it is scary. And there is no better way to make it through this experience than finding support from other mothers. Through this group we can grow lasting friendships, share advice, and also organize future playdates. We can even get together to have a few mommy night out events, which I'm sure we will all need. I hope to have a new meetup each week in which we can get together to chat, attend workshops, and even have pampering events. This is a great way to make some friends if you are a first time mom without friends with kids and if you are new and would like to meet other expecting mothers.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":93745422,"name":"Anna Hassanah Avalone","photo":{"photo_id":118040752,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/1\/0\/member_118040752.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/1\/0\/thumb_118040752.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"New Mommies in Harlem","id":19003202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-Mommies-in-Harlem","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Social Mommies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baldwin","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444182096000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"financial-literacy","name":"Financial Literacy","id":15503},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"financial-health-literacy","name":"Financial Health & Literacy","id":16840},{"urlkey":"financial-chaos-to-financial-freedom","name":"Financial Chaos to Financial Freedom","id":79053}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Applied-knowledge\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>If i can show you how to cut your debt, minimize your taxes and increase your income so that you have more money to save, would you let me?<\/p>\n<p>This place is where we can network. &nbsp;I'm looking for individuals that have entrepreneur mind set, Looking to start a business.

Yes, there IS bias here because MWC members are highly capable in the many roles they pursue \u2013 which include: chefs, friends, bankers, teachers, quilters, artists, lawyers, parents, authors, doctors, musicians, agents, philanthropists, spouses, entrepreneurs, professors, caterers, accountants, designers, producers, historians, actresses and grandparents. And probably a few Indian chiefs, too! The MWC \u201cclubhouse\u201d is New York City and its immediate environs because of the infinite variety, diversity and scope New York offers in terms of extraordinary things to see and do.

The story is adapted into short scenes; after each scene is presented, the action stops, and the Presenter engages the students in a conversation about the issues they just saw. The students, then, have the opportunity to see the scene again or continue to the next. After the play is completed, ,students have a chance to converse with the characters about their actions during the play. \u201cThe Gioconda Smile\u2019 is designed for all ESL students. We want to encourage them to talk about the ideas that they see in each scene, and show them that they can enjoy a play in English and understand it. The schedule is Monday, Oct. 26 through Thursday, Nov. 5 with day and evening performances. Tickets are $15.00. All performances are at Clarion Theatre, 309 East 26th Street, NYC.

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw.

If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly.

They<b> don't have a Buyer's List and they are afraid to get a property under contract <\/b>because they may not be able to sell it before the closing date.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With Co-wholesaling you don't have to have both a buyer's list and a property under contract you can market a property that another group member already has under contract. Why would you want to do that? You get a chance to build a buyer's list by marketing a real property if you find a buyer you get paid a % of the wholesaler's fee if not you are still building a buyer's list from all the buyers that contacted you. If you are great at finding deals then you get a bunch of free marketing to sell more properties faster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Joint Venture Fix and Flip deals are a way to leverage your capital<\/b> For example: a group of 5 people with $20K each can find, analyze, offer, fix and market a deal they bought for $50K +50K rehab and sell for $200K each profiting $20K + their original investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to <b>provide a structured format for team real estate investing by combining learning with hands on action taking.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Let's do some deals together!<\/b><\/p>","lon":-74.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/b\/2\/highres_443019858.jpeg","photo_id":443019858,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/b\/2\/600_443019858.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/b\/2\/thumb_443019858.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":46626772,"name":"A.D.

Our shop also hits dulcet notes with dessert crepes, pastries and confections. We pack those crepes full of sweet fillings, such as fresh fruit, before crowning them with more fresh fruit and drizzling Nutella on top.

Live Life Outside Your Box***<\/strong> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/a\/a\/9\/600_443050921.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean?<\/strong> We live inside our own personal boxes without realizing that there is a whole other world out there for us to see. <\/p>\n<p><strong> What does it really mean to live your life outside your box?<\/strong> There\u2019s not an actual box.<\/p>\n<p><strong> \u201cLive Life Outside Your Box\u201d is the way you choose to live your life<\/strong>. The sum total of your life experiences.&nbsp; Everyone\u2019s is different and the more times you step outside it, the bigger your box gets. <\/p>\n<p><strong> There\u2019s just one little problem.<\/strong> Your life inside your box is where you are the most comfortable. It\u2019s safe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ask \u201cwhy should I live outside my box?\u201d<\/strong> Well, there are many reasons. First, and most important, it helps you GROW as a person. You will see the world in a different way. You will learn new things, meet new people and become more of the person you\u2019re supposed to be. When you grow, you have more to offer others and you get back more from them. In short, you will live a more successful life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ask \u201cHow does one live life outside the box?\u201d<\/strong> It will take a lot of courage but you CAN DO IT! Start small and get bigger. Try something new\u2026 maybe try a new cuisine you\u2019ve never tried before. Try to do something that you wouldn\u2019t normally do. For example, learn indoor rock climbing. Take a cooking class. Do something that\u2019s not already in your box. You have to do something NEW. Something different. Something that you have never done before.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As you get comfortable with small steps, take bigger steps<\/strong>. Skydive. Speak in front of a group of people. Perform in a play. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do as long as you step outside of your comfort zone to do it and you keep growing your comfort zone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eventually, you will be able to take a giant leap.<\/strong> Is there something in your life that you\u2019ve wanted to do, but have been afraid to do it? Face up to it and do it. This is when you begin to direct your steps so that you can get the life you want. <\/p>\n<p><strong>As you grow and your box grows<\/strong>, you will begin to focus your steps in a positive way. It becomes easier.&nbsp; Every time you take a step, your vision expands, you grow as a person. Your box gets a little bigger. You move to a higher purpose just as you were meant to do.<\/p>\n<p>One of our greatest sources of authentic power in life comes from our willingness and ability to act \u2013 especially in the face of obstacles and fear. <\/p>\n<p>To be truly successful and fulfilled, we must challenge ourselves to take bold and courageous actions and to go for and do what we want.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT GROUP RULES: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group. It is about the quality of members in the group! We would rather have a small group of \"quality members\" than a huge group of \"joiners\" and \u201clurkers\u201d who never show up to any event.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>With that said, please note:&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(1) To join the group, you must have a recognizable face picture; and<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(2) Being a member in the group, you don\u2019t have to attend every event on the calendar, but try to participate in at least 1 event every few months.

Research show's that being a part of a community that shared your goals is integral to achieving them. Personally, I've always participated in team sports or activities like football, wrestling, rugby, and martial arts. What keeps me coming back and engaged is the community and camaraderie inherent in these group activities. Weightlifting is another matter though. I know my way around a gym, but lifting alone is difficult for me. The lack of accountability and engagement usually leads me to modifying routines that shouldn't be modified or abandoning lifting all together and focussing on my group activities (Currently Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). So my goal for this group is to find some more buddies who want to partner with me on lifting. I'm going to be on the program outlined in \"Man 2.0, Engineering the Alpha.\" This group is for guys like me, to find other guys like me, so that we can do this together! While I have a specific program that I want to engage, this group will serve as a hub for other guys in our situation to meet one another, find someone else who wants to engage in a program of your choosing and move onward!","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":42906772,"name":"Shane","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/highres_247885566.jpeg","photo_id":247885566,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/member_247885566.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/thumb_247885566.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"Personal Revolution Workout Buddies","id":19029933,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Personal-Revolution-Workout-Buddies","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Savages"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444920289000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"korean","name":"Korean Language","id":862},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"business-in-china","name":"Business in China","id":16053},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"learning-chinese","name":"Learning Chinese","id":56708},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584},{"urlkey":"asian-singles-30s-40s","name":"Asian Singles 30s 40s","id":96692},{"urlkey":"asian-americans-30s-40s","name":"Asian Americans 30s 40s","id":96694},{"urlkey":"mandarin-chinese","name":"Mandarin Chinese","id":127454},{"urlkey":"movies-and-movie-watching","name":"Movies and Movie Watching","id":280301}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asian-NYC-Watching-Movies-Weekend-Events\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for Asians or anyone interested in joining movies and cultural events, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. I started this group because I am a big fan of cinema but I hate to go see a movie alone.

I chose personal development!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I have studied this industry for over a decade and was privileged to meet some very rich and wealthy people. Over the years I have only practiced strategies used by the wealthy and it has transformed my life from not being able to afford most things to now-being able to live a life free of financial boundaries. As a result I wanted to share what I've learned from self-improvement and the only way I could do that was to create a new word, \"Selfceed\". Selfceed means to succeed in self, building a sound character that runs on a core philosophy of, you are what you attract by the person you become. &nbsp;The Selfceed Forum is essentially a <b><i>book club forum<\/i><\/b> designed to help members make more money, manage their time and problems better by interacting with like-minded individuals who practice self-improvement. Our only requirement is that when you join us, you come with an open mind and a coachable outlook.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Napoleon Hill invested decades into exploring what millionaires and billionaires<i><b>&nbsp;in America<\/b><\/i> had in common.

From a self-defense aspect it can end an attack suddenly, severely and decisively or dissipate it with the gentleness of a soft breeze. <\/p>\n<p> <br>Aikido's unique approach is to blend with an attack rather than clash with it. The attack is redirected safely away into a throw or pin. Its circular, flowing techniques are effective and can be learned by anyone regardless of size, age or gender. Men, women, children and seniors all find it appealing because Aikido techniques are not based on pitting one's strength against another's. Students learn to defend themselves without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Self esteem, concentration, awareness and focusing power are enhanced. Balance and calmness are therefore maintained in all situations. This state of being is then carried off the mat and into the activity and interactions of daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers was established in 1988 after Sensei O'Connor had been studying and teaching for 12 years. At Aikido Centers we teach traditional Aikido as handed down by Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers is the largest traditional Aikido dojo organization in New Jersey.

For example, a technique does not work by itself unless combined with the concepts of balance, power, speed, focus, timing, and attitude. When combining these elements, the outcome or whole is far more effective then what would normally be the sum of the parts. This is the reason techniques, as practiced in the system, are only tools used to understand, accept and retain these ideas. The number of different techniques mastered by an individual does not increase his level of competence in this system. Techniques are only practiced moves until combined with the proper fighting concepts. The ultimate goal of the martial arts is to make your mental, physical and technical skills work as one. The goal of Latosa Escrima is to do this while producing a quality Escrimador who can think creatively and react responsively rather than giving people information overload. Escrima was the original name used under the flag of the Philippine Martial Arts Society. The name changed to Combat Escrima as the system was influenced by the concept of using power and combat reality. Combat Escrima relied on a single goal; winning. This goal proved to be a very valuable asset. The intimidation factor of the name \"Combat Escrima\" was something the students felt they had to defend. However, just the goal of winning actually proved limiting in the progression of the system and future instructors. PMAS produced excellent fighters and world champions but failed to produce very many well-rounded instructors. PMAS had the box recipe for producing competent fighters but failed to isolate the individual ingredients that make up the end product. Latosa spent his time developing training methods used to understand the reasoning behind the techniques and isolating the concepts of Escrima. Wing Tzun is self defense in it's most consequent form Wing Tzun is the smartest self-defense system ever thought of by humankind, because Wing Tzun is not based upon physical strength or acrobatic ability and therefore allows a physically weaker person to defend him\/herself. Wing Tzun teaches you to use the force of the opponent and turn it against him. Wing Tzun self defense movements derive from tactile reflexes that are mechanical and directly determined by the attack of the opponent. In this way WT is not susceptible to optical manipulations meant to mislead the fighter. Wing Tzun can be learned fairly quickly and built upon.

Participants will learn how to develop their musicianship more quickly by utilizing modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam groups since 2010. &nbsp;The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the ABB. &nbsp;These sessions are a lot of fun. &nbsp;Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the ABB with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.&nbsp; Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.&nbsp; Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.&nbsp; Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. &nbsp;Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.&nbsp; Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN: <\/p>\n<p>The music of The Allman Brothers Band is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. &nbsp;However, learning the music of the ABB can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I can help you learn. &nbsp;This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the ABB played it. &nbsp;The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.&nbsp; I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.&nbsp; The charts are clear about song form,&nbsp;intros, &nbsp;chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.&nbsp; Both Duane Allman and Dicky Betts' parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In most cases, Berry Oakley's bass lines have been transcribed. &nbsp;The ABB shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose. <\/p>\n<p>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN: <\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord&nbsp;progressions and song&nbsp;forms; the actual chord voicings;&nbsp;specific chord progressions used during the improv sections; slide guitar techniques; pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;&nbsp;chord\/scale combinations; use of chromaticism; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation to improvise.&nbsp; There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.&nbsp; People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation. <\/p>\n<p>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. &nbsp;In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on many songs including: &nbsp; Staesboro Blues, Trouble No More, Don't Keep me Wonderin', Done Somebody Wrong, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Dreams, Blue Sky, Hot 'Lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Little Martha, Midnight Rider, Mountain Jam, Stormy Monday, Whipping Post, You Don't Love Me and others.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE COORDINATOR:<\/p>\n<p>I am a professional musician with over 40 years experience. I began playing the guitar at four years old and performing professionally at 15. &nbsp;I've performed all over the world at countless venues and festivals. &nbsp;Additionally, I teach privately and at a variety of music schools. &nbsp;As a performer and recording artist I play many styles of music including rock, blues, jazz and folk.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/highres_443233561.jpeg","photo_id":443233561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/600_443233561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_443233561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13972016,"name":"Luke Johnson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/highres_12000209.jpeg","photo_id":12000209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/member_12000209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/thumb_12000209.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"New York City Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam","id":19041096,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Allman-Brothers-Band-Song-and-Jam","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"ABB Jammers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445265527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"black-singles","name":"Black Singles","id":17053},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-datengamenyc-com\/","rating":1,"description":"<p>Date N Game is a social networking event for young professionals to meet and network.

In this lively, interactive workshop, Robert Vetter deconstructs processes of spiritual healing found in cultures found all over the world, and shares a formula for healing that can be adapted to almost any energetic or spiritual healing discipline. By looking at the methods of other cultures, you will understand on a deeper level what healing is, how it works, and the ways that various healers master a universal code that underlies the healing process.\n\nWorkshop topics include:\n\n\u2022 Understanding your calling as a healer\n\u2022 Developing a healing presence\n\u2022 Respectfully borrowing healing practices from other cultures\n\u2022 Constructing altars to invoke the power of symbols in healing\n\u2022 Engaging all 5 senses in healing\n\u2022 Grasping a deeper meaning that underlies the wounded healer archetype\n\u2022 Methods of self-protection that you can implement in your practice\n\u2022 The power of narrative medicine: using words to heal\n\u2022 Acquiring healing energy\n\u2022 Soul retrieval and re-integration\n\nDuring this workshop, you will develop your own unique healing protocol that is a reflection of who you are on your individual journey. In learning to heal using this method, you will also uncover how healing is a spiritual path that directs us through the entire cycle of human life, imbuing it with meaning and purpose.\n\nRobert Vetter, M.A. is a cultural anthropologist, who began his studies of cross cultural healing practices at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980\u2019s. He has apprenticed and learned from a variety of teachers in modalities that include traditional Mesoamerican medicine (Curanderismo), Native North American medicine, and Medical or Healing Qigong among others. He maintains a healing practice in what he calls Ethno-Energetic Healing.

It is a mood disorder that accompanies the other premenstrual symptoms. The PMDD gets more severe as the period draws near, escalating the sufferer to a state of very high tension, anxiety and aggression. It enhances other coexisting mood disorders to complicate any treatment for several days during the month. PMDD is thought to be a brain chemistry malfunction that is triggered by ovulation. Symptoms usually begin after ovulation and last into the first days of the period. This cycle repeats itself every month. PMDD is tied to the hormonal changes triggered by ovulation, so it does not occur without this part of the menstrual cycle. The condition affects up to 8 percent of women. The condition involves much more than a bad time during a period. It is cyclical, occurring at the same point in the menstrual cycle each month. The symptoms of PMDD are severe and usually life altering. Doctors require sufferers to have at least five of the following symptoms to support a diagnosis: Depression of hopeless feelings Feelings of anxiousness, tension or edge Irritability that increases as period nears Oversleeping or insomnia Lack of interest in favorite things No motivation Loss of energy Difficulty focusing and concentrating Loss of control feelings, feeling overwhelmed Severe physical manifestation of PMS symptoms like tender breasts, cramping, bloating, muscle pain and weight gain Suicidal thoughts Source: http:\/\/www.psychguides.com\/guides\/living-with-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\/ Message from Organizer: Last year I learned that I have PMDD. The only thing I found that truly helps the mental aspect of PMDD is joining online forums where other women discuss their experiences with PMDD, thus learning that I am not alone. I am making this group so members can meet and give support to other PMDD suffers. I'm calling the members \"Lunar Girls\" because of how we're affected by our cycle, much like the moon. I thought about calling us werewolves but that seemed a bit extreme. Any better suggestions will be considered.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":79227982,"name":"Kristy Rose","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/a\/c\/highres_146096492.jpeg","photo_id":146096492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/a\/c\/member_146096492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/a\/c\/thumb_146096492.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"New York Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Support","id":19041800,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Premenstrual-Dysphoric-Disorder-PMDD-Support","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Lunar Girls"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Woodside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445275008000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"healthy-kids","name":"Healthy Kids","id":26024},{"urlkey":"kids-meeting-kids","name":"Kids Meeting Kids","id":655642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tinkergarten-Woodside-Sunnyside-Queens\/","rating":0,"description":"FREE Trial Class at The Doughboy Park: Taste of Tinkergarten, Thursday, October 22nd 11:00am Come join us for a sample of what a Tinkergarten class is all about!

Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter. The Song Club is led by the founder of the Collective -Peter Bliss. The Collective Song Club\u201d will begin on October 14th and follow every other Wednesday evening (skipping the night before Thanksgiving). It will take place at Planet Studio NYC (www.planetstudionyc.com) 244 West 54th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue in Suite 800B on the 8th floor. It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like! There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage! The CSC is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see! Join us for our first session on October 14th and let\u2019s see what happens! Peter Bliss \/ Profile: Peter Bliss songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties. He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film. He\u2019s shared his expertise creating workshop and event programs for the Songwriters Hall of Fame and now the New York Songwriters Collective. Peter works from his \u201cPlanet Studio NYC\u201d recording studios located in Manhattan, arranging, recording and producing other artists to help bring their music to life.

Stretch, Risk, Die. This Intro talk is going to give you such a great boost for the New Year! You will learn something new about yourself and your place in the world.&nbsp; The people who choose to join this group are people who are tired of letting fear and uncertainty run their lives. People who want to experience clarity and direction. This group is about taking you where you are and moving you forward in specific areas of your life. We will talk and share our fears,&nbsp;struggles and triumphs. Are you brave enough to take the first step in being fearless? If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s not a coincidence. You\u2019re ready to live your biggest, most fearless life. Keep reading to find out how... Have you ever felt stuck in your life? You can't quite figure out what's stopping you but you can't quite get yourself going either? Have you ever had a recurring problem that just won't go away? You thought you solved it once but oh no, that same problem just keeps popping up again and again. Have you ever felt like you should be doing something different or something better than you are but you're not sure what it is or how to change it? It can be so maddening to know something has got to change but you can't quite put your finger on it. That was how I used to feel all the time but it didn't make sense. I made good money. Had good friends. I'm smart and loved by my family. I couldn't figure out why I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough. What I learned is that battling your confidence every day and feeling overwhelmed, stressed and out of balance is not normal. Fearless living showed me that. In her Book, Fearless Living, Rhonda Britten teaches people how to master fear. She has created a method for anyone anywhere to master the insidious fear we all have of \u2018not being good enough.\u2019 What she teaches is what she\u2019s lived.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8784070,"name":"L.

FINALLY, a \" Meet Up\" for high functioning young adults living at home or a group home. I am specifically talking about the young people with disabilities that can do so much more socially and want to, but that their socialization some how ends at the programs they attend for various reasons. They do not have friends in the neighborhood, and want to \"fit in\" so badly but don't! Parents, I say ENOUGH, it's got to start with us! Please if you are as frustrated as I am, lets get together, and HELP! Lets help and brainstorm and make this happen! I personally, have a 32 yr old high functioning daughter at home, who is lucky enough to have a 34 yr. old sister who loves and adores her. But as we all know 'its not enough\"! These young people need friends, they need their peers! They need movie dates, bowling dates, parties to attend, or just taking turn hang out at each others house. Parents, as you have already found out the first step to help will always be family. I am looking for dedicated mothers, fathers, sisters , brothers or whoever that family member might consist of. If your plain tired and sad of seeing your grown young adult home alone on the entire weekend with no plans , no friends, or sitting in their room watching a funny movie alone then reach out and lets move forward together. It just begins with one or two of us to start a network of friends for are kids, then before you know it, they are no longer alone!<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/highres_241621249.jpeg","photo_id":241621249,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/member_241621249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/thumb_241621249.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"Socializing For High Functioning Young Adults in Westchester","id":19048902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Socializing-For-High-Functioning-Young-Adults","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"True Friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445457886000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence","id":10538},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"qlikview","name":"Qlikview","id":60832},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-tools-and-technology","name":"Business Intelligence Tools and Technology","id":148287},{"urlkey":"qlik-sense","name":"Qlik Sense","id":1505900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Qlikview-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone utilizing QlikView or&nbsp;Tableau&nbsp;on the BI Platform.

But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute. Yet paid care is out of reach for many. Please come down on November 17th to the New York Life building in Lake Success, NY and attend a free educational workshop on long term care and the many options that are available for us to avoid creating any future hardships for our family members Feel free to contact me for any further information 516-359-8696 Anyone interested in learning about long term care is welcome to join.

Those in the know all know Queens has off-the-hook affordable ethnic eats that are the welcome result of living in the city\u2019s epicenter for cultural diversity. Exploring different ethnic restaurants in Queens and sampling their delicious ethnic foods is a must, whether you live in Queens, in NYC or are just visiting. Eating in an ethnic restaurant is about more than just the food, it\u2019s a cultural experience that gives you a literal taste of life in another land. <\/p>\n<p>If you enjoy dining on good food, meet new people in a fun and relaxed environment, then come join us and together we will eat our way through a cornucopia of exotic cuisines representing all corners of the globe \u2026 all in Queens!<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE at our dining events, we will dine <strong>FAMILY-STYLE<\/strong>, which means we order a variety of dishes and share them, together with sharing the final bill, together with tax and tips.

The Work is a simple yet powerful process of inquiry that teaches you to identify and question the thoughts that cause all the suffering in you and in the world. It\u2019s a way to understand what\u2019s hurting you, and to address the cause of your problems with clarity. In its most basic form, The Work consists of fours questions and the turnarounds. \u201cI discovered that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn't believe them, I didn't suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that. I found that suffering is optional. I found a joy within me that has never disappeared, not for a single moment. That joy is in everyone, always.\u201d \u2014Byron Katie People who do The Work as an ongoing practice commonly report: \u2022 Alleviation of depression: Find resolution, even happiness, in situations that were once debilitating. \u2022 Decreased stress: Live with less anxiety or fear. \u2022 Improved relationships: Experience deeper connection and intimacy with your partner, your parents, your children, your friends, and yourself. \u2022 Reduced anger: Understand what makes you angry and resentful and become reactive less often, with less intensity. \u2022 Increased mental clarity: Live and work more intelligently and effectively, with integrity. \u2022 More energy: Experience a new sense of ongoing vigor and well-being. \u2022 More peace: Discover how to become \u201ca lover of what is.\u201d Ben Henderson is an expert facilitator of The Work. This meetup will help you understand what The Work truly is, and how to use it in your life to dissolve or reduce any stressful thinking that arises in you, whether it be at work, with family, in you love relationships, with your friends, at school, wherever. For sure, I can promise you this, that the evening will be interesting, useful, and even funny at times. It's light and non-confrontational. You will think, really think, about your life in a totally new way without using force, belief or another sytem of thought. Rather, you will use this simple inquiry, gently and slowly, to come to your own answers and resolutions.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","members":41,"name":"NEW YORK BYRON KATIE MEETUP","id":19059819,"state":"NY","urlname":"NEW-YORK-BYRON-KATIE-MEETUP","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Truth Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445796671000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"biracialwmn","name":"Biracial Women","id":3636},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"multicultural","name":"Multicultural","id":16368},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"interracial-relationships","name":"Interracial Relationships","id":25502},{"urlkey":"interracial-singles","name":"Interracial singles","id":25503},{"urlkey":"interracial-dating","name":"Interracial Dating","id":25504},{"urlkey":"african-american-women","name":"African American Women","id":27978},{"urlkey":"multiracial","name":"Multiracial","id":261021}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Hybrid-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In today' world, we see media and external forces tearing down the self-esteem, worth and beauty of women\/men of color.

It's why so many people come here.  \n\nBut usually what happens to us is that in time we stop feeling inspired to do our creative work.  We work hard at our \"day jobs\" thinking we will make time to do our creative work in our free time.  \n\nBut then that begins to peter out.  We are tired, anxious, resentful toward ourselves and the world, wish it could be better, and think,\"If only ...\":  If only I didn't have to work, if only people understood me, if only I weren't so lazy, if only I had more free time, if only my spouse or mate would support me more, if only I were better at what I do, if only I didn't have such a lousy boss ... if only, if only, if only.    \n\nThen it gets more and more complicated, and we get buried in our negative excuses and our inspiration vanishes.  The trick is : How do I keep that inpiration alive?\n\n First ask yourself these questions:\n\nDo you often start creative projects and then give up?\n\nDo you fear if people see or hear your creative work, they will reject it?\u00a0 They will reject you?\n\nIf someone criticizes your work, does it get you down?\n\nIf someone appreciates your creative work, do you think they are being insincere and just trying to flatter you?\n\nDo you tell yourself you don't have the time or energy to do your creative work?\n\nDo you hate being judged as an artist (\"artist\" includes all the arts here)?\n\nAre you your own harshest critic? \n\nDo you think being creative is just too darn hard and that you are not cut out for it?\n\nDo you think you are not talented enough to be successful, not as talented as others,  so why bother?\n\nDo you think you \"have too much going on\" to set aside time to do your creative work?\n\nDo you compare yourself to other creative artists and think you come up short?\n\nDo you yearn to be fully creative but think you just don't have it in you?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any one of these questions, this meetup is for you.  What this meetup teaches you is that all  you need really is insight, true, honest-with-yourself insight.  \n\nThis meetup offers two facets:\n\n1) Inquiry:  We use a powerful method of inquiry to  find the truth about our situation and with that, discover that it is not the situation we are in, but the way we look at it, that causes our stress.  With inquiry, we learn to reduce our negative thinking so that it does not stand in the way between us and having all the creativity in the world available to us.  We start to have that natural enthusiasm  back.  We stop being so self-hating and self-denying and we find the inspiration we need within ourselves.  All this takes is simple inquiry.  So in this part of the meetup we do not get answers from others or what others have read,  or what I know, but within ourselves.  Such insight LASTS.  Why? Because it is YOURS.  Furthermore, I will teach you this from of inquiry so that you can do it on your own, everyday if you wish!\n\nThe second part is the coaching.  Here is where you start to come up with an action plan aligned with your new insights.  This plan is YOURS.  It is not meant to be harsh, burdensome or obligatory.  It must be light and fun.  It must turn you on.  Usually artists lay too much on themselves.  They give themsleves a huge action plan and that becomes burdensome.  I coach you to keep it small,  keep it simple, and see what happens.  Baby steps.  Take baby steps.  Later you can take bigger steps, but I strongly steer people away from overwhelming themselves at the beginning or at any point in their process.  I coach you to stay away from the \"have-to's\" and stick with the \"love-to's.\"  I might make suggestions but I do not give advice.  What you don't need is someone telling you what to do.  You need to find the answers,that natural freedom within yourself and you cannot do that if someone is looking over your shoulder, so to speak.

This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I took a basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen. The cost per guest is will be minimum donation of $40. As I said at the top, there\u2019s going to be delicious food, bottomless drinks, and music, all in a spacious apartment with a large terrace overlooking Central Park \u2013 perfect ingredients for a great time, especially when it\u2019s for a good cause!<\/p>\n<p>Here are some links to the gofundme page I started for Eagle Kindergarten, and Fanel's facebook page for the school:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj\">https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/882495101842616\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/88249510184...<\/a> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, you can take care of the donation when you arrive for the dinner on Saturday, or you can get it out of the way now and I'll take note of which guests have already donated prior to the event.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/highres_444080256.jpeg","photo_id":444080256,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/600_444080256.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/thumb_444080256.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194679069,"name":"David Mazzucchi","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/highres_250877642.jpeg","photo_id":250877642,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/member_250877642.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/thumb_250877642.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"Fundraising dinner for Haitian school","id":19063602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Haiti-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fundraisers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445890957000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"accounting","name":"Accounting","id":378},{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"small-business-accounting","name":"Small Business Accounting","id":27267}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Tax-Accounting-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group will aid small business owners, self-employed individuals and those looking to venture out onto their own in learning fundamental Finance, Accounting and Tax concepts with the aid of skilled designated professionals.

Experience the rush and excitement of one of the fastest growing extreme winter water sports. Swimmers will learn proper safety guidelines, cold water adaptation, swimming techniques and recovery (i.e. post swim warm-up) tips. For the swim, all you need are a bathing suit, goggles, swim cap (silicone preferable) and ear plugs. ABSOLUTELY NO WETSUITS. For after the swim, please have a towel, some very warm clothes and shoes. A thermos of hot tea and some food helps aid recovery! PRIOR SWIMMING ABILITY REQUIRED. [Please note Winter Swimming is not akin to the 'Polar Bear Club'. We will be swimming and spending time in the water and not jumping in or 'plunging'. As always, swimmer safety is paramount.]","lon":-73.9300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/7\/9\/highres_443549561.jpeg","photo_id":443549561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/7\/9\/600_443549561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/7\/9\/thumb_443549561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":53321862,"name":"Melissa 'Mo' O'Reilly","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/b\/highres_250917659.jpeg","photo_id":250917659,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/b\/member_250917659.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/b\/thumb_250917659.jpeg"}},"members":47,"name":"Winter Swimming","id":19066918,"state":"NY","urlname":"Winter-Swimming","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Swimmers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445977392000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoruba","name":"Yoruba Language","id":1140},{"urlkey":"religion","name":"Religion","id":8231},{"urlkey":"ifa","name":"Ifa Religion","id":9567},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"religione-ifa","name":"Religione Ifa","id":14028},{"urlkey":"african-culture","name":"African Culture","id":35648},{"urlkey":"orisa-religion","name":"Orisa Religion","id":45780},{"urlkey":"ifa-community","name":"Ifa Community","id":67551},{"urlkey":"orisa-community","name":"Orisa Community","id":67552},{"urlkey":"yoruba-spirituality","name":"Yoruba Spirituality","id":697912}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Ifa-Religion-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in Ifa, Orisa, traditional religion, spirituality, African culture, God in Yoruba belief system.

With as little struggle and as much fun as you would if you were placing an order and selecting what you wanted from a catalog?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yes you are, and yes you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The truth is <\/b>that the voice within you, the one that\u2019s always known and the one that\u2019s always guiding you - perhaps even to these words right now - is right. The road to whatever transformation you are in search of is an ACCELERATED one- or it can be given the right mentor and the right tools. From my heart to yours, I invite you to experience first-hand how accelerated the transformation that\u2019s been calling you can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>I decided to start this group<\/b> because as a master coach and successful entrepreneur, I notice so many people (including myself at one point in time) in what I call the \u201chamster wheel\u201d of never achieving their goals, where it seems to them that they never will or worse that their experience of getting there is such a struggle that they rob themselves from the joy of the process. It hurts me to see this as so many people's experience, just as much as it hurt me to experience it once myself... and it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The purpose of this meet up is <\/b>for you to discover and uncover what within you is truly holding you back and be given the tools on how to transform that in the most accelerated way. I'll be sharing a way for you to literally shift your existing reality to the one you desire - immediately. I'm sure you\u2019ve heard that many times before, but the difference this time is that I\u2019m not \"just saying this to you\"\u2026 I\u2019m <b>claiming<\/b> this <b>for you <\/b>and inviting you to claim this for yourself<b>.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What gives me the right<\/b> to claim that? Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve DONE with my own life and now it's what I so deeply want for yours. Earlier this year, it was my own voice within that guided me to receiving these tools from my mentor which ended up being THE biggest quantum shift of my life - I tell you, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is beating so fast with the truth that I do not even recognize myself! It is from this place that a fire within me exists to personally guide you to through your own experience of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The very tools that I was given to use for my own accelerated evolution are the very tools that you are being offered right now. I invite you to come find out what those are! Talk is cheap and your personal experience of what I\u2019m sharing with you is stronger than any of my words. Once you get to know me, you\u2019ll learn that I\u2019m not about the fluff, but rather the real \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d to arrive at the transformation you\u2019re looking for... and it's my greatest fulfillment to provide that for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Therefore, these meet-ups are FREE<\/b>\u2026 you have nothing to lose and more than you could ever imagine to gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>So, are you ready?

Maayyybe... You sit up at night thinking, \"What IS Grand Moff Tarkin's story.. I wonder what his childhood was like. Where did the 'rule of two' come from anyway, who is this Darth Bane guy? Do I love or hate Revan? Qui-Gon Jinn left us too soon, I want more.\" Well fear not my fellow Padawan Reader, because this book club will answer all of your questions! Join me, and I will complete your training... I mean... It'll be a fun club. We'll pick the books together.

So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience.

Tired of getting up at 4:30am to catch a bus for an overpriced day trip to Windham or Hunter? Problem solved! Let's carpool from the Westchester\/Rockland\/Lower Fairfield area for a casual day trip to Windham or Hunter. Let's leave at 9am and get a half-day ticket. Or ski a full day and still leave at 8am! Both ski areas are just over 2 hrs from the Westchester area and provide enough variety on the slope or off the slopes. No need to rush home after a day of skiing.......let's listen to some music in the lodge and relax before heading out. The goal of this group is to have meetups at local Westchester bars so we can meet other ski buddies and arrange carpools so we can all ski together. And also to have a drink or 2! If you're into hanging out at the lodge, thats cool too....no need to be a skier. For those with weekend houses in the Windham\/Hunter area, this is a great way to meet other skiers to ski with from the Westchester area.<\/p>","lon":-73.7600021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":195341404,"name":"Kim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/8\/3\/highres_251261091.jpeg","photo_id":251261091,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/8\/3\/member_251261091.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/8\/3\/thumb_251261091.jpeg"}},"members":112,"name":"Skiers Over 40 - Day Trips to Windham\/Hunter-Let's Carpool!","id":19106252,"state":"NY","urlname":"Skiers-Over-40-Day-Trips-to-Windham-Hunter-Lets-Carpool","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":41.0299987793,"who":"Skiers\/Riders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Yonkers","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447110989000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"skiing","name":"Skiing","id":2294},{"urlkey":"ccskiing","name":"Cross-Country Skiing","id":3490},{"urlkey":"snowshoeing","name":"Snowshoeing","id":6696},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"trail-riding","name":"trail riding","id":28002},{"urlkey":"cycling-for-fitness","name":"Cycling for Fitness","id":58196},{"urlkey":"golfing","name":"Golf","id":102894}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/All-County-Social-Cycling-club-Of-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>&nbsp;When first signing up for ID purpose please provide a photo of yourself&nbsp;in your profile thank you.

This encompasses scrabble play with clocks, challenges and no looking in the dictionary before you play a word. I have enough equipment for four players or two games. The idea of this meetup is an alternative from playing scrabble online. When people play online there is no supervision so you don't know if the game is legitimate or not. The rules: 25:00 in a standard scrabble game for each opponent. If you go over your clock a minute you are penalized ten points even if it is one second. This event will be held at the Greenhouse Cafe at 7717 3rd Ave Brooklyn NY 11209 7-10:30 pm alternate Tuesdays. Directions are the R train to 77th street and walk one block south to third avenue.

I started this group to help women entrepreneurs be supported by one another, to connect, learn, grow and be in a community that builds confidence to help you step into your power and claim your self-worth so that you can do the work that you love and be of service to others AND be able to financially support yourself and your lifestyle of choice without sacrificing your own wellbeing in the process. Whether you are a long time business owner or just starting out, working for yourself, can be a very lonely and sometimes a little scary. We don't always know all the right things to do and we are often afraid, ashamed or too stubborn to ask for help. By nature, we are passionate, giving, independent and creative. A community of like-minded women going for it in their lives and businesses is a force to be reckoned with. When we take out the competitive mindset and instead trust that there is success for each of us, that rising tide lifts all ships.

This proved to be a difficult, if not impossible, task! I have formed this meetup social to bring together gay men from the area who share my passion. We will mostly taste and discuss green, white, oolong, black and puer teas from China, Taiwan, Japan and India. Our group will visit tea houses, tea events and perhaps once we get to know each other have tea sociasl at each others homes. Members' suggestions and participation is encouraged in order to keep it interesting.

Non-restaurant events are usually hosted in one of our apartments - typically in Brooklyn by the Barclays Center but any member can offer to host.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/9\/8\/highres_444265496.jpeg","photo_id":444265496,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/9\/8\/600_444265496.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/9\/8\/thumb_444265496.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":27257072,"name":"Rachel Ostrowski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/8\/highres_251370552.jpeg","photo_id":251370552,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/8\/member_251370552.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/8\/thumb_251370552.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"NYC Wine Club Meetup","id":19118736,"state":"NY","urlname":"Wine-Club-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Wine Club Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447445750000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-having-fun","name":"Girls having fun","id":15413},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Cool-Fun-Chicks-Hang-Out\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a weekly meet up group for any lady who is nice, cool, fun and into being supportive of other women around her.

How might we create in-real-life buttons that create digital trails? This is a group for product designers, experimenters and people interested in the intersection between physical and digital things to come together and prototype ideas quickly. We'll host workshops around design challenges so you can make time for experimentation and play outside of work. Design challenges we might try:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Create something that fixes an annoying problem you face every day. <br>\u2022 Create something that makes your favorite app come to life. <br>\u2022 Create something that makes people laugh <br>\u2022 Create something to help strangers start talking to each other. <br>\u2022 Create something that replaces the last thing you threw away yesterday.<\/p>\n<p><span>We\u2019ll use kits from LittleBits<\/span><span>\u2122<\/span><span>\u2014 <\/span><span>inputs like the Button, Motion Trigger and slide dimmer, connect with the CloudBit and IFTTT to make your offline buttons come to life.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is LittleBits\u2122?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>littleBits is a platform of easy-to-use electronic building blocks that empower you to invent anything, from your own remote controlled car, to a smart home device.

This meetup group is to help organize and mobilize volunteers who want to help manage Bareburger locations, help with the final delivery, get your own local community involved, etc. Join us and feel great about helping women this Holiday Season!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":66615162,"name":"Verunka Vlkova-Fierro","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/a\/b\/highres_250762955.jpeg","photo_id":250762955,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/a\/b\/member_250762955.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/a\/b\/thumb_250762955.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"New York City Shoebox Project Meetup","id":19127139,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Shoebox-Project-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Shoebox Project Volunteers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447690879000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"figuredrawing","name":"Figure Drawing","id":2784},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"sketching","name":"Sketching","id":16783},{"urlkey":"models-for-figure-drawing","name":"Models for Figure Drawing","id":19349},{"urlkey":"draw","name":"Drawing","id":20805},{"urlkey":"life-drawing","name":"Life Drawing","id":23981},{"urlkey":"free-hand-drawing","name":"Free-hand Drawing","id":30076},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"fine-art-drawing","name":"Fine Art Drawing","id":59449},{"urlkey":"charcoal-drawing","name":"Charcoal Drawing","id":67460},{"urlkey":"drawing-from-the-model","name":"Drawing from the Model","id":87468},{"urlkey":"life-figure-drawing","name":"Life Figure Drawing","id":105191}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Life-Drawing-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a 3 hour drawing session, that allows anyone interested in drawing a live model, to practice their craft!

National Women's Liberation (NWL) is a new feminist group with old roots. The organization was born from a collaboration between organizers from Redstockings and Gainesville Women's Liberation (FL) which started in 1968. We are a dynamic and diverse group of women in the fight against male supremacy, developing theory alongside our actions. An integral part of our organization is the Women of Color Caucus (WOCC) which meets separately from white women to better understand how white supremacy intersects with other forms of oppression. Our group hosts public meetings the third Tuesday of every month at The Commons at 388 Atlantic Ave, and all women are welcome. <br><\/p>\n<p>NWL won a big victory in 2013 when the Morning-After Pill was put over the counter for all ages, the fruits of a 10-year battle that included a sit-in at the FDA, illegally giving out the pill to show the ridiculousness of the restrictions, and a class action lawsuit. Current priorities are the right to abortion and birth control and the overthrow of the double day--women's roles as full-time caretakers and full time employees. Most recently, we printed and distributed 1969 \"This Oppresses Women\" stickers after reviving them from the Redstockings Archive. We got a lot of publicity when they were used against Protein World's Beach Body ads in Union Square, and they continue to appear on other offending ads all over the city. NWL feminists are also organizing the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign in NYC. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are a group for women who want to fight back against male supremacy and win more freedom for women. We believe that change comes about from the actions of everyday people\u2014not politicians, the courts, lobbyists, or the media. The freedoms we have now were won by movements of women, organizing and fighting for change. Men did not become less sexist or decide to give women the vote or legalize birth control because of our individual abilities to reason with them, educate them, or because they love us so much. The inequalities between women and men are political problems that require a collective solution.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Check out womensliberation.org to get involved. <br><\/p>\n<p>Unless specifically noted, all events are for women only.

This became apparent during our first Zmission. It was truly a humbling and eye-opening experience. As we sat together in fellowship after traveling thousands of miles, we realized that we were there to Serve in any way needed and without judgment. Guidance came in the form of wise council trusting in God and seeking his word. To feel the power of God, let go and trust in him and your life will be transformed. Jesus shows up in our lives in powerful ways and guides us along our journeys<\/p>\n<p>What We Can Do to Serve<br>There are many ways TO SERVE communities around the world and gives new found hope to people who may not have had hope before through Christ. This means bringing groups together to transform lives and opening minds to new realities by embodying the unconditional love of Jesus. It also means we are never above the communities and individuals we serve. No task is to small. We will serve around the world where there is need and you will impact the world in a positive way while making a difference in thousands of people lives along the way.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll Know What To Do When You Get There<br>Where God leads you next, and the blessings he will bestow will absolutely blow your mind.

Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>Zmissions Team<br>Jon Christian \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>God began taping me on the shoulder at an early age. I remember it like it was yesterday. I\u201dd always been naturally rebellious and found it hard to accept what was taught at Sunday school. Sound Familiar? At the age of about 7, I realized there was something missing while sitting in Church services. I felt like God had a bigger plan. A plan for me to SERVE!<\/p>\n<p>Years passed while my searched continued for connection, purpose, and impact until the day my perspective was changed forever\u2026 at my feet written as clear as the day was\u2026\u201dJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d. That was the day I was CALLED SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>I found myself standing on the farthest rock in the ocean I could find. I\u2019d been traveling for miles with 50 lbs. of gear and had not seen my family in two months. As the sun began to set the sky had lit up like fire. The contrast between the blue ocean and the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was as if God himself was staring back at me looking deep within my soul. My hair began to stand up the same way it had when I found \u201cJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d written in concrete so many years before. A voice from within, not the voice you hear from internal conversations you have in your head on a normal day, this was all encompassing vibrating energy coming from both outside and within, it was coming from my heart and the entire world around me. The words spoken to me were \u201cWELL DONE, YOU MADE IT\u2026NOW GO AND TELL THE WORLD.<\/p>\n<p>The adventures and the journey are long, hard, and sometimes painful, but also transformational, rewarding, and have brought much joy and fulfillment in my life. I continue to push my limits, praying \u201cJESUS CHRIST MY LORD AND GOD IN YOU I PUT MY TRUST\u201d Through all the chaos and adventure, and a chance meeting with my Guardian Angel who taught me what unconditional love is I had found what I had been looking for since the age of 7. These experiences have absolutely transformed my life and outlook but most importantly by putting my faith in Jesus and believing he could provide everything and more that we needed I experienced a level of living a life that many only dream about.<\/p>\n<p>Where God lead me next, and the blessings he bestowed on me to this day absolutely blow my mind. Where ever we go, what ever we do, when we get there we do what is needed Period. All you have to do is show up and the big man above will handle the rest. What will you do next? Did you feel it? Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>After a long and sometimes lonely journey, I\u2019ve found wise counsel and fellowship in Christ. Now it\u2019s your turn, we climb this mountain and embark on the adventure together.<\/p>\n<p>John Albino \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>John Albino started Absolute Music Studios with one goal in mind\u2026 to create a warm and inviting musical atmosphere that he himself would want to come to. It all started with the desire to live a more community-oriented life and to be around to raise his children instead of living on the road, which he did for many years. John has worked with musicians from many of the biggest names in the music business over the years, including KISS, The Pretenders, Wings, Billy Joel, Foreigner, Pat Travers and Quiet Riot, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>He has also worked as a studio musician, playing on sessions with many top producers including Stephen Gelfas and Charlie Midnight.<br>Now he has created a first class music studio staffed with the best player-teachers in the area. He brings decades of musical expertise and the benefit of years of front-line professional experience to Absolute Music, his own unique creation. Using that experience as a musician and a vision to guide him, he set out to build a studio where many could come and pursue their passion for music in a warm and inviting family-oriented atmosphere, while being taught by the finest teachers available. Absolute Music is now firmly established as one of the best and busiest music lesson studios in the area. John\u2019s continual dedication to and involvement with the surrounding communities plays a crucial role in his success, while also providing community enrichment through music.<\/p>","lon":-74.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/highres_444267699.jpeg","photo_id":444267699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/600_444267699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/thumb_444267699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192504993,"name":"Jon Christian","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/highres_251458961.jpeg","photo_id":251458961,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/member_251458961.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/thumb_251458961.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"Zmissions Christian Adventure Missions Group Hazlet, NJ","id":19129064,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Zmissions-Christian-Adventure-Missions-Meetup-Hazlet-NJ","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.4199981689,"who":"ZMission Warriors For The People"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447729458000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"happiness","name":"Happiness","id":16481},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-care","name":"Self-Care","id":27818},{"urlkey":"creating-a-healthy-relationship-to-food","name":"Creating a Healthy Relationship to Food","id":36824},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897},{"urlkey":"mindful-and-intuitive-eating","name":"Mindful and Intuitive Eating","id":118995}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nourish-Mind-and-Body\/","rating":0,"description":"This group provides a safe space to explore how yoga and mindfulness can help make a difference in your life, reduce stress, start living in the present moment and lead to better self-care. I am Diana S. Ramos, a Registered Dietitian\/Nutritionist and yoga instructor. I practice a mind-body approach to nutrition and well-being, and empower each individual to develop a healthy relationship with their bodies, mind and food. My mission is to help individuals thrive into a more joyful, healthy and mindful lives. I discovered the real benefits of yoga in the most difficult times in my life. I was at my peak levels of stress, anxiety and unhappiness. Yoga helped me find peace within myself. Through the practice of yoga I discovered that stress, anxiety and unhappiness were rooted from not living and accepting the present moment. I noticed I was either in living in the past or worrying about the future, but never present moment, in what is. Yoga helped me to kindly move into the present moment, decrease self-judgement, and cultivate self-compassion, self-love and self-acceptance. I would like to share this experience and practice with you. This group offers yoga and wellness workshops, to help you dive into the present moment, release stress and anxiety, and help you to compassionately take care of you. Allow yoga to help you connect with your body. Yoga is not about how flexible you are but how flexible you can become on your mat and in real life with you and your thoughts. Yoga is not about competing, comparing, or judging, it is about self-acceptance, self-love and self-compassion. Yoga is a practice where no experience necessary. The only requirement is you and an open mind. This is an invitation to take care of your body and mind. My Motto: Embrace. Love. Nurture. Embrace who you are. Love yourself just as you are. In order to Nurture yourself the right way.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194388034,"name":"Diana Ramos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/highres_250709693.jpeg","photo_id":250709693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/member_250709693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/thumb_250709693.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Nourish Body & Mind","id":19129142,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nourish-Mind-and-Body","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Body-Mind Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447736862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"productdesign","name":"Product Design","id":2993},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"business-ideas","name":"Business Ideas","id":15928},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"ideas","name":"ideas","id":49075}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Creative-Lab\/","rating":0,"description":"The Creative Lab is a place for people to exercise their creativity.

We want to meet at least once a week, to speak of Jesus Christ and the Scriptures, to pray together, to continue in the apostles teachings and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread.\n\nIt is written, there is one who scatters, yet increases more; and there is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty. This group is to \"scatter\" the word of God, to give free course to the Scriptures. As long as we are willing to rightly divide the word of truth, every man and woman has a part in the conversation. We can edify each other in love. I put one block of truth, and you can put another block of truth.\n\nYou can expect to be part of a spiritual conversation, and the opportunity to exercise your spiritual gifts as long as we do all things decently and in order. When we come together, every single member has. One has a psalm, another a doctrine, someone else a tongue, another one a revelation, the next man an interpretation. Let all things be done for edifying of the body of Christ.\n\nThe Gospel\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God unto the meek, liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, the proclamation of the day of salvation, the acceptable year of the Lord (Isa 52:6-7, 61:1-2, Luk 4:18-19, 8:1); whereby God sent and anointed his son Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel and to be the saviour of the world. (1 Jn 4:14) The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes whether Jew or Greek (Rom 1:16-17) to all them that call upon him (Rom 10:12-15). For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  The Gospel declares that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, he was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures, that he was seen of Cephas, the twelve and then of five hundred brethren at once. (1 Cor 15:1-3) Through the Gospel we understand that that the stone which was rejected is become the head of the corner.  Jesus Christ who was rejected and crucified rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and is now exalted far above all principalities and powers (Ps 118:22-23, Mat 21:42, Acts 4:10-12, 1 Cor 15:1-3, Eph 1:20-21). This tried stone is none other than Jesus Christ; whose name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isa 7:10-14, Mat 1:21-23; Is 8:10-18, 9:6-7; 1 Pet 2:4-8). This is the true God and eternal life (1 Jn 5:20).\n\nAn essential part of the gospel is understanding what it means that Jesus is the Christ.  It is written, that He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God did not give the Spirit by measure unto Him (Jn 3:34). This verse speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, a body that God prepared, so that the fullness of the Father would be manifested in him (Heb 10:5). As the Scripture says, For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col 1:19).  This is the mystery of Christ, even the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory (1Ti 3:16). He that sees Jesus, sees Him that sent him (Jn 12:45). This is to the mind that has understanding. The name of the Father is Jesus. The name of the Son is Jesus. The name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus. These are spiritual words, and they owe to be discerned spiritually. This is what Jesus meant, when he said that he was the Son of God. For since the very beginning it was written, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness (Gen 1:16). Jesus Christ is that man, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature (Col 1:15). God was in Christ, and not another. I repeat again, Christ received the Spirit of God without measure. The prophet Isaiah foresaw this and speaking as the oracles of God wrote that a child will be born unto us, that a son will be given. And that his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father. We are also called to be partakers of such fullness, to come in the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to grow unto that perfect man, unto the measure and stature of Christ (Eph 4:13). We are also called to receive the Spirit of Christ. God will give us the Holy Ghost if we obey Him (Acts 5:32). Men and brethren, what must we do in order to obey God?\n\nJesus Christ came preaching repentance and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat 4:17). In order to enter into the kingdom of God we must be born again of the water and of the Spirit (Jn 3:3-5). Those early disciples in the book of Acts were born again when they repented, were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (born of the water), and received the infilling of the Holy Ghost (born of the Spirit). (Acts 2:37-41, 8:12-17, 9:17-18, 10:44-48, 19:1-6) The baptisms in the book of Acts were done in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 4:12, 8:12, 10:48, 19:5, Gal 3:27, Rom 6:3-4, Col 2:12). In order to obey the Gospel and enter into the kingdom of God we too must do what those early disciples did and what Jesus commanded. Repent therefore, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you too shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38-39). Please take the time to look up the scriptures listed in this study (Acts 17:11).","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":182770744,"name":"Andy Rodriguez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/highres_241877221.jpeg","photo_id":241877221,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/member_241877221.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/thumb_241877221.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Church In Manhattan","id":19136615,"state":"NY","urlname":"Church-In-Manhattan","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Christians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447943628000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"motion-graphics","name":"Motion Graphics","id":19344},{"urlkey":"final-cut-pro","name":"Final Cut Pro","id":19965},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"3d-animation","name":"3D Animation","id":25718},{"urlkey":"compositing","name":"Compositing","id":29130},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"vfx","name":"VFX","id":30988},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"visual-effects-cg-animation","name":"Visual Effects CG Animation","id":70655},{"urlkey":"post-production-editing-visual-effects-vfx","name":"POST-PRODUCTION: EDITING & Visual Effects VFX","id":468552},{"urlkey":"animation-and-visual-effects","name":"Animation and visual effects","id":1250832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/postproductionworkshops\/","rating":0,"description":"Live workshops and user group meetings on making workflow with FCPX, DaVinci Resolve, Fusion, Smoke and a bunch of other stuff.

How can you pay rent in this expensive city from doing what you love instead of what you love to do being the thing that you are moonlighting with.  It's time for a breakthrough, a better business strategy, more \"Benjamins\" and better Bottom Line. \n\n8 years ago, I decided to stop doing the things that I hate and start doing what I love. I became a full-time fitness professional: personal trainer, group exercise instructor and yoga instructor.  I was penniless more often than not, until I stopped competing for gigs and started creating my own lane. This meet-up is for 1) the fitness professionals that are creating their own lane, making money doing what they love, living the yogi life without compromise and 2) those that dreaming\/wishing\/waiting to be financial independent from their \"day jobs\" to do their \"life's work\". \n\nLets meet for networking; let's meet for strategy sessions; let's meet for website review; let's meet for marketing tips; let's meet to find your desire map; let's meet to talk niche and strategic allies; lets talk about having your Om-Grown Business!
