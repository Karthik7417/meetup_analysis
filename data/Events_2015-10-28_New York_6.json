What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.

When this response arises too frequently or intensely and doesn't match actual situations of danger, it can interfere with life and cause great distress. While every person experiences anxiety, it is estimated that over a quarter of the population will experience anxiety at levels that cause distress in their lives.

We live (in the Twitter-loin) in San Francisco, California.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/myaccount.maestroconference.com\/conference\/register\/WT2YUZOM3UBHJAAX\">Register Now\u00a0<\/a>\u2013 telephone lines are limited on the call.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/myaccount.maestroconference.com\/conference\/register\/WT2YUZOM3UBHJAAX\"><a href=\"http:\/\/myaccount.maestroconference.com\/conference\/register\/WT2YUZOM3UBHJAAX\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/myaccount.maestroconference.com\/conference\/register\/WT2YUZOM3UBHJAAX<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Singles-Adventure-Trips-40\/events\/225568889\/","yes_rsvp_count":57,"name":"Phone Party For Single Women Only (FREE!)","id":"225568889","time":1444784400000,"updated":1444796723000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1312054648000,"name":"40s & 50s Singles Events and Adventures","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":2263471,"urlname":"Singles-Adventure-Trips-40","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Adventure Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"West Hempstead","address_1":"7 Terminal Rd","name":"Storm Sports Academy","lon":-73.657768,"id":19209752,"state":"NY","lat":40.707909,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":11,"distance":17.6725730896,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442878565000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tuesday nights are back!!!

And his dramatic monologues do explore the male mental field more often than the female -- which we usually see, anyway, through the lens of the male. But a further look reveals that Browning's men place a heavy value on the importance of women in the world. For one thing, women furnish standards of taste, beauty, and [male ideals of] moral propriety. In that way, they sometimes can offer stability and coherence. But they are also a sexual resource, which [men may think] threatens stability. That conflict, or potential conflict, may be what fuels the frequent violence against women in Browning. Anxiety over female freedom, over the inability to control what women are and mean, think and do, can drive men to take steps to correct the matter. We could ask: is this anxiety something Browning himself is conjuring with, or is it something that, as a dramatist, he, as literary observer, takes as part of the field he surveys and depicts? Good question! Come on out to the beautiful National Arts Club and join us for this exciting lecture.

Adventures of Reinforcement Learning in the Real World<br\/>Wednesday, October 14, 2015<br\/>Speaker: Yael Niv<br\/>4:15PM Tea; 5:00PM Lecture<\/p> <p>Animals and humans alike can quickly learn to associate different stimuli in the environment with rewards or punishments. In recent years, ideas from the computational field of reinforcement learning have revolutionized the study of learning in the brain, providing new, precise theories of how such associations are formed. However, although these learning algorithms work well in simplified laboratory scenarios, they are known to suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality\" that makes learning in complex, multidimensional scenarios infeasible. How does the brain scale reinforcement learning to realistic tasks?<\/p> <p>In this lecture, Dr. Yael Niv will argue that the key to learning efficiently in real-world scenarios is to use a simplified representation of the task that includes only those dimensions of the environment that are relevant to obtaining reward. This, however, raises the new question of how such task representations are learned. Dr. Niv will first demonstrate, using behavioral experiments, that animals and humans learn the causal, often hidden structure of a task, thus forming a concise task representation through experience. She will then suggest that these task representations reside in the orbitofrontal cortex, and show how we can visualize these mental maps of task space and how these maps are related to behavioral performance.<\/p> <p>Dr. Niv is associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University.

Reality Crowd TV helps entrepreneurs with a variety of efforts like crowdfunding including helping to provide a blueprint on how to crowdfund. Since starting Reality Crowd TV Media Corporation, Manolis has helped 10 companies raise $825,000 (as of 12\/31\/14).<\/p> <p><br\/>His ability to do so has come from his social media business development skillset coupled with access to journalists and bloggers across industries who are interested in writing about innovative startup companies at the early stages of development.<\/p> <p><br\/>Manolis also helps manage social media and communities for larger organizations, growing their user base and sales via online media business development. As the community manager of Patch of Land, over $700,000 in gross revenues have been converted to date via his efforts on social media, an enormous return on investment considering the cost of those services accounted for less than 5% of the funds raised.<\/p> <p><br\/>Manolis understands quickly what needs to be done to take a business to the next level, even if he had not had previous experience within a certain industry. His consultative approach to understanding a business allows both client and consultant to come up with innovative new ways to get the word out about a company and their products or services. He has become a universal marketer and through his network of partners, can achieve virtually any result across mediums per the request of the client.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/social-marketing-crowdfunding-for-real-estate-investors-tickets-18176678936\">JOIN US!<\/a>\u00a0<\/b>Remember to use PROMO Code<b> PATCH100 <\/b>for free admission and please call[masked] with any questions.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Use PROMO Code PATCH100 at https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/social-marketing-crowdfunding-for-real-estate-investors-tickets-18176678936","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Real-Estate-Crowdfunding-Education-Networking-NYC\/events\/225990722\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":12600000,"name":"Social Marketing & Crowdfunding for Real Estate Investors","id":"225990722","time":1444860000000,"updated":1444874553000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424613752000,"name":"Real Estate Crowdfunding Education & Networking NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18452543,"urlname":"Real-Estate-Crowdfunding-Education-Networking-NYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Real Estate Crowdfund Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"230 Park Ave Ste 600","name":"Lee Hecht Harrison","lon":-73.975937,"id":23470051,"lat":40.754688,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.805774867535,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443105026000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Coaches.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'm attending the October ICF-NYC event.

While this event is geared toward singles, We don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with) and possibly even end up meeting that special someone.<\/p> <p><br\/>Typically about 80% of attendees of this event come alone and 20% bring a friend. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<br\/><b><br\/><i>Oh - here's a quick note to the men. Guys... this event has been called, \"A secret gem. One of the best places to meet fun, quality women in NYC\". So fellas, if you really want to meet a great woman, ditch the online dating scene and head on out to a painting night!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>TICKET PRICE: $37<br\/>Get your tickets at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speedpainting.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speedpainting.html<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>PICS FROM RECENT EVENTS: <\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/4\/2\/600_442739458.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Get your tickets at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speedpainting.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speedpainting.html<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Saturday-Night-Singles-NYC\/events\/225852370\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":7200000,"name":"Speed Painting Night - Paint, Socialize, Make New Friends!

In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true- all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work.

There's a long series of steps that we need to take before we get there, and now, we're entering the first stage: applying for 501(c)(3) status to be officially recognized as a non-profit religious organization. Step 1: Raise money for the 501(c)(3) application fee. Here's where you come in!<\/p> <p>If you like cheap and delicious food (especially waffle fries), meeting and chatting with like-minded Witches \/ Pagans \/ followers of the Goddess, and helping make the dream of a physical temple a reality, come to our Fundraiser Planning Meeting! We're meeting at the Monarch Diner in Wayne, NJ next Wednesday, October 14th. We'll get to know each other over milkshakes, cheese fries, and the other glories of NJ diners, with the goal of planning a fundraiser for the 501(c)(3) fee that we can implement immediately. We want to raise the money in time to meet the January application deadline, so let's make this happen!<\/p> <p>All comers welcome! If you can't make the meeting but you want to contribute ideas, message me. If this is your first time joining one of our Meetups and you're nervous, don't be! We are all here to do Her work.

Hailed as \"distinctive and free of affect or artifice\" by the A.V. Club, her Great-Plains-gothic style \"lands somewhere between Scout Niblett and Karen Dalton, writing about land and space and hope and despair\" (Nightlight). Schrag now lives in New York and is hard at work on her third record. Her current band includes guitarist Bob Bannister, bassist Debby Schwartz, and Schrag's longtime collaborator, Gary Foster, on drums, with occasional guests Susan Alcorn (pedal steel) and Concetta Abbate (violin).<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.emberschrag.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.emberschrag.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>RSVP and like us here to keep in touch and support queer\/women artists! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/723307587798109\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/723307587798109\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LGBT-History-and-Culture\/events\/225848767\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Fabulous October Songbird Series- with Lianne Smith and Ember Schragg","id":"225848767","time":1444863600000,"updated":1444876385000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286895187000,"name":"LGBT History and Culture","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1720782,"urlname":"LGBT-History-and-Culture","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"33 E 17th St, 3rd Floor Starbucks","name":"Barnes and Noble","lon":-74.005943,"id":24095969,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442846984000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone, let's get together to meet one another and talk about the work we've done and how we can collaborate with each other in the future.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Film-and-Video-Production-Meetup\/events\/225509403\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Networking and Showcasing your Work","id":"225509403","time":1444863600000,"updated":1444932934000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440080991000,"name":"New York Film and Video Production Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":18851573,"urlname":"New-York-Film-and-Video-Production-Meetup","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10543","country":"us","city":"Mamaroneck","address_1":"822 Mamaroneck Avenue","name":"Modern Myths New York","lon":-73.737961,"id":8595572,"state":"NY","lat":40.95742,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.5044116974,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1407219121000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/img.4plebs.org\/boards\/tg\/image\/1390\/31\/1390314139445.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us for an ongoing weekly game of the new version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons!<\/p> <p>NO previous experience is required to play.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Let\u2019s explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.

Despite massive public outcry and several attempts by the HSUS-led coalition to contact NYBC, the center continues to deny responsibility for the chimpanzees.

In 2006, October 15th was named Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. At 7pm in every time zone on October 15th, surviving families across the world light a candle in remembrance of the litte ones they've lost. Knot My Baby will follow suit by having a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge and a candle lighting to conclude the ceremony. Arrive at the Park Row Subway Plaza entrance of City Hall Park in Manhattan, NY at 5:00pm on Thursday, October 15th, 2015 to complete registration. General park address in 31 Chambers Street, Ny, NY 10007. Visit www.NYCGovParks.org\/parks\/city-hall-park to familiarize yourself with the actual entrance we will be meeting at. We will promptly start our walk over the Brooklyn Bridge at 6:00pm and end at McLaughlin Park, located at 243 Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201 between Tillary Street and Catherdral Place to light the flameless candles provided by Knot My Baby at 7pm. If you arrive after we have left, feel free to continue across the bridge as we will be walking slowly and taking pictures as we reach the midway point of the bridge.<\/p> <p>Thereafter, participants are encouraged but not required to join us for dinner at AppleBee's located at 395 Flatbush Avenue Extension, Metro Tech, Brooklyn, NY 11201 directly after for their dine and donate program.

Off the coast of Taiji Japan, free, migrating dolphins are ambushed at sea and driven by a fleet of boats to a once secret cove, where they're captured for the theme park industry and slaughtered for food. This is featured in the Oscar-winning documentary, \"The Cove.\" Join Michael Mah as he shares his travels with Sea Shepherd which is committed to bringing the world's attention to stop this practice. Hear how environmental conservation teams 1) channel a powerful sense of purpose, 2) practice leadership, 3) use social media, 4) create transparency, 5) build trust, and 6) use metrics and data to command the world's attention. Hear Michael's take on what passionate teams muster to move a needle towards a \"tipping point,\" and lessons that your software teams can learn from activist teams in the global environmental conservation movement to bring the quality of their work to new heights.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker:\u00a0<\/b>Michael Mah is managing partner at QSM Associates Inc.

The faces of those children are alight with wonder, with puzzlement, with interest, and yes, with joy. When I imagine students in many of today's classrooms, that image is often static. Locked into a system of learning that too often becomes habitual, the faces of many young people in our schools register boredom, disinterest, or resignation to their fate.<\/p> <p>Early in my teaching career, I recognized my need to guide the educational development of young people in ways that didn't, at the same time, take the joy out of their lives. I reasoned that my classroom environment must effectively support the natural ways in which children learn.<\/p> <p>In the mid-80s, after taking numerous postgraduate courses in the neurosciences, I worked to bridge the gap between emerging knowledge of the brain and the practices of education. Eventually, I shared the ideas with other teachers in workshops entitled \"Learning from the Inside Out.\" At the close of each workshop, I asked participants to comment on the ideas they had found the most valuable. To my surprise, rather than choosing what they had learned about students, most of the teachers commented on how much they had learned about themselves!<\/p> <p>Their comments made me realize the extent to which teachers are ignored in educational planning, except as purveyors of content chosen by others. Yet the beliefs and values that provide the unconscious foundation for teacher behavior, the metaphors that set the stages of their classrooms, and the mental models of the world through which they conceptualize their work, are highly individualistic. Rather than the constants they are often assumed to be, numerous studies suggest that the teacher may well be the most influential variable in the educational equation!<\/p> <p>Substantive change in education is unlikely to occur until educators understand how each teacher's beliefs about the nature of teaching and learning, and the metaphors they use to describe their teaching, influence everything that occurs in the classroom. Teaching in Mind: How Teacher Thinking Shapes Education examines those issues and more. In its pages, I will encourage you to probe the realms of subjective experience\u2014the beliefs, values, presuppositions, and metaphors that shape your personal world.<\/p> <p>The very word subjective makes some researchers in the social sciences cringe. Research is supposed to be based on objectivity. Education has prided itself on applying the scientific approach. Any recommendations for change must be supported by \"hard data\"\u2014by research studies scrupulously conducted using the scientific method. Messy subjective concepts such as beliefs and values don't lend themselves to measurement or statistical manipulation.<\/p> <p>In the past several decades, theorists have finally begun to recognize the importance of what goes on in the mind of an individual teacher. Research studies have explored the effects of teacher beliefs, the metaphors a teacher uses to describe his or her work, and the values a teacher assigns to a particular practice or concept. The studies have found that these thought processes have a profound influence on educational choices. But the results of those studies have been largely limited to academia. It is time for practicing teachers to have access to these ideas. It is the minds of those teachers that must be explored. It is the actions of those teachers that make education what it is today.<\/p> <p>Although my conclusions are my own, I've attempted to include support from as many different disciplines as possible. The references are there for those who want or need them. However, many teachers are less interested in theory than in how they can improve their teaching experience and the experience of their students. The main thrust, therefore, is immediate applicability. It's about what you can do today to be the teacher who matters to students.<\/p> <p>You may be astounded at how differently teachers think\u2014even about the meanings of the words teach, learn, or understand. I invite you to let your own experiences verify the validity of these ideas, rather than some distant study or some theorist's perceptions. Take the ideas you can use and leave the rest for others who may hold different perceptions and have different experiences.<\/p> <p>Despite the wishes of theorists, visionaries, and \"experts,\" there are no simple answers to problems as complex as those educators presently face. If you agree with the adage, \"If what you're doing doesn't work, do something else,\" you will find many ideas to enlarge your repertoire of \"something else.\"<\/p> <p>I sense that many teachers have reached the same level of frustration as people living under Communism when the Berlin Wall fell. In that case, a handful of people who'd had enough rebelled, creating the first breach in the Communist wall\u2014both literally and figuratively. When a relatively small percentage of people create stress in a social system, the entire system shifts to relieve that stress. I invite you to imagine as I do what our schools might be like if they became places where students and teachers alike shared the joyous and innate love of learning with which infants comes into the world.<\/p> <p>A handful of reflective teachers have it within their power to literally \"change the face of education.\" Let us begin.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Judy Yero Bio<\/p> <p>Education -<\/p> <p>\u2022BA from Dominican University: major in Chemistry\/Physics; minor in Philosophy \u2022MA in Curriculum Development from DePaul University \u2022Doctoral coursework completed at the University of Illinois; dual focus on neurophysiology and education\u2014taught teacher education classes as part of the doctoral program<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Master\u2019s\/Trainer level certification in Neurolinguistics<\/p> <p>Teaching experience -<\/p> <p>\u2022Taught 7th-8th grade physical science (3 years) \u2022Taught chemistry, physics, and physical science at a 3,000 student suburban Chicago high school (20 years)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Science department chair\u20146 years Professional Organizations<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Served on textbook evaluation, curriculum, and other national committees for the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Association for Science and Curriculum Development (ASCD) \u2022Served on the joint NSTA-NASA committee that chose the first student-designed projects to be performed in space<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022Teacher workshops: \"Learning From the Inside Out.\"<\/p> <p>More about Judy on her website: <a href=\"http:\/\/teachinginmind.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/teachinginmind.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Jamaal Bowman Bio<\/p> <p>Jamaal Bowman is a husband, father of three, and Founding Principal of Cornerstone Academy for Social Action (C.A.S.A.)

But the web development community is still largely ignorant about HTTP\/2 and what it means for their applications.<\/p> <p>This talk will outline the results of a new study by Ragnar Lonn, founder of Load Impact, where we attempt to measure the performance impact different types of applications would typically face if they switch their data transport from HTTP\/1.1 to HTTP\/2.<\/p> <p>As an extra treat, Ragnar will also release the software created as part of the study \u2014 a free online tool for developers to find out what happens performance-wise if their site or application is delivered over HTTP\/2 instead of HTTP\/1.1.<\/p> <p><b>--------------------------------------------------<\/b><\/p> <p><b>BIO<\/b><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/xebialabs\"&gt;<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grabnerandi\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>Load Impact CTO Robin Gustafsson is a system architecture expert who\u2019s been working with the company since it was founded in 2009.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business practice that involves company initiatives that give back - for example, donating a portion of proceeds to charity, minimizing carbon emissions and waste, organizing employee volunteer opportunities, or initiating cause-marketing programs - each designed to use business as a force for good.<\/p> <p>With more companies integrating CSR practices, this panel discussion will explore the challenges and opportunities of using business to positively impact society and the environment. How do businesses meet these imperatives while maintaining their economic competitiveness? How can they measure, track, and report on the impact that CSR initiatives have on both their community and their bottom-line?

But Doug Cutting, the Hadoop creator, predicted that, in the future, organizations will run all sorts of workloads on their Hadoop clusters, even online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads. Although Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix provide high throughput, low latency, random access on big data, developers struggle with the lack of ACID transactions. Trafodion is a world class Transactional SQL RDBMS running on HBase\/Hadoop, currently in Apache incubation. In this talk we will discuss the characteristic of operational workloads, the operational use cases Trafodion addresses, and why Trafodion is the right solution for these use cases. In particular, we go in depth of what is the recipe for a world class database engine, and how Trafodion implements the ingredients that make up that recipe such as world class query optimizer, parallel data flow execution engine, distributed transaction management system, performance, scale, availability, and future directions, etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>Speaker:<br\/>Rohit Jain is the CTO at Esgyn for Trafodion, a transactional SQL-on-HBase RDBMS.

The ships range from schooners to freighters and most of them sit on the lake bottom in the cold, fresh water just frozen in time. The names of the ships can still been seen on some of the wooden hulls, rigging on the masts that are still standing 70ft tall, and dozens of artifacts to be seen on each wreck. The lakes offer something for everyone from snorkeling to technical diving and each wreck has a story to tell.\u00a0<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<\/p> <p>Becky Schott is a multiple Emmy Award-winning underwater cameraman, photographer, and accomplished technical diver whose work can be seen on major networks including National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and the Travel Channel. She is co-owner of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.liquidproductionsllc.com\/\">Liquid Productions,\u00a0<\/a>Inc, specializing in capturing quality imagery in challenging environments. Her projects have taken her all over the globe from exploring virgin wrecks in over 300 feet of water in the Great Lakes, rappelling into caves in the jungle, filming under ice in the Arctic to diving cage-less with great white sharks.<\/p> <p>Becky is extremely passionate about sharing the underwater world with others both through her imagery or teaching someone to\u00a0dive. She's been teaching scuba since 2000 and is an active technical diving instructor and TDI Rebreather Instructor. In her spare time she\u2019s participated in several exploration projects around the world that have earned her a place as a Fellow in the Explorers Club and in 2013 she was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.liquidproductions.com\/\">www.LiquidProductions.com<\/a>\u00a0 \/\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.megdiver.com\/\">www.MegDiver.com<\/a><\/p> <p>****\u00a0 Note:\u00a0 The official\u00a0 Club Annual\u00a0 Meeting\u00a0 as per our bylaws, where\u00a0 club\u00a0 where elections will take place,\u00a0 will be held in\u00a0 November\u00a0 *****<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Second Floor - use backstairs","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/seagypsies\/events\/225542573\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"name":"Reminder -Oct.

She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.<\/p> <p>Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets G\u00e4etan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.<\/p> <p>With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

How do businesses meet these imperatives while maintaining their economic competitiveness? How can they measure, track, and report on the impact that CSR initiatives have on both their community and their bottom-line?

Deemed too small by the usual athletic standards, his father trains him hard, and Freddie brings a fight to the game that ultimately gets him noticed \u2014 by none other than legendary University of Texas coach Darrell Royal (Aaron Eckhart).

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive. They will learn how to use Light Room, Photoshop, Silver Efex Pro as well as Macphun Tonality to convert their color images to B&amp;W images.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This part of the workshop will run for 1-1\/2 to 2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>In the old days there was only monochrome photography. Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels. This is no different than tri-color separation filters that have Wratten designations of\u00a0 Wratten 29 - RED, Wratten 47 - BLUE and Wratten 61 - GREEN. We will use Photoshop and various plug-ins to create monochrome panchromatic renditions for your color images.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Once you have your images converted you will have the opportunity to have the image professionally printed at the workshop.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/1\/600_442774817.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/b\/600_442774827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Here are several images that were planned as a B&amp;W image well before the moment of capture.

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive. They will learn how to use Light Room, Photoshop, Silver Efex Pro as well as Macphun Tonality to convert their color images to B&amp;W images. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This part of the workshop will run for 1-1\/2 to 2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>In the old days there was only monochrome photography. Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels.

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive. They will learn how to use Light Room, Photoshop, Silver Efex Pro as well as Macphun Tonality to convert their color images to B&amp;W images.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This part of the workshop will run for 1-1\/2 to 2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>In the old days there was only monochrome photography. Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels. This is no different than tri-color separation filters that have Wratten designations of\u00a0 Wratten 29 - RED, Wratten 47 - BLUE and Wratten 61 - GREEN. We will use Photoshop and various plug-ins to create monochrome panchromatic renditions for your color images.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Once you have your images converted you will have the opportunity to have the image professionally printed at the workshop.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/1\/600_442774817.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/b\/600_442774827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Here are several images that were planned as a B&amp;W image well before the moment of capture.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>What will we be doing at the Meetup? <\/b><br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p><b>How long will the meetup be? <\/b><br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p><b>What will it be like? <\/b><br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p><b>Do members need to bring anything? <\/b><br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome? <\/b><br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.
