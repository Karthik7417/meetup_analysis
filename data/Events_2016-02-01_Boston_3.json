Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

I'll describe the Visual SLAM system that runs on the robot and conclude with a live demo.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0(2)\u00a0Sudeep Pillai, MIT CSAIL:\u00a0Towards SLAM-Aware Scene Understanding<\/p> <p>Robots need to be able to navigate through environments, perform manipulation tasks, and avoid obstacles, all while having a strong spatial and semantic understanding of its immediate environment. My research focuses on leveraging SLAM-aware robots to better inform scene semantics including object recognition. I'll discuss a recent result in SLAM-supported object recognition that improves monocular object recognition performance over existing frame-based techniques. Inherent to the spatial and semantic understanding is the choice of map representation. I'll discuss new map representations in the context of visual SLAM, and shall show some very recent results of an application involving high-speed map reconstructions using stereo cameras. Finally, I'll motivate the necessity for\u00a0self-supervised SLAM-aware robots that are capable of learning the representation of an environment while persistently experiencing and navigating through.<\/p> <p><br\/>7:20 - 7:30: 1 min pitches from audience.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

By sparking these untapped collaborations and this cross-pollination of ideas, we can tackle our most complex challenges more efficiently and more effectively.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Creating diverse panels that are open to the public will serve as a catalyst for reaching equally diverse audiences. Canopy's outreach efforts extend into the public schools, churches, technology companies, non-profits, startups, coffee shops, college campuses, community centers and are further enhanced by taking our message to the streets in grassroots fashion.<\/p> <p>What also makes Canopy gatherings different is our event format. Our keynote speakers illuminate the framework for the following moderated panel discussion. What is truly unique is the addition of a \"Canopy Featured Non-Profit\" at every event. At the end of the moderated panel discussion, we introduce our featured non-profit, who is hitting the respective challenge head on. Attendees are then encouraged to visit that non-profit's information table to sign petitions and volunteer forms, receive informative pamplets and purchase items.<\/p> <p>The Canopy Social Impact Series event model strives to:<br\/>(1) Connect people and cross-pollinate ideas<br\/>(2) Educate attendees and panelists<br\/>(3) Provide opportunities to get involved by supporting a local non-profit and direct involvement.<\/p> <p>Cross-pollinate - Educate - Activate<br\/>All funds raised through the cost of admission and individual event donations are split 50\/50 with the Canopy Featured Non-Profit. This is intended to empower their work and to keep the event series sustainable.<\/p> <p>We encourage you to make a contribution of any size to help us continue this mission.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SUPAProductTalksBoston\/events\/228242196\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":12600000,"name":"The Role of Innovation in International Peace & Security with Noam Chomsky","id":"228242196","time":1454020200000,"updated":1454033662000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369289386000,"name":"SUPA Product Talks Boston","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":8606892,"urlname":"SUPAProductTalksBoston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Product People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02026","country":"us","city":"Dedham","address_1":"680 Legacy Place","name":"Dedham Legacy Place","lon":-71.17804,"id":14347332,"state":"MA","lat":42.2323,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.4299573898,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453301668000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u201cRisen\u201d is the epic Biblical story of the Resurrection, as told through the eyes of a non-believer.

He committed suicide in 2013 after being indicted by the government for illegally downloading millions of academic articles from a nonprofit online database. From the age of fifteen, when Swartz, a computer prodigy, worked with Lawrence Lessig to launch Creative Commons, to his years as a fighter for copyright reform and open information, to his work leading the protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), to his posthumous status as a cultural icon, Swartz\u2019s life was inextricably connected to the free culture movement. Now Justin Peters examines Swartz\u2019s life in the context of 200 years of struggle over the control of information.<\/p> <p><br\/>In vivid, accessible prose, <i>The Idealist\u00a0<\/i> situates Swartz in the context of other \"data moralists\" past and present, from lexicographer Noah Webster to ebook pioneer Michael Hart to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

He committed suicide in 2013 after being indicted by the government for illegally downloading millions of academic articles from a nonprofit online database. From the age of fifteen, when Swartz, a computer prodigy, worked with Lawrence Lessig to launch Creative Commons, to his years as a fighter for copyright reform and open information, to his work leading the protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), to his posthumous status as a cultural icon, Swartz\u2019s life was inextricably connected to the free culture movement. Now Justin Peters examines Swartz\u2019s life in the context of 200 years of struggle over the control of information.<\/p> <p>In vivid, accessible prose, The Idealist situates Swartz in the context of other \"data moralists\" past and present, from lexicographer Noah Webster to ebook pioneer Michael Hart to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.<\/p> <p>In the process, the book explores the history of copyright statutes and the public domain; examines archivists\u2019 ongoing quest to build the \u201clibrary of the future\u201d; and charts the rise of open access, copyleft, and other ideologies that have come to challenge protectionist IP policies. Peters also breaks down the government\u2019s case against Swartz and explains how we reached the point where federally funded academic research came to be considered private property, and downloading that material in bulk came to be considered a federal crime.<\/p> <p>The Idealist is an important investigation of the fate of the digital commons in an increasingly corporatized Internet, and an essential look at the impact of the free culture movement on our daily lives and on generations to come.<\/p> <p>Event Co-Sponsor(s)<br\/>The Baffler: <a href=\"http:\/\/thebaffler.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/thebaffler.com\/<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1NjxXQT\">Purchase the Book online<\/a> or in person: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

The voice in my head which has always said 'you can\u2019t' has now been greeted with a stronger voice nipping that negativity and self-double in the bud with 'show me your credentials'.\" Barbara from my last group call \"Self-care and personal power\" (available as replay through my site).<\/p> <p>\"Thank you for the group clearing call just before Thanksgiving (three weeks ago at the point of note). I was in a very bad place emotionally at that time and since then I have felt calm, whole and happy. Many, many thanks for sharing your gifts with the world ... and with me!\" Love, Angela<\/p> <p>Registrants will have an opportunity to share their concerns with me in advance via email and will remain anonymous to one another on the call. Registration is paid through my site. Kindly \"book your seat\" at least a few days in advance of the Group Distance Healing Session Call.<\/p> <p>I will tailor the healing, clearing, balancing work to those on the call, within the framework of the group session ... In this case Heart-Love-Upper Torso. Those who will later be listening on-demand will also be included.

If you insist on parking in the area, be aware that meter maids love handing out parking tickets around here.\u00a0Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway or bus #1 to the Hynes stop.<\/p> <p>I have made an arrangements with the Itadaki staff for a simpler ordering method. Last time was very chaotic and stressful for the bartender, so lets do our best to not confuse the bartender. :)<\/p> <p><b>Ordering at Itadaki<\/b><\/p> <p>1) Order your first drink at the bar or when the bartender comes around. If it's alcoholic, your ID will be checked at this time. The bartender will take your name with your order and associate your future requests with you name.<\/p> <p>2) The bartender will try to make several rounds throughout the night to take additional orders. The bartender will associate your requests with you name.\u00a0Please feel free to order more food and drinks.<\/p> <p>3) Keep in mind we're a pretty large group so don't be offended or annoyed with the bartender if he doesn't get to you right away. If you have an urgent order, go request it at the bar.<\/p> <p>4) Please take care of your tab and don't forget to tip. The management and staff are doing a lot to make this all possible.<\/p> <p>See you there!<br\/>~Lindsay<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Go to the downstairs bar and look for the sign!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-japanese\/events\/227341395\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"Backbay Japanese Evening Table","id":"wcrgglyvcblc","time":1454025600000,"updated":1454038127000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1042101769000,"name":"Boston Japanese & English Language Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":86694,"urlname":"boston-japanese","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Japanese\/English Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02359","country":"us","city":"Pembroke","phone":"339-499-8506","address_1":"201 Oak Street","name":"Ian Murray Photography","lon":-70.764137,"id":3408522,"state":"MA","lat":42.102459,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":23.7441978455,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450716007000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Following the great success of our well attended and enjoyable critique night we are offering it again!<\/p> <p>bring along up to three images on a thumb drive or CD\/DVD and have them anonymously\u00a0and constructively \u00a0critiqued by Ian and the group.<\/p> <p>Having your images critiqued is a great way to improve your photography.\u00a0 Knowing how others see your wonderful images can be very informative and challenging.

DO NOT BRING IMITATION SPIKES OR ANY FORM OF YAK TRAX. In\u00a0 the event we run into low light or darkness, be sure to bring head lamps with spare batteries, lithium batteries being the best suited for lower temperatures.<\/p> <p><br\/>Use this link for a list of items needed for a winter day hike: \u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/492954\/Winter_Day_Hike_List_ADK.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/492954\/Winter_Day_Hike_List_ADK.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/492954\/Winter_Day_Hike_List_ADK.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Do not\u00a0rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail.\u00a0You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions...<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet\u00a0 at the trailhead for the Pine Bend Brook Trail, which is located on the south side of the Kancamagus Highway about 20 miles east of exit 32 off Rt. 93 in Lincoln, NH.\u00a0 We will start and finish our hike from here.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

On February 18, 1952, a massive nor\u2019easter struck New England, pummeling towns along the Eastern seaboard and wreaking havoc on the ships caught in its deadly path, including the SS Pendleton, a T-2 oil tanker bound for Boston, which was literally ripped in half, trapping more than 30 sailors inside its rapidly-sinking stern. As the senior officer on board, first assistant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) soon realizes it is up to him to take charge of the frightened crew and inspire the men to set aside their differences and work together to ride out one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast. Meanwhile, as word of the disaster reaches the U.S. Coast Guard station in Chatham, Massachusetts, Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) orders a daring operation to rescue the stranded men. Despite overwhelming odds, four men, led by Coast Guard Captain Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), set out in a wooden lifeboat with an ill-equipped engine and little, if any, means of navigation, facing frigid temperatures, 60-foot high waves and hurricane-force winds.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-movie-group\/events\/226945043\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"name":"The Finest Hours (7:15 IMAX 3D)","id":"226945043","time":1454109300000,"updated":1454181779000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1140735210000,"name":"Boston Movie Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":225256,"urlname":"boston-movie-group","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Movie Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"550 Arsenal St,","name":"Old Country Buffet","lon":-71.158279,"id":24324718,"state":"MA","lat":42.363892,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.52422523499,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453688973000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi, language learners.<\/p> <p>Let's eat Buffet and do language exchange.<\/p> <p>It is 15 dollars( without tips), all you can eat, please bring 17 dollars cash with you if you decide to come.<\/p> <p>Let's chat and make new friends in Boston.<\/p> <p>See you all there on Friday.<\/p> <p>Wengang<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/9\/7\/600_446218263.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Call me 8574729251.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Language-exchange-club\/events\/228337643\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"Language and culture exchange in old country buffet","id":"228337643","time":1454110200000,"updated":1454121098000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443564371000,"name":"Boston Language Exchange Club","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":18980681,"urlname":"Boston-Language-exchange-club","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"language learners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01906","country":"us","city":"Saugus","phone":"781-941-2220","address_1":"647 Broadway","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-71.022072,"id":535709,"state":"MA","lat":42.479221,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.60999393463,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453332186000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We've got the room at Panera to play Cranium.

Given a little money to initiate his long-dreamt-of film museum, Henri Langlois procured Epstein\u2019s silent masterwork straightaway\u2014\u201cnot only the ultimate expression of ten years of experimentation,\u201d Langlois observed, \u201cbut their justification.\u201d For Epstein, however, it was only one in a long line of turning points. After channeling Poe, he repaired to Brittany\u2019s remote islands to make a series of films that now seem positively prophetic in their fusion of ethnographic principles and avant-garde aesthetics. \u201cIt was and still is very important to set the camera free in the extreme,\u201d Epstein wrote in 1930, and, indeed, he approached each new work as if the medium itself hung in the balance.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u00a0\u00bd x 11\u00a0(Six et demi, onze)<\/b><\/p> <p>Directed by Jean Epstein.

The title refers to the standard format of a Kodak camera, and indeed cameras play a pivotal role in the narrative\u2019s many reversals. Two brothers fall in love with the same woman, consecutive cases ofamour fou\u00a0anticipating the\u00a0nouvelle vague\u2019s penchant for reflexive love triangles by some thirty years. \u201cThere was a time not long ago when hardly a single American drama was without a scene in which a revolver was slowly pulled out of a half-open drawer,\u201d Epstein reflected in 1926. \u201cI loved that revolver. It seemed the symbol of a thousand possibilities\u201d\u2014and the genesis of\u00a06 \u00bd x 11.<\/p> <p><b>His Head\u00a0(Sa t\u00eate)<\/b> Directed by Jean Epstein.

However, BeatSeeker is capable of much more than just syncing your sessions tempo to a drummers groove, it can read any rhythmic audio input and adjust your Live sessions tempo accordingly. During the workshop we will explore BeatSeeker and its functionality, as well as some basic synthesis in the context of a modular synthesizer environment.

Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls. What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Please bring a blanket, a pillow and a yoga mat to enhance the comfort of your experience!

The big question concerning questions about\u2018God\u2019 is not whether s\/he\/it exists but about what the word means. If we do not agree on what \u2018God\u2019 means then how are we going to form an opinion about whether or not God exists. And, if the question is not so much a question about existence than it is about meaning then the distinctions between atheism, theism and deism become very muddled. Atheism, therefore, seems to me to be just as muddled as the various forms of belief in God. What is it that the atheist does not believe in? The atheist has just as much need for clarity on the meaning of \u2018God\u2019as do religionists if only because you cannot disbelieve in something that you cannot define, because if you cannot define your term you cannot put it into a statement which you think you want to refute. Hence, the statement, \u201cGod does not exist\u201d is meaningless unless you are prepared to define the thing that you want to reject.<\/p> <p>Buddhism provides an interesting focal point. I remember, a number of years ago, listening to a radio interview with Michio Kaku, the well-known physicist and writer of popular books on the subject. I don\u2019t recall the exact context, but a question about God or spirituality came up and he said that he was raised in a Buddhist home and that Buddhists are 'atheists\u2019. That comment struck me because I really do not think of Buddhism as being an atheist religion which,anyway, is probably an oxymoron. I have since come to understand that Buddhism is considered non-theistic (Kaku's comment aside) because while it rejects deities it is distinguishable from atheism. I am not a student of the atheist movement, but my impression is that most people who today call themselves 'atheist' refer to a very scientific, naturalistic and radical empiricist view of reality that rejects any sense of immateriality and not merely theism, while also embracing a humanism that deeply supports the notion that we don\u2019t need to believe in God to be moral or good.<\/p> <p><br\/>In conclusion, my view is that the God issue is a big muddle that, while having speculative value, has little else. For my part, I do not consider myself to be an atheist, however, I do not think one needs to believe in God to be good. My personal speculations flow more in a non-atheistic Buddhistic direction (but I do not consider myself to be a Buddhist either) of believing that there is a transcendent Mind (of some sort) that is complementary with notions of spirituality. This perspective can be very unscientific! But I believe in science. I hope that I have at least provided some food for thought...<\/p> <p><br\/>********************************<\/p> <p>Gold and Bronze Memberships entitle you to attend a wide range of great events.

An all-powerful Player will prompt the audience to make key decisions along the trail, determining how obstacles such as rivers, disease and bandits will be faced by the wagon crew.

REVIEWS -<\/p> <p>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood!<br\/>Sara you are an angel among angels.<br\/>I am grateful. Thank you 3. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>4. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>5. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>6. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/227877233\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":7200000,"name":"Morning Meditative Sound Bath","id":"227877233","time":1454169600000,"updated":1454177810000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":10.1041755676,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453822719000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dear Waltham Polyglots,<\/p> <p>Let's get together again for some great conversation and to meet new people (or to see some familiar faces!).

We will answer questions and help you successfully house train your puppy. We will talk about dog training and demonstrate some things that trained dogs can do. The meet up can be loud and active with lots of barking, but it will be organized, so that you and your puppy can learn new things.<\/p> <p>This MeetUp is for all puppies ages 8 weeks- 20 weeks.

Jascha Heifetz made his NYC \u00a0debut at a sold-out Carnegie Hall in knee pants at the age of 12. John Stuart Mill was fluent in Greek at 5. Most Nobel Science prize winners have done their most meritorious work before age 30. Galileo was an esteemed celebrity from his earliest days...a true Renaissance Man!<\/p> <p><br\/>Charles Darwin trained to be a physician but didn't make the grade. He then got \"gentleman's C's\" at Cambridge and failed to proceed to his planned career in the clergy. His father, a successful physician, despaired his second son would ever amount to anything and told him so. Charles operated in the shadow of his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, \u00a0a well-reputed intellectual. Who could have predicted the eventual outcome of this ineffectual performance?\u00a0<\/p> <p>And then he sat on his revolutionary insights for 12 years and almost got scooped by a schoolteacher from New Zealand.\u00a0<br\/>What were the psychological and sociological and theological and medical issues which resulted in this bizarre procrastination of success in a man of genius? This man was sitting on top of a volcano that was about erupt into Victorian England. Perhaps he feared the controversy that would likely engulf him with the publication of his magnum opus. Actually, one of the major struts supporting his initial thesis was mistaken, but he had no way of knowing that the the time.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Joe Gerstein will review some of the issues percolating in Darwin's life and times that might have influenced his behavior. Then let's all speculate about the importance and pertinence of each as we approach Darwin Day, one of organized humanism's most important tributes to science and humanity.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPARKING:<\/p> <p>Discount Parking ONLY be available in the nearby Eliot St. Garage, only about a block away from the Hub.\u00a0Bring your Eliot street parking ticket and it will be validated for a discount of $2 off.<\/p> <p>Metered on-street parking is also available in Cambridge, and the Hub is just a short walk from Harvard Square T subway service.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GreaterBostonHumanists\/events\/227807450\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"GBH Darwin Day Celebration Talk: Was Darwin a Dunce?","id":"227807450","time":1454175000000,"updated":1454186848000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1260304523000,"name":"Greater Boston Humanists","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":1567113,"urlname":"GreaterBostonHumanists","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"27 Brattle Street","name":"Brattle Plaza, Harvard Square","lon":-71.120636,"id":17966342,"state":"MA","lat":42.373299,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.74912810326,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452599524000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a free outdoor event so please dress warmly for the weather.

If you can't make a week, don't worry, you can still come to the other weeks.<\/p> <p><br\/>The 10 weeks will include clinics on technique, flip turns, and any special requests, as well as some good sets to get us swimming faster.

She is a Shamanic Practicioner, Legally Certified Spiritual Healer, Reiki Certified And Professionally Certified Sound Healer. Sarah leads retreats, workshops, Sound Healing classes, group sessions and offers private healings. Her focus is to help people come into their power, overcome challenges, releasing past emotional traumas, stress and anxiety reduction as well as soothing physical pain. Sarah has had beautiful responses to working on issues surrounding infertility, hormonal imbalance, anxiety, grief, depression and emotional traumas. Sarah travels extensively to pursue her studies, share the magic of sound as a healing tool and to recharge and continue her spiritual nomadic path in service and dedication. REVIEWS -<\/p> <p>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood!<br\/>Sara you are an angel among angels.<br\/>I am grateful. Thank you 3. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>4. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>5. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>6. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/227790722\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":6300000,"name":"Sound Bath (Men and Women Welcome)","id":"227790722","time":1454182200000,"updated":1454190538000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":1.23497855663,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433259061000,"fee":{"amount":65,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>There is nothing more wonderful than a nice stroll through Boston on a summer day, that is, unless you add food and wine!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\nThis fabulous\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2 hour guided walking tour<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0stops at fine Boston restaurants and wine stores to teach you how to buy wines, find hidden gems and\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>educate you in the fine art of wine tasting and food pairing<\/b><\/p> <p>.

Featuring two full bars and a dance floor, OBERON's Diane Paulus-created wonderland was inspired by Studio 54 in its heyday, when celebrities and art icons would mix and mingle with kids from Queens, and the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack would be shaking the speakers. While you -- and the rest of the audience -- drink, dance to disco classics or just check out the action, the motley crew of characters in this glammed-up, sex-fueled version of Shakespeare's play re-enact the hilariously chaotic tale of a magic elixir that wreaks havoc at the nightclub.

There won't be any awkward \"I hope I'm chosen before the kid in the full body cast\". The \"rules\" will be explained by the referee before playing starts. They aren't complex, and there won't be any instant replays for controversial calls.<\/p> <p>It's designed to be fun, playful, and casual. The only rule I can remember is not aiming for someone's head. Ladies, I can't guarantee that the guys are going to follow that one : ) Guys, this is still not the best way to get a woman's attention\u2026.<\/p> <p>All levels are welcome! We will be playing on a padded floor, wearing socks (<b>remember to bring socks!<\/b>).\u00a0The arena is air conditioned and is smaller than a typical dodgeball court.\u00a0There are two individual bathrooms that some people change in.

If you find yourself unable to attend an event that you've RSVPed \"Yes\" to and you cannot either change your RSVP or let the venue know, please do contact the Event Organizer when you're able to, just to let us know that you're okay and that you're still interested in attending events.\u00a0 Please be advised that any Assistant Organizer (AO) or the Group Organizer (GO) can remove a member from Social Fun who has 3 No-Shows in the past 3 months.\u00a0 Additionally, Organizers may disallow members with 2 or more \"No Show\" marks from attending their events.\u00a0 *Please keep in mind that we are reserving pool tables based on the number of people who RSVP Yes to attend and if we show-up missing more than 10% of the people it has an adverse affect on everyone else attending as well as the venue as we are planning based on RSVPs and if there's a Waitlist (WL) then you are taking away a spot for someone else if you do not change your RSVP when you are no longer able to attend.*<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b>\u00a0Free parking on-site and in their extended lot across the street. \u00a0If lots are full drive north on Route 53 to the next set of lights where you will take a right (onto Scammell Street) and then you can take a left into the big free parking lot where Quincy Credit Union and a gym are located. \u00a0(Please do not park in the strip mall or Citizens Bank parking lots.)<\/p> <p><b>Directions\/Location Overview:<\/b>\u00a0 This is located on Route 53 NB in Quincy about 2 miles from the Braintree line and less than 1\/2 mile from Kam Man Plaza (where Bradlees used to be over 2 decades ago). \u00a0This is also on the bus line which you can catch from the Quincy Center T station. \u00a0<i>For exact directions, please go to their website or google map it.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Please Note:<\/i>If you are a member of Social Fun or any other group participating, please RSVP Yes w\/ one group and No w\/ the other group(s). \u00a0I can give you credit for attending for all groups but only if you RSVP in some way w\/ SF as it's very challenging to find people in that group to add them in when editing attendance.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the Front Desk and then at our Pool tables thereafter.

These are the acceptable brands and models:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Tubbs Flex ALP, Flex VRT, Flex TRK, or Mountaineers.<\/p> <p>\u2022 MSR Lightening, Revo, or Evo.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 TSL Symbioz Elite or Expert.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Atlas Aspect, Endeavor, or Series 10\/11\/12.<\/p> <p>You will also need traction - while you can bring mountaineering crampons if you want I think all you will need is either Kahtoola Microspikes or Hillsound Trail Crampons.

Meet at noted touring center at 10 am for 5-6 hours of moderate paced, led machine cut track kick and glide skiing. Novice to advanced skiers welcome, we will ski a few hours, return to the lodge for lunch, then ski a few hours in the afternoon. Group will likely break into a faster and more moderate paced group; extremely fast (and skaters) or slower skiers are welcome to self-guide. These are show and go trips on machine groomed and patrolled nordic centers, no need to pre-register. Participants should self-pay for the center trail fee. We recommend beginners take a group lesson before attending one of these trips. All trips ski off at 10 am sharp, arrive in time to get your skis waxed and gear together; look for leaders at trail head near lodge. Trips may go in marginal conditions, but lack of snow and\/or rain will likely cancel the trip.

Meet at noted touring center at 10 am for 5-6 hours of moderate paced, led machine cut track kick and glide skiing. Novice to advanced skiers welcome, we will ski a few hours, return to the lodge for lunch, then ski a few hours in the afternoon. Group will likely break into a faster and more moderate paced group; extremely fast (and skaters) or slower skiers are welcome to self-guide. These are show and go trips on machine groomed and patrolled nordic centers, no need to pre-register. Participants should self-pay for the center trail fee. We recommend beginners take a group lesson before attending one of these trips. All trips ski off at 10 am sharp, arrive in time to get your skis waxed and gear together; look for leaders at trail head near lodge. Trips may go in marginal conditions, but lack of snow and\/or rain will likely cancel the trip.

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter at The Hawthorne Building, the large glass doors to the left of H&R Block.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group\/events\/227960625\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":4500000,"name":"The Salem MA Weekly Meditation Group","id":"dfdktkyvcbpc","time":1454277600000,"updated":1454351749000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1232459353000,"name":"The Salem MA Meditation Meetup Group","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":1362498,"urlname":"The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"50 Quincy St. (Swedenborg Chapel)","name":"Quincy St @ Kirkland St Bus Station","lon":-71.109734,"id":24274202,"state":"MA","lat":42.373615,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.24069142342,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451451823000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ESL Students Event!<\/p> <p>This is a free event.

The sensation is one never to be forgotten. On all sides are ghosts, not of the dead, but of living people. Here, during the day just passed, have come the people pouring in from the town and the country around. Farmers with their wives and children and all the people from the hundreds of little frame houses have gathered within these board walls. Young girls have laughed and men with beards have talked of the affairs of their lives. The place has been filled to overflowing with life. It has itched and squirmed with life and now it is night and the life has all gone away. The silence is almost terrifying. One conceals oneself standing silently beside the trunk of a tree and what there is of a reflective tendency in his nature is intensified. One shudders at the thought of the meaningless of life while at the same instant, and if the people of the town are his people, one loves life so intensely that tears come into the eyes.\u201d\u00a0--from Winesburg, Ohio<\/p> <p><i>Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life<\/i> is a 1919 short story cycle by Sherwood Anderson.
