She was a child prodigy at the Paris Conservatory who worked with four famous French composers: Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, and Maurice Ravel (we have information in the French School archives to validate this). She performed Saint-Sa\u00ebns' second concerto with Saint-Sa\u00ebns conducting the orchestra, at age 15 in 1907. It was Sergey Rachmaninov who advocated to the US State Department that she be allowed to emigrate to the US to bring solfege to this country.<\/p>\n<p>Through Claude Debussy, the lineage of musicality continues up through Franz Liszt, Carl Czerny, and Ludwig van Beethoven (you can Google this in the Wikipedia pages). So former students of Mlle. Combe and her students (including Stephen Waters and more) are musical descendents of these famous composers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was Mlle. Combe's piano student from 1972 - 1982 and performed at Carnegie Recital Hall nine times as a child, and many of my classmates did as well. Alumni who went professional musically have worked with Zubin Mehta and Constance Keene, gotten degrees at Juilliard and numerous conservatories, and become worldwide concertizing artists, professors at conservatories, resident composers and artists.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sounds intimidating, doesn't it? Here's the thing: were we a bunch of freaky Mozart genius kids? Oh heck no. What happened was that we were given wildly efficient and effective piano practice methods, solfege lessons to develop our understanding of music, and insights from a teacher who knew exactly what the French composers intended with their compositions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who are part of the French School of Music family were given an extraordinary opportunity, and we fully intend to pass along what we learned from Mlle. Combe. Our mission is to ensure that future generations of music students have the same opportunity that we had, including adding their names to an amazing musical lineage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all who are passionate about music, who want to learn better piano practice techniques, and learn how solfege can help you build a solid musical foundation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>- Eileen Chang Sauer<\/p>\n<p>French School of Music <br>210 W 8th Street <br>Plainfield, NJ&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>(908) 757-3087<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>info@frenchschoolofmusic.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.frenchschoolofmusic.com\">French School website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/French-School-of-Music-710622825625877\/\">French School Facebook page<\/a>, which includes historical artifacts and photos from French School, recordings of recitals, as well as video of Carnegie Recital Hall performances and trophy ceremonies in the 1970's.<\/p>\n<p>My dad's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianopractice.org\">piano practice book<\/a>, capturing Mlle.

It is a phrase that's meaning lives uniquely in the mind's eye of the individual who encounters it -- the feeling that it elicits inside of them. The fact that Spirit Animal Karaoke came tumbling out of my mind and off my lips was, I believe, only just to give me the opportunity to share this enigmatic cluster of syllables with the world. And I choose to do so by setting it free. So, whether or not you join this group, know that Spirit Animal Karaoke is just as much yours as it is mine as it is everyone's.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The Meetup Group:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Before I had any inkling to create this group, I had already put the vaguest of plans in motion to create a real life -- ostensibly one-time, definitively free -- event, called Spirit Animal Karaoke, on March 21, 2016. Which is to say that I began moving forward without any concept of this event's contents or how it was to come together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This Meetup<span>&nbsp;group is a part of the natural evolution of this process, which is improvisational. And I welcome you here, and invite you to contribute in any way you are comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>The Nitty and the Gritty:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Though I am this group's organizer, I do not see my role here as setting the precedent of what this group <i>is<\/i>, or myself as the leader or owner or decider of anything. I don't know where things go from here, and I don't think I will until someone else points the way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To that point, I'd like to suggest that&nbsp;you -- yes,&nbsp;<i>you<\/i>&nbsp;! -- have come to be here, not by chance, but because something in <i>you<\/i> has pulled <i>you<\/i> forward. Something inside clicked when <i>you<\/i> read the words Spirit Animal Karaoke, and <i>you<\/i> allowed yourself to be swept up, even momentarily, in the mystery of that phrase. I ask you to trust that. Allow yourself to open to the very real power that resides in the kindling of your imagination's fires. You're not on the hook to do anything more than take the next step. And that's all that this or any process is: one foot in front of the other.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Community:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I have created two events in a similar fashion and I learned a great deal from those experiences. Trust is key; you have to trust that I am who I say I am and this is what I say it is. Unvoiced ambitions can be harmful. So please know that with regard to this event, and this group, I come to things with a preexisting agenda that's limited to name, date, and time. And my hope is to create with you, something we can share in equally.<\/p>\n<p><b>Me:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If it's of interest to you, I invite you to visit my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adamguthman.org\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":198281249,"name":"Adam Guthman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/highres_253047555.jpeg","photo_id":253047555,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/member_253047555.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/thumb_253047555.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"Spirit Animal Karaoke","id":19363902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Spirit-Animal-Karaoke","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453177887000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"northern-new-jersey","name":"Northern New Jersey","id":35537},{"urlkey":"jersey-city","name":"Jersey City","id":57300},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"jersey-city-singles","name":"Jersey City Singles","id":86353}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-County-Single-Professionals-Meetup\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>This is the Meetup you single professionals West of the Hudson River have been waiting for!

Our main focus is for <strong>adventurous singles<\/strong> to meet and connect with fellow singles and like-minded adventurers to have fun together and perhaps becoming friends in the process without the pressure of dating.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are looking for a dating site this is not it, please look elsewhere.<\/strong> Please respect your fellow members. Any inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and person with the inappropriate behavior will be kicked out of the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT OUR HIKES<\/strong>: We subscribe to the premise that hiking should be a fun, leisurely experience. It\u2019s NOT about how fast you can hike. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to chase after. Hiking is about taking the time to savor the sights and sounds of nature. It\u2019s about enjoying each other\u2019s company, get to know each other, while on the trails and perhaps even hug some trees along the trails. We will keep at a leisurely pace on our hikes, with plenty of stops for catching our breaths, having refreshments, and taking in all the Kodak moments. Everyone will go at their own pace, with no fear of being left behind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE, NO SPEED DEMONS<\/strong>. If you want to go fast, there are plenty of other hiking groups on Meetup that can accommodate your need for speed. All our hikes will be on weekends within the NY\/NJ area, many of which hikes will be serviced by public transportation. Occasionally we\u2019ll do hikes where we\u2019d have to carpool to get there.<\/p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT OUR CLIMBING EVENTS: <\/strong>Rock climbing provides a full-body workout that tests the mind as much as it does the body -- and also happens to be a lot of FUN and ADDICTIVE. There are more opportunities to do it than ever before, too, with several indoor facilities that cater to the vertical workout popping up throughout the city over the past five years. We will do climbs at Brooklyn Boulders in Queens and Brooklyn, as well as at The Cliffs in LIC. No worries if you are new to rock climbing. It's very easy to learn as long as you are open to adventures. We will practice and learn together on our way to becoming ROCK STARS.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to indoor climbing, we will on occasions do outdoor rock climbing as well as ice climbing up in the Shawangunk or the Catskills regions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER ADVENTURES WE WILL PARTAKE IN<\/strong>: Ziplining, skiing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, travelling to places near and far, wine tasting, skydiving \u2026&nbsp;the<strong> possibilities are ENDLESS<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong> WHO SHOULD JOIN THIS GROUP<\/strong>: Singles of all ages who like to hike at leisurely pace, rock climbers of all skill levels and\/or just anyone with a sense of adventure and a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and try new things. Please leave the drama and crankiness at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong> MEETUP FEE:<\/strong> It is FREE to join a Meetup group. However, each group\u2019s Organizer does pay a fee to Meetup HQ to keep the site up and running. Meetup Organizers have the option to charge a minimal fee to help defray the monthly Meetup cost. Therefore, a $1.00 Meetup fee will be collected at randomly selected events. Our organizers DO NOT make any profit from running this group.<\/p>\n<p><strong> IMPORTANT GROUP RULES<\/strong>: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group. It is about the quality of members in the group! We would rather have a small group of \"quality members\" than a huge group of \"joiners\" and \u201clurkers\u201d who never show up to any event.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With that said:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(1) To join the group, you must have a recognizable face picture; <\/p>\n<p> (2)&nbsp;If you are a general lurker who join the group but not participate in any event, please don\u2019t bother to join.<\/p>\n<p><strong>General rsvp policy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes rsvps ONLY if you are serious about attending an event.

But for those of us lucky enough to live here, Queens is a world unto itself. <\/p>\n<p>Yes, Queens can seem baffling to outsiders. It\u2019s New York\u2019s largest borough by area, a sprawling, gritty streetscape where 30th Avenue intersects 30th Road and 30th Drive, street addresses involve numbers like 135-25. This might explain why visitors and residents from across the river generally stayed away, at least until recently\u2014while a certain other borough next door grabbed all the attention. But while the brownstones of Brooklyn may have a corner on charm, Queens traffics in a different sort of energy. Its allure is authenticity, and its beauty is on the plate. &nbsp;An entirely delicious one. How could it not be? <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/c\/0\/600_446108128.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>The borough has one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the country. Name an immigrant group and you\u2019ll find them settledin Queens: Greeks and Egyptians in Astoria; Thais in Woodside and Elmhurst; Mexicans in Corona; Nepalese, Indians, Bangladeshis, and South Americans in Jackson Heights; Chinese, Taiwanese, and Koreans in Flushing. It\u2019s a patchwork, polyglot landscape that, not coincidentally, offers up some of the city\u2019s finest momo, bao, tacos, moussaka, pad kee mao, dosas, kebabs, kasha, soup dumplings, and almost any other far-flung specialty you can think of\u2014often just an elevated train ride away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The concept of this group is simple: <\/strong>to develop a social forum for&nbsp;Queens friends and neighbors to convene for fun and frolic&nbsp;who can enjoy meaningful experiences, fun social interaction and good times together \u2026 all within our backyard!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the plethora of activities we will partake in: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> DINING OUT:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong> One of the most wonderful things about Queens is its melting pot of ethnicities and its incredible ethnic diversity identity. &nbsp;Those in the know all know Queens has off-the-hook affordable ethnic eats that are the welcome result of living in the city\u2019s epicenter for cultural diversity. &nbsp;Exploring different ethnic restaurants in Queens and sampling their delicious ethnic foods is a must, whether you live in Queens, in NYC or are just visiting. Eating in an ethnic restaurant is about more than just the food, it\u2019s a cultural experience that gives you a literal taste of life in another land. <\/p>\n<p><strong>If you enjoy dining on good food, meet new people in a fun and relaxed environment<\/strong>, then come join us and together we will eat our way through a cornucopia of exotic cuisines representing all corners of the globe \u2026 all in Queens!<\/p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE at our dining events, we will dine FAMILY-STYLE<\/strong>, which means we order a variety of dishes and share them, together with sharing the final bill, together with tax and tips. &nbsp;Drinks are separate and are the sole responsibility of the drinkers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A PICKY EATER, OR HAVE STRICT DIETARY RESTRICTIONS, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS GROUP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER FUN ACTIVITIES<\/strong>&nbsp;we will partake in: &nbsp;Indoor Rock Climbing, Bowling, Archery, Movie Nights, Visiting Museums \u2026 the possibilities are endless ... all located in our backyards.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>MEETUP FEE<\/strong>:&nbsp; It is FREE to join a Meetup group. &nbsp;However, each group\u2019s Organizer does pay a fee to Meetup HQ to keep the site up and running. &nbsp;Meetup Organizers have the option to charge a minimal fee to help defray the monthly Meetup cost. &nbsp;Therefore, a $1.00 Meetup fee will be collected at randomly selected events.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT GROUP RULES<\/strong>: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group. It is about the quality of members in the group! We would rather have a small group of \"quality members\" than a huge group of \"joiners\" and \u201clurkers\u201d who never show up to any event. <\/p>\n<p><strong> To join the group<\/strong>, you must have a recognizable face picture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are a general lurker<\/strong> who join the group but not participate in any event, please don\u2019t bother to join.<\/p>\n<p><strong>General rsvp policy:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Yes rsvps ONLY if you are serious about attending an event.

Welcome the word\u2019s first drinking club dedicated to bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats. Ideally, this Meetup aims to foster meaningful political discussions\u2014and hopefully camaraderie\u2014between people with opposing viewpoints. At the very least, it hopes to bring together people who share an interest in American politics. In order for this Meetup to be successful, we must keep these goals in mind:<\/p>\n<p>1. In order to generate interesting discussions, we need a mix of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Preaching to the choir is not as fun\u2014or as constructive\u2014as debating issues. Consequently, since New York City is majority-Democrat, reaching out to non-liberals is a priority.<\/p>\n<p>2. We need good topics to discuss at every Meetup. Topics can be specific or general. Possible topics include: privately-funded healthcare vs. publically-funded healthcare, interventionism vs. isolationism, conservatism vs. mainstream republicanism, Bernie vs. Hillary, Trump vs. the establishment, pragmatism vs. idealism, deportation vs. path to citizenship, flat tax vs. graduated tax, security vs. privacy, mental health reform vs. gun control, voter fraud vs. voter suppression, gerrymandering, student loans, the death penalty, women in combat, the pay gap, drug policy, welfare, the minimum wage, labor unions, education policy, terrorism, Israel, Iran, Syria\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3. We need to be able to respectfully discuss our differences. We\u2019ll see whether alcohol helps or hinders achievement of this goal.<\/p>\n<p>4. We need to not ONLY talk about politics. We also want to get to know each other and make new friends. Alcohol will definitely prove helpful in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>5. We need to welcome people of various knowledge levels. Those with a lot of knowledge need to be both teachers and debaters.<\/p>\n<p><span>More to come!

That's it. No speed dating, speaker series, Bible study, joint socials with non-Catholic groups, or anything else. There are other Catholic groups that have those things covered. But unlike those groups, this group will not be tied to any particular parishes. We will get to experience Mass in as many Catholic churches as we can, as many different neighborhoods as we can, even as the number of Catholic churches in New York dwindles. Many of these churches have amazing stories to tell down through the generations.<\/p>\n<p>This is neither a liberal nor conservative Catholic group so please keep politics out of it. I'm most interested in meeting my fellow Catholic single young and not-so-young-anymore (20s, 30s, 40s) adults, but all ages are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the words of Pope Francis in mind: \"...big cities are a reminder of the hidden riches present in our world: in the diversity of its cultures, traditions and historical experiences.

With this method we can \u201cdiagnose\u201d and make visible the patterns and blockages which have followed us from the past. The most healing approach to those traumas is not to run away and to forget, but to bring them out. Like the vampire that disintegrates into dust when brought out to the sun \u2013 the traumatic story, when brought out to the conscious level, stops programming our behavior and becomes a valuable experience and knowledge. This practice will give you a chance to work on your personal problems and to serve as a helper in other people\u2019s constellations. The experience of participating in somebody else's constellation gives you deep knowledge of the family relationship structure. This practice brings valuable wisdom to the participant, opens their heart and vision. The Family Constellation method effectively addresses: \u2022 relationship problems \u2022 career issues \u2022 business and financial difficulties \u2022 bodily pain and illness \u2022 depression \u2022 habitual emotional and behavioral patterns When we experience depression, emotional instability, problems with our relationship or career, a common practice is to search for an answer within the realm of our own views and personal history. However, in some cases these issues arise not from personal history, but from our ancestral memories - from the traumas which happened several generations before us. We perceive such traumas as an atmosphere of pressure, danger or threat which affects our feelings and actions. A person with a traumatized \u201cfamily field\u201d intuitively feels that his\/her family energy is too \u201cheavy\u201d and rejects it, putting a barrier between them and their family energy. In a case like this the negative energies are partially blocked, but the power of the family and ancestors\u2019 blessings are blocked as well. In order to move forward you need to feel safety at your back. It is not easy to understand and heal wounds which came from the past. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what happened generations ago. If we do know some stories we feel they are not too important \u2013 we see them as grandmother\u2019s tales of the far past. Those traumas manifest as a tense and heavy atmosphere in our relationships with parents, spouses or kids. They can also manifest as repeated patterns of events in our life.

The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". \n\nTop reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:\n\n1. It is Free of Charge. \n\nBecause It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.\n\n2. It is simple and easy.\n\nDo not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday. \n\n3. Anyone can do it.\n\nJust need pure desire in your heart and it starts flowing. \n\n4. Scientifically proven and accepted worldwide.\n\nRefer to the links that we provided below for scientific articles. It is accepted in many countries around the world. \n\n5. Become integrated in your life.\n\nThis meditation will help bring your physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual being into balance. \n\nFollowing is the link you can go to and get more info on sahaja meditation and its locations:\n\nwww.sahajameditation.com\n\nThis meditation is scientifically proven and has helped many people with various diseases and disorders.

Let's get together in casual setting and begin to explore the world of finance. Our goal will be to get together once a month after work to demystify money and investing and drink wine together!","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":198788662,"name":"Amy Mooney","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/d\/6\/highres_253356054.jpeg","photo_id":253356054,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/d\/6\/member_253356054.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/d\/6\/thumb_253356054.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"NYC Upper West Side Professional Women Investing Meetup","id":19455338,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Upper-West-Side-Professional-Women-Investing-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Financially Literate Women"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454026618000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"millennials","name":"Millennials","id":15124},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"personal-branding","name":"Personal Branding","id":18452},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LifeWellMade\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Life Well Made community is for millennials entrepreneurs and conscious leaders to awaken their dreams and thrive instantly.

There are no background checks of any kind.<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;2. \"So, what will we talk about?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Anything, and everything. Whatever that comes up naturally in the moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3. \"Do I have to prepare ahead of time?\"&nbsp; <\/b> <br>-When meeting a friend, do you plan the topics to be discussed ahead of time?&nbsp; <br>I would assume the answer is No! And m\u00fcrmur is no different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>4. \"Is it like an interview?\"&nbsp; <\/b> <br>-Nope! It's not an interview. It's a conversation.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. \"Can I say anything I want?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Absolutely. You can even curse like a sailor if you want to.<\/p>\n<p><b>6. \"I don't know if I'm interesting enough.\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Not true. Everyone has lived through a few amazing life experiences. As long as you're truthful and sincere, that's interesting enough for me.<\/p>\n<p><b>7. \"I want to promote my (band, product, business), can I talk about it on your show?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Yes, and no. If you're coming on m\u00fcrmur with the purpose of promoting, then you're missing the whole point!&nbsp; <br>For instance, I realize that if you're a musician, it's very likely that we will stumble upon the topic of music at some point during our talk. It's inevitable! But let's not make it the focal point of the entire chat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And besides, the podcast is simply not large enough at this point to earn you many new fans.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>8. \"OK. So, it's kind of like an in the moment conversation between two strangers.\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Yes!<\/p>\n<p><b>9. \"Cool, I think I'd like to come. May I bring a friend along?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-While I do have an open door policy, unless special assistance or care is necessary, I prefer that the conversations are kept one on one.<\/p>\n<p><b>10.\"When will the talk be aired?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-About 2 to 5 weeks. Feel free to check the Facebook, Twitter, or iTunes page for updates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>11. \"Oh also, how do I know when we start recording?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Usually at some point after sitting down, I'll go and hit record. You'll be able to see the sound waves going up and down on the computer screen.

Your work day is 12 hours with commuting. You sleep maybe 6 hours a night. The rest of the time is taking care of the kids, spouse, dog, cat, partner, laundry, shopping, cleaning and a few other errands that you've been putting off for weeks. How do you fit one hour of exercise a day into that schedule? You don't. That's why a few pounds accumulate each year right after the holidays that you can't seem to get off before summer. This group is about 15 minute workouts that get results (indoors and out). Nutrition tips that you can actually do. Work smarter and more efficiently without spinning your wheels.

This work is based on the simple physics of vulnerability: If we are brave enough, often enough, we will fall. What does that mean? We all have a story about an experience; a situation, a conversation that made us feel bad, sad, hurt, and ashamed. It can be a story of personal heartbreak, a story from our childhood, a relationship and\/or a professional struggle. It's the story where we think we are not good enough; smart enough, thin enough, or even not worthy of being loved. That we\u2019re a bad friend, parent, spouse, boss, son, or daughter. When we don't resolve these feelings, they stop us from having courage in our day-to-day lives. Who should take this workshop? This work is for anyone that wants to: - Explore a story of struggle - Get curious about the emotions that keep us stuck in our story - Learn how owning our story of struggle gives us the power to write a brave new ending How does Rising Strong work? The work is broken down into three acts and is facilitated through discussion, video and written exercises. Act I: The Reckoning \u2013 We Walk Into Our Story. Act II: The Rumble \u2013 Owning Our Story. Act III: The Revolution \u2013 Process Becomes Practice. We write a new ending to our story based on our key learnings and use this new, braver story to change how we engage with the world and to ultimately transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":106571132,"name":"Susan G.

It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.&nbsp; <br> <br>Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity&nbsp; <br> <br><b>What is Sahaja Meditation?&nbsp;<\/b> <br> <br>How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.&nbsp; <br> <br>How does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.&nbsp; <br> <br>Once awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Overview.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.&nbsp; <br> <br>If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.&nbsp; <br> <br>Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.&nbsp; <br> <br>There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>The power of collective meditation<\/b>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12407024,"name":"Nirmal K Mukhi"},"members":7,"name":"Meditation Classes, Kingsbridge NYPL, Bronx - Always Free","id":19471790,"state":"NY","urlname":"Meditation-Kingsbridge-Library-Bronx-Always-Free","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454218552000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"black-entrepreneurs","name":"Black Entrepreneurs","id":16348},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"job-search","name":"Job Search","id":21900},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"minority-entrepreneurs","name":"Minority Entrepreneurs","id":79827},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"minority-small-business-owners","name":"Minority small business owners","id":134717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Minority-Women-Owned-Biz-M-WBE-Diversity-Tech-Careers\/","rating":0,"description":"Thank you for your interest in this new community of minority, women, &amp; (and other diversity group members) either currently (or seeking to) own and become a \u201d government certified (M\/WBE) business enterprises, and\/ or simply desiring to explore other methodologies of business capitalization, growth, and utilizing tech and new media to develop new business and career opportunities.
