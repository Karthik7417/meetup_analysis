Right now, it's training season at Little Skips in Bushwick, where you can skip and learn all about it April 10, 17, 24, and 26 at 2PM. For New Yorkers in the know, Skipping Club is a great source of fitness, a dose of joy in our week, a visceral way to get outside our comfort zones, an excuse to dress up, and a way to journey back to our youth. It's also a unique way to see the city and a faaaaaahbulous social outing. Every Thursday at 2 - and select happy hours, nights and weekends, Skipping Club skips a one-mile route, with intervals, exploring a new neighborhood around the city. From the Upper West Side and Central Park to Williamsburg, dive into a new theme - sartorially and spiritually. Enjoy curated music, improv-style games, meditations, urban adventures and a delicious hand-picked food and drink spot. Come skip, rediscover your playful innocence, paint the streets with joy, emit waves of positivity into the universe, and find your rhythm!

We hold our events in different places in central NJ, so don't pay too much attention to the listed group location!<\/p>\n<p>We focus on a form of energy healing known as Reiki. What is it? It is better understood when broken apart. Rei is universal Wisdom and Ki is life force energy. When put together, Reiki means Universal Life Force Energy that is Divinely Guided. What Divine means is completely up to you: Reiki carries no dogma and requires no specific way of thinking, so it is compatible with any religion or set of beliefs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When people practice Reiki, they put aside their ego and thoughts to act as a simple channel for the energy, the same way a wire allows electricity to pass through. Anyone and everyone can benefit from Reiki, as the energy helps regulate blocked or deficient Ki. Your Ki is affected by your state of mind and your day-to-day life, and energetic disturbances eventually cause illness and dis-ease. \u00a0Reiki practitioners help restore your body, mind, and spirit to the natural state of pure perfection.<\/p>\n<p>Reiki is a way to purify the holistic self, reduce stress and anxiety, and ultimately further one on his or her spiritual journey. Each person takes something different away from a session, because Reiki is always for your best and highest good. If you've never received it before, we encourage you to come to a share so that you can have a taste and see what it's all about.<\/p>\n<p>Come join other beautiful souls as we share, explore and unfold the magic of Reiki!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74.4300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/highres_353782452.jpeg","photo_id":353782452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/600_353782452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_353782452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":123272232,"name":"Lindsay Barber"},"members":139,"name":"Reiki Love New Jersey","id":13963922,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Reiki-Love-NJ","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Beautiful Souls"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397753633000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nursing","name":"Nursing","id":385},{"urlkey":"registered-nurse","name":"REGISTERED NURSE","id":18933},{"urlkey":"licensed-vocational-nurse","name":"LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE","id":18934},{"urlkey":"licensed-practical-nurse","name":"LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE","id":18935},{"urlkey":"nursing-student","name":"Nursing Student","id":37195},{"urlkey":"nurses","name":"Nurses","id":55568},{"urlkey":"nurse-practitioners","name":"Nurse Practitioners","id":134860},{"urlkey":"nurses-network","name":"nurses network","id":151025},{"urlkey":"networking-for-nurses","name":"Networking for Nurses","id":154006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dedicated-Nurses-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for nurses past, present and future who appreciate the devotion, hard work, caring, and especial rewarding nature of the career that is nursing.

By nature, for the past few years anyway, I've turned into a real worrier and pessimist, due to a few downturns in my life, so I thought I could use this class. Well, there was another bump in the road in my family life (my daughter lost her job) but instead of my typical hand-wringing, poor us, reaction, I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement for her...automatically, without trying. I feel I've been re-wired by Mark's weekly guidance and my subsequent daily practice. Would I say it's a miracle? \u00a0I think so...... The point is, it works. \u00a0Come join us and see for yourself. \u00a0Thank you, Mark.

Primordial voice is given to every single human. It is and intelligence on its own, the most amazing inbuilt guidance system, it is a healer within. PV is active in children up to the age of 3 years and can be activated during sexual experience, a serious illness or a form of mourning which is actually a healing vibration.<br>\n\nThrough Primordial Voice Technique you can reach untapped phenomenal abilities everyone possesses. These abilities are often hidden deep inside and accessed through the power of one\u2019s own Primordial Voice, a very powerful teaching allowing to re-recognize one\u2019s own strength.<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice teaches you to reach forgotten self confidence and live in agreement with your own true self. A grown-up person has 2 voices: a \u201cthinking\u201d voice which is active, and primordial one which is usually dormant. A \u201cthinking\u201d voice is a voice connected to the intellect that communicates the data registered by the brain. The vocal cords and muscles are used to produce a thinking brain. Primordial Voice is connected to the \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cheart\u201d , it is produced by trachea and smooth muscles that are connected to our subconscious mind. It communicates our inner wisdom, our inner guidance; it says, \u201cI lead you, I guide you\u201d.<br>\n\nKnowing your Primordial Voice and recognizing it is the most powerful tool to the secret of life, making the right choices, committing to the right situations, and interacting with the right people. Remember, you have spent many years trying to change yourself just to fit the general standards, to acquire qualities that are not yours and do not reflect your unique nature. The question is whether or not you have succeeded? And does your success set you free?<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice is not about changing or improving: it is about KNOWING yourself and living in accordance with your TRUE SELF. Knowing who you are is the key to your freedom. The PV program is a course consisting of several stages of special exercises, breath work and energy work, and although it takes time to master this technique, even one hour of this work will give you the experience of what it is like to be your own master.

It is reassuring beyond words to know this truth - which we demonstrate through Mediumship (communications with spirit). Our mission is to share the light, love and knowledge of spirit without divisive dogma or restrictive rules. We create an open and loving atmosphere within the Church; one which welcomes people from all faiths and denominations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A MEDIUM AND\/OR MEDIUMSHIP?<\/b><br>\n\n A medium is a person who is sensitive to the thought and energy vibrations which come to us from those in Spirit. A medium can attune to the Spirit people, and is able to describe them and relate their thoughts, emotions, memories, and messages. Mediumship is a natural gift of the Spirit and has many purposes: it brings comfort to the bereaved; it offers spiritual nourishment for the soul; it becomes a vehicle for God\u2019s Healing Spirit; and it demonstrates the potential of the individual to break through self-imposed limitation and, thus, become part of a Greater Whole.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL HEALING<\/b>?<br>\n\n An important part of of the Spiritualist experience is healing. Healers are simply channels for healing; the source of all healing is God. Our trained and designated healers direct healing light and energy according to each individual's needs. At every Sunday service during a period of meditation, we offer the opportunity to sit in one of our healing chairs for hands-on energy healing (given by a touch on your shoulders).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>IS SPIRITUALISM A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION?<\/b><br>\n\n Spiritualism is the vehicle through which all religions have been given birth. We embrace the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth. We consider Jesus a great prophet, medium and healer. His connection with the Divine was so strong that one could consider him as God's Presence on Earth. Was he the only such manifestation of God's Love and Grace? No. During times of spiritual crisis, God sends messengers of the Word to help guide us; Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna and Mohammed, to name a few. One can be Christian and a Spiritualist; one can be Jewish and a Spiritualist; one can be Buddhist and a Spiritualist; etc.<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n SUNDAY SERVICE:<\/b><br>\n\n The highlight of our Church week is Sunday worship. Our worship service integrates music, prayer, healing, meditation, inspiration and Spirit communication into the beautiful and unique experience of Spiritualist worship.

Sounds good so far. Almost two thousand years earlier another also very sharp Greek dude named Aristotle wrote that not only is happiness the greatest good, it\u2019s the only end in life, everything else being just a means. Okay, that makes sense too.<\/p>\n<p>This group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions:<\/p>\n<p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>2. Spend more time socializing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>4.

Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Here's some background on the research our group is based on:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change<br>\n\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a> By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.75,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/highres_358264572.jpeg","photo_id":358264572,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/600_358264572.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/thumb_358264572.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3373400,"name":"George"},"members":614,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","id":14180342,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1398869619000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"stop-renting-and-buy-your-own-home","name":"Stop Renting and Buy Your Own Home","id":34016},{"urlkey":"first-time-home-buyers-workshop","name":"First Time Home Buyer's Workshop","id":34018},{"urlkey":"home-buying-process-step-by-step","name":"Home Buying Process Step by Step","id":42522},{"urlkey":"how-do-i-begin-my-home-search","name":"How Do I Begin My Home Search","id":66477},{"urlkey":"smart-home-buyer","name":"Smart Home Buyer","id":70601},{"urlkey":"first-time-homebuyers","name":"First time homebuyers","id":736072}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-NY-House-Buyers-to-meet-in-Manhattan-Sat-5-31\/","rating":0,"description":"Expanding family?

I formed this walk group for people who are new to the area (or old) or even considering moving into an area and would like to explore the different cool parts of the towns and cities along the Hudson. I always feel that people move into a specific area only after having probably zipped through the neighborhood sitting in a car. Well yes, one does get a \"vague\" idea of the place but do you really get to enjoy it? Then do you come back again and again to take in the flavour? Maybe, maybe not. So as a way to give back to the society I decided to form this meetup. Usually the walks will not be over bearing or long. However for your &amp; everyone else's enjoyment, you have to be physically fit to be walking and being on foot for at least an hour or more. To keep it interesting we can end the walk in an interesting place to eat or drink from time to time. Every meetup we'll be exploring different areas for Jersey City, Hoboken and West NewYork. If you want more cities to be added feel free to get in touch with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/6\/0\/600_358735392.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p>*Members should understand and agree that they will be obligated to pay the bill for the food or drinks they have incase the meetup ends at a place of food or drinks.<\/p>\n<p>*As a member of this group you are not allowed to solicit other members for your products, business or services.

Whether you are a longtime meditator or new to the practice, you are welcome to join us. Instruction will be given. Together, we can practice staying grounded in the present moment by stopping, focusing on our breathing, and observing our thoughts and feelings without getting lost in them. By sitting and walking in this way, we can gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By continually practicing with the support of community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened and our concentration deepens.

This Meetup was created in the hopes of having one central listing for all NYC history related events in the city. &nbsp; In a way this is more of calendar than it is a Meetup, but if people enjoy this resource then I would be down to create more social types of event. &nbsp;And if you do plan to go to an event feel free to RSVP and invite people for pre- or post- event hanging out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also if you enjoy this resource and want to help out please feel free to contact me. &nbsp;I want to add events from as many sources as possible, but it might be a bit much for one man.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also a few disclaimers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp; One, I do own a sightseeing company for full disclosure, but I will mention which if any events are from my company. &nbsp;I don't think I'll list many at all or for a while.<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Two, I will provide links to all the venues with the event posting. &nbsp;If you want to confirm that you will be able to join an event check there to see if it's been canceled or is sold out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Three, event hosts in this Meetup means that they manage the posting, not that they will actually be attending the event (unless they say otherwise.) &nbsp;If you are attending the event and want to let people know RSVP. &nbsp;If you would like to do something before or after the event let people know in the comments.<span>&nbsp; With that having been said here's the criteria for the events I list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 1) &nbsp;Must be New York City related in some way. &nbsp;Related being the key word. &nbsp;If there's a talk on the Dutch colonial period, but not specifically on New York I might throw it in the mix.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 2) &nbsp;Must be history related in some significant way. &nbsp;Doesn't have to be all history based to qualify. &nbsp;A tour of the High Line that talks about the future plans of the site in addition to it's history is fine. &nbsp;An event that only talks about present or future events will not be added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the purposes of this Meetup I will say it will have to deal with events at least 20 years old to be \"historical\".<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 3) &nbsp;Daily or weekly events will not (for the time being) be added to this Meetup to prevent clutter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Enjoy and please feel free to give me feedback.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; SOME PLACES WE CHECK FOR EVENTS:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; BROOKLYN BRAINERY \/ BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY \/ BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY \/ MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK \/ NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF PARKS &amp;

Yet, its medical\/martial origin was gradually stripped from it by subsequent generations of practitioners, rendering a form that is definitely better than not doing any type of physical activity, yet not able to deliver all its unmeasurable potential.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a difference must be made between this worldwide known style, and the original style that was passed down by Lu-Ch'an's other grandson, Yang Shou-hou, and preserved by the World Taiji Boxing Association, that will enable the serious practitioner to take advantage of all the benefits offered by the work of geniuses.

I would say that we probably needed a 50% upgrade to Excel, but what we got is more like a 500% upgrade; and that is not a number I throw around lightly. Imagine the year is 1910, and you are one of the world's first biplane pilots. One day at the airfield, someone magically appears and gives you a brand-new 2012 jet plane. You climb inside and discover that the cockpit has been designed to mimic the cockpit of your 1910 biplane! You receive a DRAMATIC upgrade to your aircraft without having to learn how to fly from scratch. That is the kind of 'gift' that PowerPivot provides to Excel Pros.\" The purpose of this Meetup is to explore this new \"toolset\" and push our Excel data-crunching prowess to the maximum. I would like to begin with the founding members, going chapter by chapter, as a group, through Rob Collie's book, \"DAX Formulas for PowerPivot, A Simple Guide to the Excel Revolution\". I imagine, that if the group grows, those founding members will then be well-versed enough to provide instruction and guidance to new groups members. This is a very exciting new technology, applied to the most ubiquitous business tool in the WORLD!!!

You can only learn it from other women who have gone before you and are dedicated to showing you the way. Feminine business entrepreneurs work on the principal of exchange. Women want to be in business for ourselves but not to be in business by ourselves. Successful women don't come from working smarter or harder, they come from belonging to a global network of women, all dedicated to conducting business from the heart. As women we understand the true meaning of service and that gives us a great advantage in an economy where fortunes will be made by people serving other people. If you have the heart to help other woman and are open to the love and support that business women around the world can bring and if you have exhausted all of the traditional possibilities for earning success, please join us to open your heart and open your eyes and see the new business reality unfolding all around you. Expect to receive the respect you deserve for all the incredible service you've done for the people you love; to feel appreciated by other women who have also made great sacrifices and to meet women like you who began practicing our unique approach and they will become your mentors, coaches, your role models and, most importantly, your friends.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":131040522,"name":"Polina Stolyar"},"members":49,"name":"GWEN-Global Women Entrepreneur Network-New York!","id":14912422,"state":"NY","urlname":"GLOBAL-WOMEN-ENTREPRENEUR-NETWORK-GWEN-of-NEW-YOUR-CITY","category":{"name":"women","id":35,"shortname":"women"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Global Women Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Paramus","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402059215000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"homebrew","name":"Homebrewing","id":233},{"urlkey":"beer","name":"Beer","id":1475},{"urlkey":"home-brewing","name":"Home Brewing","id":24660},{"urlkey":"beer-making","name":"Beer Making","id":25454},{"urlkey":"craft-beer","name":"Craft Beer","id":28718},{"urlkey":"micro-brewed-beer","name":"Micro Brewed Beer","id":34913},{"urlkey":"beer-tasting","name":"Beer Tasting","id":44153},{"urlkey":"beer-lovers","name":"Beer Lovers","id":46593},{"urlkey":"home-brewers","name":"Home Brewers","id":70998},{"urlkey":"brewing","name":"Brewing","id":1166862}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bergen-County-Brew-Crew\/","rating":5,"description":"A Home Brewers club for people in Bergen County.

Hip hop rivals pop and country music as the most lucrative music forms in world. Spanish language radio and TV ratings out-perform its English language counterparts in many of the largest media markets. The NFL, MLB and NBA each have various ethnic and racial groups highly represented on the field or on the court.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the staffs and front offices of these venues, teams and promoters don't always reflect the diversity on the field, on the stage or in the stands. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidesport.org\/RGRC\/2013\/2013_NBA_RGRC.pdf\">The Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Sport reports<\/a> that the NBA's player population stands at 81 percent men of color yet only 7 percent of team CEOs are Black, Latino or Asian American. In music, three of the top-grossing concert artists are Jay Z, Beyonce and Bruno Mars but what percentage of the arena's sales and marketing staff are people of color? When working at a venue or with a promoter, how do you connect with industry colleagues and other resources to help you market and sell more tickets to diversity markets?<\/p>\n<p>Our group seeks to to do three, fun things to help:<\/p>\n<p>1. Network! We have a network of sports and entertainment sales, marketing, PR and venue operations professionals that would love to get together and network and make new connections. We also know lots of people would like to explore getting a job with a sports team or a art house venue but don't have the knowledge or the connections. We could be a fun group to learn more and make those connections.<\/p>\n<p>2. Attend Live Events &amp; Meet Insiders. We also look to schedule outings where we can to see a great show or sporting event but get something a little extra - like see a show then have an artist meet-and-greet or attend a sporting event and then meet current team employees to learn about the industry. There are lots of great opportunities for these kinds of outings throughout the NY\/NJ region.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u00a03. Have Fun!

This is a mastermind group for people interested in the art and business of fiction writing. Our motto - \"when one boat rises, all boats rise.\"\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Below is some basic information. Please visit the various other sections of our site for more details.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Our Goals<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Ours is not your typical meetup group. Our primary focus is to help writers at all levels of development, to evolve and improve both their skills as a writer, and their knowledge\u00a0 and abilities in aspects of self-publishing. We do this by pursuing four goals.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 1 - To Sharpen our writing skills through discussions of craft and technique, by performing fun group writing exercises, and by critiquing each others work in a structured format.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 2 - To add to our knowledge of the\u00a0 craft and business of writing, through the selected readings of some of the best books on the market. Each month our group will read one book from a list of selected titles. What we learn from each book, will be the basis of our discussions as we share ideas and experiences, building on the material we've read.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 3 - To explore the rapidly grow opportunities arising from the world of self-publishing through discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas. Building mailing lists, construction of marketing funnels, building product catalogs, calls to action, e-book pricing, hybrid publishing, paper print vs digital - all these subjects and more will be examined.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 4 - To network with like minded writers, to share ideas, to encourage, to mastermind. Writing can be a lonely pursuit. It often helps to get together with those walking the same path as you. As the group grows and gets comfortable with each other, additional gatherings may be arranged, from an occasional get together over a few drinks or a cup of coffee, to going as a group to a writers conference (RWA 2015!).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Who This Group Is For<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>This group is primarily for story tellers, writers of fiction and\u00a0memoirs. While all writers within these categories are welcome, it should be noted that this group will be especially geared towards the entrepreneur, the person(s) looking to write professionally, or at least make some supplemental income. Self-publishing will also have a strong focus, though we will also touch on traditional and hybrid publishing during the course of our journey. Existing professional writers are more than welcome (we will worship you accordingly), as are beginners and everyone in-between who have finally decided its time to pursue that dream.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The group is length agnostic - short stories, novella's, novels, serials, all are welcome. The group is also genre agnostic. Whether your writing westerns, science fiction or romance, the crafting of story shares the same techniques and difficulties.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Which is Why ...<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Writing groups are notoriously tough to start and maintain on meetup.com. With your help, we're going to be different. While we appreciate you joining our little \"kickass\" group, \"just joining\" and three dollars will help pay for coffee. SHOWING UP to a meeting is what really counts! Come to a meeting. You will have fun, sharpen your skills and learn tons of valuable stuff.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><i>Lesson two - start with a call to action, then end with a call to action.

We'll go to the movies, museums, farmers markets, dine out in local restaurants, try different cuisines , go out bicycling kayaking, plan picnics, happy hours and hey hey !

Socionics is similar to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, only a lot more advanced to better explain personality type and inter-type relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Socionics is a personality typology developed in the 1970s and '80s by the Lithuanian researcher Dr. Au\u0161ra Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. Socionics is based on Jung's personality type theory, Freud's theory of the conscious and unconscious, and Antoni Kepinski's theory of information metabolism. Since its inception, it has been developed by a variety of Russian researchers like Gulenko. The name \"socionics\" is derived from the word \"society\", because Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 believed that each personality type has a distinct purpose in society, which can be described and explained by Socionics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships.

Cyclist or Paddler or neither. Come learn and try in tiny successful fun bits. Most of all we want you to experience the full door to door round trip motor experience. We came from 11 years of USA Cycle road racing 20 years of NYC Club Rising and now 3 years of SUP paddling on all local water ways. We provide certified instruction in both activities.

We organize social skates and get-togethers in the city, trips around the eastern seaboard and farther afield, clinics, seminars, parties and promote skate advocacy. We provide discounts at skating stores, discounted subscriptions to skating magazines, and occasionally give our members free merchandise from our sponsors. For a full list of membership benefits, visit the membership page on our website.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Evening\/Night Skates are a great way to meet people. Our Tuesday Night Skate, New York's longest running night skate, is for more experienced skaters who want to experience all the thrills of skating in and around the five boroughs at night. We also always join the Wednesday Night Skate leaving every Wednesday at 8 pm from Union Square South. This skate is for intermediate skaters who are comfortable skating in traffic (And it's a blast!!!).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day Skates are longer trips, usually half to a full day long, to Coney Island, CT Beaches, Westchester Trails or along the Jersey Palisades (for example), and are for intermediate level skaters. Possible day-long skates might involve hopping aboard a commuter train and heading off to a skating place in nearby Westchester, Long Island or southwestern Connecticut. Our leaders are experienced skaters who have done these routes many times. Benefit from their experience and discover places you otherwise might never have thought about reaching on skates. It's fun and easy!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Skating Trips to other cities are weekend long trips providing the opportunity to skate, party &amp; socialize with hundreds of our skater friends from all around the country (and beyond) in Philadelphia, Boston, Washington DC, Miami and elsewhere. Our own version of this is The Big Apple Roll (BAR), usually the first weekend of August each year.

Connected Warriors is a community based volunteer organization providing free, trauma-conscious yoga therapy for service members, veterans and their families in the United States. Connected Warriors was founded in August 2011 by a group of professionals and yoga teachers in the South Florida area who, as long time practitioners themselves, know the powerfully beneficial effects of this ancient system. Connected Warriors has established a nationwide network that includes 568 Certified Yoga Teachers who volunteer their time and talents to instruct classes at local yoga studios, community veteran centers and other donated spaces. As of July 2013, we conduct approximately 175 classes each month with an attendance of about 1,000 participants. Therapeutic yoga practices, including relaxation and meditation, are a valuable treatment component for post traumatic stress and other trauma-related psycho-emotional difficulties. Overseas deployments can affect service members, veterans and their families for years.

We advocate for preventive medicine, especially good nutrition, conduct clinical research, and advocate for higher ethical standards in research. Our membership includes 150,000 health care professionals and concerned citizens.\n\nWe encourage higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research:\nWe oppose unethical human experiments. While great strides have been made in eliminating such experiments, problems remain. For example, children are still given synthetic growth hormone in experiments to make them taller, and both children and adults are exposed to unnecessary new drugs which have toxic effects.\n\nWe promote alternatives to animal research and animal testing. We have worked to put a stop to gruesome experiments, such as the military\u2019s cat-shooting studies, DEA narcotics experiments, and monkey self-mutilation projects. \n\nWe also promote nonanimal methods in medical education. Currently, more than three-quarters of all U.S. medical schools have dropped their animal labs for medical students.\n\nThe Physicians Committee has led the way for reforms of federal nutrition policies.  Our clinical research programs are breaking new ground in diabetes, cancer, and other serious conditions.  PCRM\u2019s Cancer Project has provided vital information to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe New Four Food Groups is the Physicians Committee's innovative proposal for a federal nutrition policy that puts a new priority on health.\n\nOur public service announcement series features medical experts on prevention and health.\n\nThe Physicians Committee is a nonprofit 501c3 organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":158713292,"name":"Kate Krone"},"members":7,"name":"PCRM Benefit & Auction with Dr. Neal Barnard in Amagansett","id":16031062,"state":"NY","urlname":"PCRM-Benefit-Auction-with-Dr-Neal-Barnard-in-Amagansett","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"PCRM Supporters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Yonkers","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406578072000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrapbook","name":"Scrapbooking","id":211},{"urlkey":"jewelry","name":"Jewelry Making","id":746},{"urlkey":"cardmaking","name":"Card Making","id":6669},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"rubber-stamping","name":"Rubber Stamping","id":17350},{"urlkey":"scrapbooking-classes-workshops","name":"Scrapbooking Classes & Workshops","id":52231}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crafty-in-Yonkers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A group where locals can meet, mingle and craft.

Laurie Bizzarro, P.C.\u201d representing Plaintiffs in personal injury, construction accidents and Employment Discrimination cases.<\/p>\n<p>GARY SUTO<\/p>\n<p>Gary Suto grew up with Hungarian\/Gypsy Grandparents and was surrounded with Astrology, Palmistry, Cardomancy and Numerology. He would not consider himself a Hereditary Witch, but very close to it. He has been practicing divination for 35 years, and his skills include Tarot, Iching, Numerology, Runes and Palmistry. He is a \u00a0High Priest of Temenos Ophiuchus, a grove of the Minoan Brotherhood; High Priest in NY Coven of Witches, a coven of the Wica Tradition, initiated by Lady Rhea; Founder of NY Gay Men's Open Pagan Circle; Co-creator of NY LGBT Open Pagan Circle; Co-founder of Prometheus Rising, Queer Men's Pagan Festival; Past Instructor at the Pagan Center of NY, Psychic Reader and life coach at Magickal Realms and Catland Bookstore; \u00a0He has given workshops and led rituals at various festivals and NYC locations. Hecate came to him at one of these festivals approximately 13 years ago and has been one of his main Deities ever since. On a mundane level he is a fashion designer and graphic designer. He is putting those skills to use in creating Pagan Clothing and Jewelry as well as a Tarot deck that will incorporate the Iching.<\/p>\n<p>JSTERLING HURLEY<\/p>\n<p>From his early childhood JSterling had a connection to the plants and animals who inhabited the woods surrounding his parent\u2019s farm in central Ohio. He was raised in an agnostic home with no formal spiritual guidance which allowed him to explore his own spiritual path as a young adult.<\/p>\n<p>As an out gay youth he worked against homophobia and charted his way through hostile environments and helped other gay youth through violence, ignorance and hate.<\/p>\n<p>JSterling is a High Priest of the Minoan Fellowship Tradition and is priest of the Minoan Brotherhood. He is a green witch and has used his knowledge of plants, aromatherapy and herbology both in his magickal and mundane life. He strives to provide a venue for the LGBT pagan community to become empowered and to reclaim their place as healers, shamans and guides of the dead.\u00a0 Throughout all his training both formal and informal the constant has been the connection to his patron Goddess, Hekate. For within himself She shines through. From the wisdom of the darkness She shine light. And from the potential locked within us all she provides the key of fullness.<\/p>\n<p>MARIO PABON ANDRACA<\/p>\n<p>\u200e<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mario.a.pabon?hc_location=timeline\">Mario Pab\u00f3n Andraca<\/a> has been a practicing pagan for over fifteen years. After being a solitary practitioner for a few years, Mario joined a Wiccan coven of the Gardnerian tradition called Polyhymnia Coven in New York City. He is now a Third Degree High Priest in this Coven.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, after his first encounter with Hekate, Mario joined Arn Draiocht Fein (ADF), and successfully completed their Dedicants' program. Currently he is pursuing ADF's Clergy Training. Currently he holds the position of Scribe in the New York City Grove \"Inis Ull\".<\/p>\n<p>Mario has also recently joined both the Sorita D'Este's Covenant of Hekate, and Hellenion, a Greek Reconstructionis religious organization. Mario discovered Hekate in the Between the Worlds festival where she came to him and guided him to where he is today. His path is mostly Hellenic in private practice, while still teaching Wicca and leading a coven. Most recently he has been given the responsibility to lead and officiate the central Hekate rituals in the very same festival where she first came to him.<\/p>\n<p>MATTHEW SAWICKI<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Sawicki is a Traditional Witch and lifelong devotee of Hecate. He hails from the mountains of North Eastern Pennsylvania and learned much of his craft and magick from his upbringing there. Matthew has been initiated into three separate traditions of the craft, most notably The New York Wica Tradition where he is a 3rd Degree High Priest, The Minoan Brotherhood and the non-wiccan tradition of The Clan of Tubal Cain out of the UK, which remains his main focus and current tradition. Matthew has been a Priest of Hecate whose public rites have led people to her for over 10 years. Matthew is known for his \"Rites of Crossroads\" rituals at the Between the Worlds Men's Gathering in Ohio that has brought more than 80 men together in her worship. Matthew lives in New York City and looks forward to continuing his work as a priest of Hecate to those who seek her.<\/p>\n<p>ANNA LEWIS<\/p>\n<p>Anna Lewis, a NYC native Witch and Pagan is thrilled to be a part of the magick bringing The Temple of Hecate to light. She is a longtime friend of Lady Rhea, Magickal Realms and the NY Coven of Witches as well as Horn and Cauldron of Rhode Island. She currently lives in Rhode Island where she turns the wheel of the year with her young family, worships Yemaya in the sea by day and Hecate at the crossroads by night. She is grateful to the goddess for her many blessings and for the opportunity to aid others in their devotion.<\/p>\n<p>Please join our meetup page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Temple-of-Hecate-Inc\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Temple-of-Hecate-Inc\/<\/a> and facebook page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/333721350124288\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/333721350124288\/<\/a> (The Temple of Hecate, Inc.) for events and further information on the temple and our Directors.

Join the thousands of Citizens Climate Lobby members who are actually moving Congress toward bold climate solutions that could change everything. <br> CCL will change the way you think about democracy. We're not about marches and protests-- we're about you talking directly to your Senators, Congressmen and their top advisers. If you want to make real change happen, this is an incredibly effective form of advocacy. You will be amazed at how much power you have as an informed and inspired citizen. <br> There are lots of ways you can inform and influence your members of Congress-- through letters, emails, phone calls, newspaper articles, and through live meetings with your Congressman, Senators and their advisers. We'll teach you how to do any or all of the above-- wherever your comfort zone takes you. And we'll inspire you to maximize your effectiveness as an advocate for real climate solutions. <br> Best of all, we have a plan and a solid climate proposal for Congress that's actually gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. It is non-partisan, politically viable, scientifically sound, and economically feasible. Economists say it is the most cost efficient approach. Scientists say it is our best shot at saving the planet. <br> We think New York area citizens deserve a special seat at the table when climate change is being discussed because when it comes to climate impacts and sea-level rise, they have a lot at stake. So we are focused on uniting New York area &nbsp;citizens this year. We already have established local CCL chapters in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens\/Nassau, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester, and Columbia counties in NY, as well as Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Red Hook, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, NY, in Fairfield County in Connecticut, and in Central New Jersey. <br> Join us for an introductory conference call or New York Area Local meeting near you! <br> Website info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com<\/a> <br> What does climate scientist Dr. James Hansen say about CCL?\"Most impressive is the work of the Citizens Climate Lobby, a relatively new, fast-growing, nonpartisan, nonprofit group with [193] chapters across the United States and Canada.

This group is open to anyone who is interested in improving their fitness, losing weight, getting stronger and becoming more flexible. My classes are primarily focused on quality, not quantity meaning I'm looking for proper form and technique while using full range of motion. Each exercise circuit is timed to ensure everyone goes at their own pace. I also use progression and regression methods based on fitness levels to ensure you are getting to most out your workout. I don't like to call my class boot camp because it sounds like a hard core, going all out until you puke class. Rather, I like to call it personal group training because its intimate in size and I can give the small groups of 10 or less individualized attention.

As entrepreneurs and professionals, it is imperative that we stay around like minded individuals. Relationships are the&nbsp;catalyst for success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. In this&nbsp;ever so growing competitive&nbsp;job market, you will quickly learn that it is not always what you know, but who do you know.<\/p>\n<p>3. You never know what personal connection or business deal is hidden in a little conversation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. If you are seasoned, you can meet a young pup with&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of pep to do heavy lifting for you.<\/p>\n<p>5. If you are new, you can meet an expert in your&nbsp;field and skip a lot of mistakes just by listening to their experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What makes us different?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>1.Here at the NJ Networking Circle we like to keep things fun and innovative, even for the shy and timid.

You can consider it to be either the cool down of a long week or the warm up to a great weekend; the choice is yours.

Hopefully, the readings will spark discussion about themes, concepts, ideas and issues relevant the Asia diaspora; Asian American; Pacific Islander and immigrant experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our target audience is those of Asian descent in NY (Manhattan, Queens, LI, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens). Book lovers, writers, and students are encouraged to join our meetings. Whether you are a novice writer, who needs feedback, criticism, or even proof-reading; or an accomplished writer, who would like to see how your writing will be accepted by the public and how people will be impacted by your writing; or a student working on a research paper for school; in all cases, we encourage you to submit your writing and join our meet-up group. Hopefully, these original pieces will also stimulate discussion relevant to diverse Asian communities in NY and the immigrant and international experience that is NYC.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of writing are encouraged: short stories, poems, articles or essays. There will also be opportunities for peer-to-peer proofreading and also sharing your original writings with the group. There also maybe workshops on how to advance your research skills using our American library system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0And, finally, we hope to include events and activities that will allow our members to explore the city and get to know each other better. Events such as book readings and signings, dinners, or events at the Asian American Writers Workshop, or visits to interesting but obscure used bookstores, will be included. Our Meetups will be in warm environments like city parks or cafes in Queens. Since we are new, we may change the format as we cater to the ever changing needs of our members.<\/p>\n<p>Important:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0When submitting request to join please upload a real picture of yourself - otherwise your membership will be rejected.

We know the fear that bubbles up every time we're asked our name, or need help finding an address, ordering food, or even just meeting an old friend. We go to therapy- some of us for years- spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars- trying to free our words.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even with every physical skill in the book at our disposal, however, \u00a0something's missing. \u00a0We're still not convinced we have a right to share, loud and clear, the stories, opinions, and quirks that make us who we are. That's because the key to a full life isn't in the hour-a -week spent in the clinic support group, trying to pour your heart out in the three minutes you have before someone starts getting antsy. Talking about what's going on inside certainly has its place in the therapy process, but lasting change can only come from <i>living loudly<\/i>- actually going out into the world and communicating, on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>That's why I (we ) started NYFS. We're planning on regular ( once a week to two weeks) meetups- some just to hang out, and some structured in such a way that we each face a particular type of communication challenge, with the support of the group behind us. This desensitizes us to the fear of disfluent speech,; the fear of being different.<\/p>\n<p>Examples include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Going into a department store and asking where you might find the dinner plates<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 \u00a0Asking a bus driver for directions as people are getting on ( to help experience time pressure)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Placing complicated pizza orders over the phone.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Talking to a member of the opposite ( or same) sex that you'd like to get to know better, romantically or otherwise<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Talking to a stranger in the park about what you're doing and what stuttering is exactly ( you'd be surprised at how receptive most people are to it!)<\/p>\n<p>Now, we know that everyone is in a different place with their stuttering. That's why, for the first few weeks, we'll be splitting people into groups based on what they're comfortable with- Easy, Medium, and Difficult challenges.

So grab your imagination and come and join us for a day of adventuring.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XNIWt_-C7RY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XNIWt_-C7RY&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Visit our website: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/vanguardlarpnyc.wix.com\/vanguard\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/vanguardlarpnyc.wix.com\/vanguard<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/6\/8\/highres_403572392.jpeg","photo_id":403572392,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/6\/8\/600_403572392.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/6\/8\/thumb_403572392.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128344662,"name":"Dan"},"members":98,"name":"Vanguard LARP","id":16603722,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-LARP","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Vanguard Larpers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1409050762000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"shopping","name":"Shopping","id":9349},{"urlkey":"naturalhair","name":"Natural Hair","id":9754},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"black-women","name":"Black Women","id":18634},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"black-business","name":"Black Business","id":24825},{"urlkey":"african-american","name":"African Americans","id":35203},{"urlkey":"black-men","name":"Black Men","id":35666},{"urlkey":"discover-your-neighborhood","name":"Discover Your Neighborhood","id":47316},{"urlkey":"local-business","name":"Local Business","id":78761}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Discover-Black-Business\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p><strong>This group&nbsp;is for people of all backgrounds interested in exploring the variety of black-owned businesses that the city has to offer, through fun, casual visits that give an opportunity to browse, learn, shop, support and meet the people behind the businesses.<\/strong> We also visit vendor fairs that bring together online and brick-and-mortar black-owned businesses, along with dining at restaurants from across the diaspora.
