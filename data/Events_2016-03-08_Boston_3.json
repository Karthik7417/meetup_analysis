We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away.

Please Use Street Parking.Price:\u00a0$5.00\u00a0\/per person<\/p> <p>Are you interested in learning how to Raise your Energy Vibrations?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Because we see the world from a physical perspective, we often don't notice what's right in front of us \u2014 that our spirit, thoughts, emotions, and body are all made of energy. Inside us and everywhere around us, life is vibrating. In fact, each of us has a personal vibration that accurately communicates who we are to the world and helps shape our reality. The Book Frequency by Penny Pierce shows readers how to feel their personal vibration, improve it, and use it to shift their life from ordinary to extraordinary. A simple shift in frequency can change depression to peace, anger to stillness, and fear to enthusiasm.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Frequency<\/i>\u00a0gives readers a reassuring, step-by-step roadmap into a positive state of awareness that Peirce calls The Intuition Age. By learning to use \"frequency principles\" \u2014 methods based on the way energy actually functions \u2014 readers can keep their energy level high and productive, receive subtle information directly from the environment via \"empathic resonance,\" and quickly free themselves from negative or low \"vibrations.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join us for a LoA Book Conversation and feel your vibrations Rise!<\/p> <p>Frequency is about 250 pages, we will review Chapters 1-6 in this meetup and the remainder next month.<\/p> <p>This will be an open forum style book review, highly recommended to take notes while reading to share your highlights\/low lights.<\/p> <p>Frequency gives readers the tools to understand how and why their natural frequency interacts with the world around them.<\/p> <p>Weaving together basic ideas from quantum physics with proven intuition development techniques, Frequency takes readers into deeper concepts only hinted at in recent popular books and DVD's featuring the Law of Attraction. By learning to refine the \"conscious sensitivity\" of their body, readers can improve relationships, find upscale solutions to problems, and materialize a life that contains everything they want and need to live their destiny.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Facilitators: Ellen Sklaver &amp; Sue Collins\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/228945348\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Frequency by Penny Pierce - How to raise your vibrations & LOA","id":"228945348","time":1457049600000,"updated":1457062471000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Winchester","address_1":"626 Main street","name":"Chamber of Comics","lon":-71.137413,"id":24241611,"state":"MA","lat":42.453518,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.33476209641,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455660771000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Coming in June, DC is going to relaunch their titles with number 1's.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The body is literally the temple of the soul, and the heart is the gateway in the temple. In a culture that is often cerebral, fast-paced and externally driven, we are often not taught to listen to our bodies for guidance and how to use the heart as the compass for our lives. In this workshop, incorporating heart meditation and body-centered exercises, we will have a chance to explore and listen to our inner resources and our natural soul-based guidance system: our body and heart.<\/p> <p>A donation is welcome.<\/p> <p>Linda Marks, MSM, has taught and practiced heart-centered body psychotherapy (Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy) for 30 years, working with individuals, couples, families and groups.

Phakchok Rinpoche\u2019s primary root gurus are his grandfather, the late Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, and late Kyabje Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Phakchok Rinpoche has received a traditional education from the Dzongsar Shedra in India, the complete Chokling New Treasures lineage from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and Kyabje Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, and the Great Perfection lineage from Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche. Rinpoche\u2019s teaching style is direct, addressing the needs of those present; traditional, not compromising the methods of practice and transmission in the slightest; and, accessible, teaching the profound meaning in a way that is able to be understood and glimpsed by people of diverse backgrounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As a yogi practitioner with a family and the responsibility of monastic institutions, Rinpoche is deeply familiar with both ways of life and practice. Rinpoche\u2019s life defines what it means to be a dharma practitioner in today\u2019s world by emphasising that a practitioner should find a balance in their life. There should be a base of study and contemplation in order to understand the profound views of the Buddhas teachings, and practice should be emphasized in a way that genuinely reduces ego clinging and negative emotions through a range of methods and practices. Altruistic activity should address the needs of those in one\u2019s community and beyond as an expression of the compassion and wisdom cultivated in practice.

Anyone of game-playing age who is interested in playing board games is welcome.<\/p> <p>The Quarterly will take place in the Commons and Walden function rooms at the hotel. Yes, two function rooms for this one! I believe the Commons will be able to seat approximately 120 and\u00a042 in the Walden for a total of\u00a0162 seats. Get all your friends on board and let\u2019s try to outgrow these rooms too!<\/p> <p>=============<\/p> <p>Commons Room<\/p> <p>=============<\/p> <p>The Commons room is a large function room the size of most of the rooms we have used for previous Quarterlies. This will be where the bulk of the open gaming will occur.<\/p> <p>=============<\/p> <p>Walden Room<\/p> <p>=============<\/p> <p>The Walden room is a smaller function room and will be able to seat approximately 25. This room will be reserved for scheduled games, scheduled teaching games, and games that need a quieter space away from the rumble and outbursts of the large open gaming area in the Commons. Please, play party games in the Commons instead of the Walden.<\/p> <p>===============<\/p> <p>Room Layout (Draft)<\/p> <p>===============<\/p> <p>Here is the room layout that I have instructed the hotel to work with.\u00a0 It is not final, because I was just informed that part of the Commons is shaped a bit different.\u00a0 All of the tables should\u00a0 still fit, but I am not going to know for sure until the day of the event.\u00a0 Also, the water station in the lobby will be moved to counter space available inside the Commons.<\/p> <p>The layout of the Walden is final.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/c\/0\/600_447246848.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>============================<\/p> <p>Pre-Registration (Online Registration)<\/p> <p>============================<\/p> <p>You purchase your pre-registrations for $8 per person at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/market\/TGA\/tga-q-all-day-quarterly-pre-registration-2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/market\/TGA\/tga-q-all-day-quarterly-pre-registration-2\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/squareup.com\/market\/TGA\/tga-q-all-day-quarterly-pre-registration-2<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>After check-out, your name and\/or e-mail address will be added to the pre-registration list.

Although this year's event is more focused on technology than our usual events, CodeAcross will always be open to the entire community: Community involvement and inclusion are extremely important to us, and our best projects always have a mix of technical and non-technical team members.<\/p> <p>We can't wait to see you all for a couple days of learning, teaching, collaborating, and civic hacking!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/stage.codeforboston.org\/img\/code_for_boston_logo.png\" \/><\/p> <p><b>CodeAcross would not be possible without the generosity of the following organizations:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/96\/Microsoft_logo_%282012%29.svg\/2000px-Microsoft_logo_%282012%29.svg.png\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.stlpm.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/VentureCafeLogo170w.png\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnvar\/20130910\/SF76762LOGO\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnvar\/20130910\/SF76762LOGO<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Code-for-Boston\/events\/228872132\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":111600000,"name":"CodeAcross 2016","id":"228872132","time":1457190000000,"updated":1457303092000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364557939000,"name":"Code for Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":7832132,"urlname":"Code-for-Boston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Civic Innovators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"99 Sherman St","name":"Danehy Park","lon":-71.132736,"id":17757972,"state":"MA","lat":42.390476,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.84058666229,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452946877000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as we us move our bodies and fire up our imaginations to explore the park in a new way. \u00a0This is an activity you'll use again and again when you are out (or even stuck in) with your family.<\/p> <p>(This is the first day of a two-day workshop.

To fully understand why we are hosting this charity, you must first understand her story:<\/p> <p>\n\nFrom her sister, Sofia Hart:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"Olivia always thrived to do the best she could. Being gifted with horse back riding as our hobby (or life passion) growing up, she was incredibly fearless and passionate with everything in her. She was also happy to be a Vineyarder during her years playing Hockey and Soccer, representing the place she loved most, home. Her determination was unstoppable on and off horse back, the field, and the ice. These characteristics followed her through her life growing into adulthood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nAs a recent University of Vermont graduate, she did just the same in her studies. When she felt defeated, she would do everything in her power to figure out what went wrong, and how she could fix her mistakes. While at her graduation, tears of joy were brought to my eyes as she smiled receiving her achievements and laughed and hugged with friends. Not only was she proud of herself, but she was even more proud of the people who surrounded her and their accomplishments too.<\/p> <p>\n\nThese qualities and characteristics went even further into the workplace. As a former employee of the Homeport Resturant, she used the skills and experience she learned there and carried it to the Seafood Shanty. Each and every job she has held has meant so much to her. Good days and bad days, she always would talk so highly of her job, especially for how dedicated she was to each establishment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThrough hardwork, fearlessness, dedication and most importantly, love, Olivia has gained a rather admirable reputation growing up on Martha's Vineyard for 22 years, and at UVM during her college years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThese amazing qualities and characteristics have not diminished one bit during these tough times. Her spirit is incredibly high, and she shocks us on a daily basis how positive her attitude is. I can not imagine being in her place, and handling the news she gets on a daily basis. Although she has received bad news many times, her positive outlook has not changed. Olivia is determined as ever, looking toward the brightest future.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nHere is more on Olivias condition, with a post from her Facebook page:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"So here it is. On the 9th I was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and diagnosed with a condition known as cardiomyopathy which is a disease of the heart muscle. There is damage to both the right and left portions but the majority of the damage is in the left ventricle. It wasn't until I had a cardiac MRI that the doctors realized my condition was most likely irreversible. The doctors believe it either began years ago when I most likely contracted a viral infection that attacked my heart or may have been something I was born with... the overall cause is unknown. My age enabled me to live and thrive with the condition until a couple of months ago. Currently, I am in the process of being placed on the heart transplant list, which I will hopefully be accepted to by the end of the week, and will receive a new heart by the start of the new year. For now that is about all that we know.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Important Information:<\/p> <p>\n\nWhen - October 31st, 11:00am<\/p> <p>\n\nWhat to bring - This will be a costume workout, so please wear an AWESOME halloween costume.

Lieberman<\/p> <p>Runtime: 110 minutes<\/p> <p>Released in USA, 2015<\/p> <p>Nina Simone nee Eunice Waymon, was left out of Civil Rights history, erased by jazz critics, and\u00a0forgotten by most Americans because no one knew how to categorize her\u00a0greatness. \u00a0But throughout the 1960s, Nina Simone was both loved and feared for her outspoken vision of Black Freedom. \u00a0Her musical proclamations like \"Mississippi Goddam\", and her iconic style gave voice to people of all colors\u00a0facing oppression, and continues to empower today with its unrelenting appeal for justice. Today, Nina is more popular eleven years after her death than ever before. President Barack Obama listed \u2018Sinnerman\u2019 in his top 5 favorite songs, and whether re-mixed, re-sampled or in its pure form, Nina\u2019s music continues to empower people around the world with its unrelenting appeal for justice.\u00a0Now the story of America's most overlooked musical genius is finally brought to light in the acclaimed new documentary film, \u201cThe Amazing Nina Simone.\u201d<\/p> <p>Director Jeff L. Lieberman (\u201dRe-Emerging: The Jews of Nigeria\u201d) brings audiences on Nina\u2019s journey from the segregated South, through the worlds of classical music, jazz joints &amp; international concert halls.

She is a Shamanic Practicioner, Legally Certified Spiritual Healer, Reiki Certified And Professionally Certified Sound Healer. Sarah leads retreats, workshops, Sound Healing classes, group sessions and offers private healings. Her focus is to help people come into their power, overcome challenges, releasing past emotional traumas, stress and anxiety reduction as well as soothing physical pain. Sarah has had beautiful responses to working on issues surrounding infertility, hormonal imbalance, anxiety, grief, depression and emotional traumas. Sarah travels extensively to pursue her studies, share the magic of sound as a healing tool and to recharge and continue her spiritual nomadic path in service and dedication.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/2\/f\/600_446467215.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Reviews:<\/p> <p><br\/>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood! \u00a0Sara you are an angel among angels.\u00a0I am grateful. Thank you<\/p> <p>\u00a02. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>3. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>4. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>5. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/228959051\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":5400000,"name":"Relaxing and Meditative Sacred Sound Bath","id":"228959051","time":1457220600000,"updated":1457227328000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Tewksbury","address_1":"305 Lancaster Dr.","name":"Sue's house","lon":-71.214508,"id":24408064,"state":"MA","lat":42.623093,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.6523685455,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452962552000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello All,\u00a0<\/p> <p>Looking to beat the winter blues?

Conductor Yoichi Udagawa will educate audiences from the stage about the genius of these composers and their masterworks. You will hear three phenomenal works:<\/p> <p>R\u00f3zsa - Parade of the Charioteers from \"Ben Hur\"<\/p> <p>R\u00f3zsa - Sinfonia Concertante, Op. 29<br\/>with Boston Symphony musicians, Lucia Lin, violin &amp; Owen Young, cello<\/p> <p>Beethoven - Symphony No. 5<\/p> <p>The concert highlights powerfully emotional and passionate music from film composer Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, opening with his \u201cParade of the Charioteers\u201d from the 1959 movie Ben Hur. R\u00f3zsa won three Oscars and composed nearly 100 film scores including Ben Hur, Spellbound, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, and Double Indemnity.<\/p> <p><br\/>In addition to film scores, R\u00f3zsa also composed traditional concert music such as his Sinfonia Concertante written for violin and cello soloists with orchestra. The MSO is excited to welcome back acclaimed Boston Symphony musicians violinist Lucia Lin and cellist Owen Young to perform this exciting and evocative work.<\/p> <p><br\/>Closing the concert is perhaps the most recognizable piece in all symphonic literature with its famous \u00a0four-note introduction: Beethoven\u2019s monumental \u201c5th Symphony.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/228945427\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"20 Free Tickets for a \u201cNight Out at the Symphony\u201d MELROSE","id":"228945427","time":1457222400000,"updated":1457260277000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02476","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Arlington","address_1":"730 Massachusetts Avenue","name":"Arlington Town Hall","lon":-71.156227,"id":8972682,"state":"MA","lat":42.41568,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.85702133179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457098989000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Last year ArlingtonEATS and the 300+ volunteers who make the program possible, provided more than 5000 summer meals, served over 7000 snacks and distributed over 34,000 pounds of fresh produce and rescued food for the weekends to Arlington families.

Think of it as using a paint brush of light to illuminate existing surfaces. You emphasize the objects.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light drawing: this is where you point the light at the camera and draw up shapes and figures. You create new objects, background may be secondary or complementary.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light writing: the same as drawing, except that you write actual words or do light calligraphy. Very specialized and quite difficult to do well, we will not go much into this. You create messages, the background becomes secondary.<\/p> <p>Here is a rough outline of what will be covered:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Basic settings: what's different from regular NPy?<\/p> <p>\u00a0 - adding light to fill in dark shadows (equalize)<\/p> <p>\u00a0 - adding light as a major (and visible) component (emphasize)<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light sources for light painting:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 - flashlights: LED, incandescent, light colors<\/p> <p>\u00a0 - flashes<\/p> <p>\u00a0 - light gadgets: trip to the toy store, anyone?<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light modifiers: reflectors, snoots, baffles, gel filters and paint brushes<\/p> <p>\u2022 What makes an object look interesting? Hint: it's shadows!<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The basic concepts:<\/p> <p>\u2022 How to \u2022 Light Painting: how to convert a flashlight into a paint brush<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light Drawing: unleash your arteestic side<\/p> <p>\u2022 Light Writing: calligraphy, anyone?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The three secrets to becoming a master in this.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/1\/6\/600_446446870.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/228514654\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"duration":7200000,"name":"Lecture: Introduction to Light Painting","id":"228514654","time":1457224200000,"updated":1457310681000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"1 Guest Street","name":"WGBH","lon":-71.148499,"id":24262576,"state":"MA","lat":42.356686,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.02260017395,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450504168000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>SOLD OUT !!!Travel back in time to the 1920's and experience the sights, sounds and tastes of Britain's high society. 1920's formal attire welcomed!<br\/>*Tickets for this event must be purchased separate to RSVPing here.

However, any time estimate given by an Event Organizer is just that. Actual times vary greatly according to weather, trail conditions and the group itself. Don't sign up if you've scheduled something later in the day. The Organizer is not responsible for getting you back in time. \nThere is no way of knowing trail conditions ahead of time. Use your own judgment. Anyone with recurrent \"No Shows\" or about whom we have received complaints from fellow hikers will not be accepted.<\/p> <p>If you haven't hiked with us before, add yourself to the list if you can adhere to these basic prerequisites. Please don't RSVP \"Yes\" unless you really intend to come. We are committed to being there for you. If you are not equally committed to being there then please don't sign up.\n\n<\/p> <p>This hike is rated easy\/moderate.\u00a0 You should be able to stay with the group going at a pace of 2+ mph. This is a group event and participants are expected to follow the leader, stay together, stop at junctions or summits, and support all participants should circumstances require teamwork. We start together and finish together. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own. We hike in light rain or showers, but heavy snow or extreme cold weather cancels. Bring water, hiking boots (not sneakers), bug spray and lunch\/snacks. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.\n\n<\/p> <p>NO DOGS and NO GUESTS are allowed on this hike. Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.Please remember that your Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults. The people who have the best times on these hikes are those who stay loose and roll with things as they happen.

Have a favorite recipe that you\u2019ve made for family and friends? Or perhaps there\u2019s a recipe you\u2019ve bookmarked (or several), and you need an excuse to try it out. Well, you and your fellow cookbook collectors are the perfect dinner guests to experiment with.<\/p> <p><br\/>Let\u2019s come together and experience for ourselves the tried and true recipes from the folks at Cook\u2019s Illustrated and America\u2019s Test Kitchen.

Join our Meetup group! All cooking levels are welcome. Don't be shy . . . you\u2019re in good hands.<\/p> <p>2. RSVP via Meetup. Each of our \u201cFeast\" events are on the 1st Sunday of every month, focusing on a different cookbook, author or blog. Everything is organized by me, but you're more than welcome to offer suggestions of some of your favorite cookbooks. <b>Note ::<\/b> If you RSVP YES and wind up being a \u201cNo Show\u201d without any prior notice, I have to be honest and say that won\u2019t work for this group. Please double check your calendar and make sure you can actually attend the event. Seating is limited for my events, and I wouldn\u2019t want a spot to be held up when there\u2019s an active wait list of members eager to sign up. I feel bad asking that, but at the same time, it\u2019s kind of flattering if you think about it. What an active group we have, yay!<\/p> <p>3. Skim through your myriad of Cook\u2019s Illustrated magazines (or scroll through their website) and experiment with a few of the recipes that interest you. You\u2019ll need to pick only one recipe for our Feast. Good luck narrowing it down!<\/p> <p>4. You now have your recipe selected. Bravo! Be sure to read through all of the instructions to make sure you have the proper equipment, dishes, and ingredients. (I made that mistake at a previous Feast.) If you have time, you might want to do a test run with the recipe ahead of time. Some of our seasoned members take the time to try one or more recipes out before making their final selection (they are way more dedicated than me\u2014and I love it).<\/p> <p>5. In the <b>Comments Section<\/b> below, share which recipe you will be bringing, which magazine or book it is from, or paste the link from the Cook\u2019s Illustrated website. I'll keep track of what everyone is bringing and make sure we don't have any overlaps. <b>Note ::<\/b> It might be wise to pick a backup recipe in case your 1st choice is already taken.<\/p> <p>6. Day of the event. Prepare your recipe according to the directions provided in the cookbook. <i>As tempting as it might be to alter the recipe or make a substitution, please follow the instructions as closely as possible.<\/i> This will allow the group to truly experience the author's array of recipes. I'll bring salt + pepper, just in case. <b>Note ::<\/b> Don\u2019t worry about doubling or tripling the recipe. With over 20 different dishes to sample from, we will have more than enough food for everyone.<\/p> <p>7. Please <b>print and bring 25 copies<\/b> of your chosen recipe. Not everyone will have a copy of the book or magazine you are using. Providing a copy of each recipe will make our Feast all the more inclusive, and allow people to highlight their favorites. Post-it notes and pencils provided.<\/p> <p>8. Come with an open heart and empty stomach! At my events, strangers quickly become new foodie friends with a shared passion for cooking. Together we will Feast on your wonderful food and talk about our cooking experiences. Gain new inspiration and learn from one another.<\/p> <p>9. If you feel inspired to bring fancier serving dishes (for photos), I won't stop you! But it's not essential . . . just a little more fun.<\/p> <p>10.

There's no guarantee your dish will remain HOT by the time we are ready to eat. Consider recipes that travel well, and can also can be served at room temperature. Either way, you're welcome to bring your own heating elements, crock pots, or warmers. I just can't guarantee there will always be an outlet accessible.<\/p> <p><br\/>3.

E. B. Du Bois, Cornel West, and others who confronted the \"color line\" of the twentieth century, journalist, scholar, and activist Frank H. Wu offers a unique perspective on how changing ideas of racial identity will affect race relations in the twenty-first century. Wu examines affirmative action, globalization, immigration, and other controversial contemporary issues through the lens of the Asian-American experience. Mixing personal anecdotes, legal cases, and journalistic reporting, Wu confronts damaging Asian-American stereotypes such as \"the model minority\" and \"the perpetual foreigner.\" By offering new ways of thinking about race in American society, Wu's work dares us to make good on our great democratic experiment.<\/i><\/p> <p>.......................<\/p> <p>After our last book discussion, we decided to continue the dynamic of being responsible to present a part of the book.\u00a0 We will all do our best to read the whole book, and then each choose a chapter to present about.\u00a0 Plan for about five minutes of time.\u00a0 Here are some ideas of things you might include in your presentation (choose any or do something else!):<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Summarize the chapter.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What was especially important for you about this chapter?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What questions did the chapter raise for you?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Share a quote from the chapter.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Make a connection to another book or resource.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Create and share an artistic response to the chapter.<\/p> <p>Please post the number for your chapter in the comments section below.\u00a0 It's fine if you choose the same chapter as another person, though we'd like to be sure at least one person presents about each chapter.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Because of space limitations, a maximum of 16 people can attend.

This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

This is powerful work, ably and lovingly brought forward by Karin &amp; Mark who effortlessly guided us to access inner territory and uncover gifts buried there. I was surprised by how many tears came as a result of taking part in this work.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/228906289\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvfbkb","time":1457395200000,"updated":1457407741000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Rockland","address_1":"12 Church Street","name":"First Congregational Church","lon":-70.914795,"id":24385556,"state":"MA","lat":42.13015,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":17.7907981873,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456869816000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come &amp; join us for Monday night Square Dancing in ROCKLAND. 7:30 to 9:30 Come &amp; enjoy Mainstream level dances with veteran caller Bill White.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/228950113\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvfbkb","time":1457397000000,"updated":1457442489000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brookline","address_1":"646 Brookline Ave","name":"Boston Shambhala Center","lon":-71.113411,"id":23059562,"lat":42.332909,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.90739893913,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454275840000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A weekly gathering bringing together Buddhist meditation practice and recovery.

The term mindfulness has become part of our everyday language, we talk about \"eating mindfully\", or \"trying to be more mindful in our consumer choices.\" Furthermore, the actual method of Mindfulness is taught in prisons and schools to reduce stress, it is taught by cognitive therapists to modify dysfunctional patterns of behavior, and it is practiced by corporate CEOs to enhance effectiveness in the workplace. In other words, we have co-opted mindfulness. We have extracted it from its original context and striped it of soteriological meaning. Worse, it has been turned into an elixir to promote the smooth functioning of our most destructive institutions. The word mindfulness comes from the Pali term sati and it is part of the eightfold path which the Buddha prescribed to end Dhaka, the stressful and disturbing mental constructions through which we view ourselves and others. Mindfulness, in this context, is the basis for insight into the true nature of reality, and according to the Buddhist tradition, when we \"wake up\" to the true nature of things, we realize that we are not in as bad shape as we thought. It's likened to waking up from a bad dream. Buddha is said to have become awakened through practicing mindfulness of the breath. In our weekly meetings we will practice basic mindfulness meditation and we will seek to understand how this practice fits within the framework of the Buddha's teachings. Each meeting will last about an hour and consist of brief meditation exercises and some discussion of the Buddha's radical approach to life.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center\/events\/228908860\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Meditate and discuss the Buddha's teachings","id":"jxtnqlyvfbkb","time":1457398800000,"updated":1457407479000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444180575000,"name":"Building Community @ Common Street Spiritual Center","group_lon":-71.3499984741,"id":19003287,"urlname":"Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Community Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brighton","address_1":"1960 Beacon St","name":"Cityside Bar","lon":-71.150505,"id":24001923,"lat":42.336353,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.43284273148,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456947113000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>EVERY Monday Comic InSite presents \u2018The Comedy Cage\u2019 at CitySide Comedy Club.
