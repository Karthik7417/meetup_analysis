Feel free to turnaround at any point or walk\/run at your own pace.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Details about the Saturday run<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Route:<\/b> We\u2019ll meet in front of the <b>Red Barn Bakery<\/b> (4 S. Astor St.) in Irvington and jog VERY casually together to the Old Croton Aqueduct trail. (If you are unfamiliar with the area and would prefer to walk rather than run to the trail, click <a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/qd7Vi\">here<\/a> to see the trail on a map.) From there we\u2019ll head south toward Dobbs Ferry. There is no set distance. Everyone will walk or run at their own pace for 25 minutes, and then turn around and come back. Please wear a watch so that you know when to turn around.<\/p> <p><b>Water\/Bag Storage:<\/b> There are very few water fountains along the route, so bring a water bottle if you need one while running. I\u2019ll bring water and cups for after the run. There\u2019s no bag storage, so leave belongings at home or in your car.<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b> In front of Red Barn Bakery (4 S. Astor St, Irvington, NY 10533).

During the 45 minutes or so that we're underway, we walk in silence, slowly, and pay attention to life. Sometimes we stop and sit and close our eyes. Other times we walk in silence and let the fact that we're alive (and conscious of it) sink in.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>That's no small thing, to let consciousness observe and take good care of itself. Another term for it is: waking up!<\/p> <p><br\/>You have to ask yourself: when was the last time that you took the time to slow down and look and savor--<i>actually look and savor--<\/i>the world manifesting around us? Sometimes when you answer that question honestly, you will say: I haven't really done that since I was a child.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you've ever observed Heights Meditation members walking through our Washington Heights neighborhood on one of our silent meditative walks, you'll have seen a group of people picking their way across the city landscape, stopping occasionally to sit in front of a river or an empty playground or a wall of yellow bricks. You'll have heard the gently jangling cow bell, the only sound we make as we move across a piece of northern Manhattan.

A bit of this information will, of course, depend on our numbers, so please pretty please RSVP.<\/p> <p>Why Cool Beans?<\/p> <p>Given the fact that our numbers grew on their own, I wanted to be able to accommodate as many of us as possible for this first meeting. Cool Beans offers the most flexibility for this purpose, though for future meetups we can certainly explore other venues.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Wouldn't you like to know?

We'll go over the difference between the 2-component spinors used in non-relativistic quantum mechanics and the 4-component Dirac spinors used in QFT. The way in which these can be represented by the so-called \"gamma matrices\" which form a Clifford Algebra. The plane-wave solutions to the Dirac equation. And finally, why the cancellation of particle and antiparticle fermion propagators necessary to preserve causality requires that the creation and annihilation operators for fermions anti-commute rather than commute. (The last point is a follow up to the previous lecture a month ago on the \"spin statistics theorem\" and will serve as part 2 of this topic.)<br\/>DIRECTIONS:<\/p> <p>From NYC by car: take the Holland Tunnel; after tunnel at 2nd traffic light turn left into Marin Blvrd; 1st traffic light turn left into 6th street\/Thomas Gangemi Dr; 3rd traffic light turn right into Washington Blvrd; 2nd traffic light turn left into 2nd street; the Portofino is the 1st building on the right.

These three mind states create most of the suffering and dissatisfaction in our lives. Along with discussing each of those states we will be spending alternate\u00a0weeks on the paired, but contrasting mind states that are free from suffering and dissatisfaction. This week, following up on our discussion of Delusion and Ignorance, we will turn our attention to the contrasting mind state of Wisdom.<\/p> <p>We most often think of Wisdom as our accumulated learned, factual knowledge and our experience brought to bear on living. In our consideration of Wisdom's relationship to Ignorance and Delusion, however, Buddhist teachings focus on some distinct\u00a0elements of \"the truth of the way things are\" that are fundamental to freeing ourselves from suffering and dissatisfaction.<\/p> <p>Among those primary elements of Wisdom from the teachings is (1) having a deep, personal understanding\u00a0that suffering is part of life, that\u00a0its causes are known and that\u00a0there can be an end to it, (2) seeing that nothing exists separately or in isolation but is rather a\u00a0cumulative result of many causes and conditions, and (3) knowing that nothing, beyond awareness\u00a0itself, is fixed and stable and unchangeable.<\/p> <p>It is important to highlight that there is also a transformative process in Wisdom. When working with these negative and positive states, the final realization of freedom requires a transformation from the \"thinking about\" \u00a0the teachings, inherited beliefs, and simple intellectual facts into a real, deep level of personal insight that arises from direct, lived experience with the states.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

He expanded the possibilities of drawing, created surfaces with a heightened sense of tactility, and invented new means for new subjects, from dancers in motion to the radiance of electric light, from women in intimate settings to meteorological effects in nature.<\/p> <p><br\/>The monotype also sparked a host of experiments for Degas, who often used the medium as a starting point from which an image could be reworked and revised. This process of repetition and transformation, mirroring and reversal, allowed Degas to extend his approach to the study of form. The profound impact of his work with monotype can be seen in his variations in different mediums of key motifs, revealing a new kind of artwork that was less about progress or completion than endless innovation.<\/p> <p><br\/>----------<\/p> <p><br\/>Attendees are responsible for paying for any purchases from Starbucks, and for the special $5 guest rate to enter MOMA on my membership pass.\u00a0 That's right, you will save $20 vs. the normal $25 admission price!\u00a0<\/p> <p>If something comes up and you can't attend, please change your RSVP status as soon as possible.\u00a0 Given the small size of this meetup group, no-show's would be a big loss.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet inside Starbucks at 1290 Sixth Ave, entrance on 52nd St, between 5th & 6th Ave.  I will display a red Meetup sign.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Experience-Share-Group\/events\/229978886\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Connect by Seeing the Degas Monotype Exhibit at MOMA","id":"229978886","time":1460214000000,"updated":1460236086000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391144665000,"name":"NYC Experience Share Group for 40-Somethings & 50-Somethings","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12625032,"urlname":"NYC-Experience-Share-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NYConnectors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Lyndhurst","address_1":"306 Ridge Rd","name":"Lyndhurst Meditation Center","lon":-74.118797,"id":24163110,"state":"NJ","lat":40.808285,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.86616849899,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455413525000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is an open house and introduction to\u00a0Lyndhurst Meditation.

Have you had some type of contact with some unseen paranormal phenomenon? Is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu a common occurrence for you? These are just a few events that you yourself may have experienced unwittingly, yet you can train yourself to connect to these energies on demand. This book is intended to take you through the first 18 months of the author's journey into the incredible realm of energy sensitivity. It serves as an account of the amazing insights, visions, and events that he has experienced, first with his exploration of Reiki and then with his steps into developing mediumship.<\/p> <p>Many scientific theories around light, matter, and energy support the notions of reading and manipulating the energy fields around people as well as connecting to the energy of Spirit. The author also describes the repeatable procedures he has created for testing his sensitivity, strengthening the credibility of the phenomena. The book proposes that there are several relationships between science and these esoteric practices through the law of energy conservation. Evaluating the incredible experiences and events through the logical eyes of a technical engineer, the author openly wrestles with some of the challenges he faced with accepting the reality of these phenomena in the face of the evidence received.<\/p> <p>While the book is not meant to be an instructional manual to provide training in these fields, it does include some of the basic techniques the author has learned in his own training and subsequent practices. Anyone can embark on this journey of detecting and interacting with various types of metaphysical energy. The journey of spiritual evolution awaits; maybe it's time for you to test your potential.<\/p> <p>Jeff will be on hand afterward to sign a copy of his book if you are interested in picking one up after the talk. This event is especially for those of you out there who are \"scientific\" in nature and would like some insight into how your intuition can be proven by science.<\/p> <p>Jeff trained at the Center and was certified as a Reiki Master.

You will walk away with techniques that can be integrated into the busiest of schedules. \u00a0 Suggested $10 donation.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Meditation-for-Health-Meetup\/events\/230144353\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Introduction to Meditation Workshop","id":"230144353","time":1460217600000,"updated":1460222209000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435774518000,"name":"New York Meditation for Health Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18712357,"urlname":"New-York-Meditation-for-Health-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Healthy Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07033","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Kenilworth","address_1":"14 Michigan Avenue","name":"Wildpig Comics","lon":-74.286171,"id":16236662,"state":"NJ","lat":40.676754,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3489341736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1456001971000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join DM Noah Anderson the first D&amp;D 5E Module!<\/p> <p>The Sword Coast is under siege.

Yes, it does exist. Gun Hill Brewery has been building a quiet following for a few years now. Being a Bronx native I am happy to have something as ubiquitous as beer to call our own. Coming up to the most neglected borough in NYC will get you a tour of this magnificent brewery and a chance to marinate in their tap tasting room where we will get glugging samples of some of the best beers that Gun Hill Brewery has to offer. All of their brews are handcrafted and they do some amazing experiments to create the flavors that we will be imbibing on.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/5\/3\/600_447456435.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Their flavor profiles sound amazing (as you will see below) and you are able to take growlers home with you containing the flavors of your choosing. Prepare to be happily inebriated in The BX. This will be just one reason for you to come back to the BX if you are not a native. The second reason is as follows...<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/a\/8\/600_447456520.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>West Indian\/Caribbean fare is dominant out here in the North East Bronx. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roti\">Roti<\/a>, borrowed from Indian culture and modified slightly to accommodate Caribbean tastes is a food that I have grown up with all my life. When you say the word roti in my family you know it's a meal in of itself that you are talking about and not a simple piece of bread to accompany an entree. The Caribbean roti is an entree all on its own that one can nom'd on for two - three separate meals pending on the greed factor.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/a\/6\/600_447456518.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhat you are looking at is basically a huge delicious curried meat or veggie wrap-like sandwich with the bread being an Indian Roti flat bread rolled and packed with the food of your choosing.

The flavors, sit still fresh in my mind from decades ago so I can't wait to share this with you all in kind. Frank has had Roti before but not this one.

Also feel free to bring any reference material that will help out with the theme in addition to what will be provided.<\/p> <p>You can find me at the tables on the second floor of the Cranberry Cafe.<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there and having fun participating in this new style of meetup and exercising, challenging, or developing your drawing and conceptual skills with other imaginative artists throughout NYC. Any skill level and any style is welcomed!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Imaginative-Illustrators-Of-NYC\/events\/230165116\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":12600000,"name":"Lets Draw Together!

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>(photo of atrium and location of meetup table)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/4\/0\/600_433449280.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(photo of atrium entrance at the corner of 53rd and Lex.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty-five years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

Upon 2 members\u2019 recommendations, my wife and I, dined here recently and gave it 4 thumbs up. You will find that the accommodating and sumptuous ambiance makes for an unforgettable experience.

In this dynamic, interactive evening combining individual work with group process, you will learn techniques to liberate this energy and access more pleasure in your life. These techniques will be demonstrated through individual body readings with select participants who choose to take the risk of revealing a sexual issue and are willing to work through it in a supportive environment with expert guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid uses the teachings of Integral Evolutionary Tantra and the principles of Core Energetics to open up physical blocks and places where life energy doesn\u2019t move. In Integral Evolutionary Tantric teachings and in Core Energetics -- a powerful body-based process -- sexual energy and life force energy are one and the same. Join us with body readings, deep truth, wild goodness, radical personal transformation and, if you dare, the evolution of your own personal enlightenment.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i><b>Note:<\/b>\u00a0This workshop is for both couples and singles.

Based in Greenwich Village, the two celebrated, in 2015, their twentieth year as a married couple and and musical duo. Two decades on the road, both on their own and as members of Nanci Griffith's Blue Moon Orchestra, have led them to many venues, including Carnegie Hall, The Newport and Philadelphia Folk Festivals, and Royal Albert Hall in London. Prior to moving to New York City, they were based in Austin Texas, and Washington DC. In DC, they were Artists-in-Residence at The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and were the recipients of twenty Wammy awards, including \"Artists of the Year\". In 1993, Pete was awarded a Grammy certificate for his participation as lead guitarist on Nanci Griffith's \"Other Voices, Other Rooms\".\u00a0The Kennedy have released fifteen CDs, including three in 2015.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/p_JwY7YKJuc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/p_JwY7YKJuc<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Here's what folks are saying about The Kennedys ...<\/b><\/p> <p><i>JIM FARBER IS FLOORED BY THE KENNEDYS...Maura Kennedy's voice rests wistfully on music that makes Burt Bacharach-style somber pop.<\/i><br\/>Jim Farber - New York Daily News<\/p> <p><i>Byrdsy jangle and boy-girl harmonies...irresistible<\/i><br\/>Rolling Stone Magazine<\/p> <p><i>The Kennedys are worthy of the title First Couple of American Folk and Americana.<\/i><br\/>Lee Zimmeraman - No Depression<\/p> <p><i>Just in from one of the best gigs I have seen this year.

Their sound has been compared to Simon and Garfunkel and their antics have been compared to The Smothers Brothers, but their unique instrumentation and introspective lyrics put them in a category all their own. With Noah on ukulele\/vocals and Dan on acoustic guitar\/banjo\/vocals, The Lords have gained acclaim for their tight harmonies, innovative songwriting, and exuberant stage show.

Based in Greenwich Village, the two celebrated, in 2015, their twentieth year as a married couple and and musical duo. Two decades on the road, both on their own and as members of Nanci Griffith's Blue Moon Orchestra, have led them to many venues, including Carnegie Hall, The Newport and Philadelphia Folk Festivals, and Royal Albert Hall in London. Prior to moving to New York City, they were based in Austin Texas, and Washington DC. In DC, they were Artists-in-Residence at The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and were the recipients of twenty Wammy awards, including \"Artists of the Year\".

The film's disjointed framing device of a homeless cat weaving its way through the three stories (reportedly altered for the worse by post-production tampering) doesn't hold things together the way it should but the individual tales have plenty to offer in the way of chills and sly humor: \"Quitters, Inc.\" mixes some wry commentary on the self-help movement into its tale of a mysterious treatment center, \"The Ledge\" overcomes its pro-forma 'life-and-death bet' scenario with witty dialogue and colorful characterizations and the final untitled tale has plenty of fun playing with the audience's ideas about superstitions. The appeal of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/cats-eye-v8607\">Cat's Eye<\/a>\u00a0is further enhanced by inspired acting:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/drew-barrymore-p4289\">Drew Barrymore<\/a>\u00a0makes for a plucky, likable young heroine in the finale and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/robert-hays-p31305\">Robert Hays<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/kenneth-mcmillan-p47905\">Kenneth McMillan<\/a>\u00a0infuse their roles in \"The Ledge\" with a palpable sense of emotional desperation that gives the tale added depth. However, the big scene-stealers in the acting department are\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/james-woods-p117297\">James Woods<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/alan-king-p38254\">Alan King<\/a>, whose solid comic timing and willingness to act on the tale's darker conceits make \"Quitters, Inc.\" a blackly comedic winner. Director\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/lewis-teague-p113792\">Lewis Teague<\/a>\u00a0adds plenty of visual wit to the tales (avid Stephen King fans should look for all the film's references to his other works) and keeps things rolling at a speedy, suspenseful clip that is in keeping with the overall playful tone of the stories.

Along the way, we will cross the mighty( the George Washington Bridge) and the mundane ( the 103 rd Street Foot Bridge) , through neighborhoods which many of us have never been to or even know exist. We will start on the NYC side of the GW(1) and cross back and forth before heading north up the west side along the Hudson River before crossing the Henry Hudson Bridge(2) and entering the Fieldston section of The Bronx. We will then criss cross the between the various neighborhoods in The Bronx and Manhattan as we make our way south across the remaining Harlem River Bridges(3-11). At the Triboro Bridge(12), we will head down into Randall's Island\/Ward's Island. Since this is close to Riker's Island prison, I will try to time our arrival to coincide with visiting hours for those of you with friends and family incarcerated there. Just joking.<\/p> <p>We will then cross the 103rd Street Foot Bridge(13) back into Manhattan and then proceed along the East River until the 59th Street Bridge.(14). After crossing into Queens, we will make our way across the Pulaski Bridge-doesn't count- into Brooklyn until we reach the Williamsburg Bridge(15) which will take us back into Manhattan. We will continue downtown until we reach the Manhattan Bridge(16) which we will take back to Brooklyn and then the Brooklyn Bridge (17) back into Manhattan. The estimated time of the hike is about 10-11 hours. There will be 2-3 minute water breaks about every hour and a lunch break at The Highbridge point in Upper Manhattan. We will arrange further breaks as needed as we continue along the second half of the hike. There are multiple bailouts along the way as the subway is never more than 5-7 blocks away.When we ran this in December, we had 40 enthusiastic participants who completed various portions of the route with a significant number finishing. Come with your legs, heart, and mental commitment you will be rewarded with a very fulfilling experience and the energy from the group will enable you to cover distances you didn't think were possible.look forward to seeing you all.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Stephen Miller","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hvhikers\/events\/228971831\/","yes_rsvp_count":32,"name":"2016 URBAN HIKING SERIES Triple Crown Part 2-Cross all 17 Bridges of Manhattan!","id":"228971831","time":1460292300000,"updated":1460483645000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1229395389000,"name":"Hudson Valley Hikers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1338658,"urlname":"hvhikers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"HV Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":5,"created":1459823143000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please be there on time so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click here for our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Game style and Rules:<\/p> <p>1.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/230095603\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvgbnb","time":1460293200000,"updated":1460305305000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10805","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"Weyman Avenue & Pelham Rd","name":"Glen Island Park","lon":-73.785728,"id":15465462,"state":"NY","lat":40.89249,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.5554237366,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455986877000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Let's get together and participate in a walk for a cure for MS on Sunday April 10th - starting at 9am.

It is on the Port Washington line (red), and tickets cost $4.25 from Penn Station with a City Ticket on weekends which you must buy at a kiosk prior to getting on the train on the day of travel. Buying any ticket on the train will set you back quite a bit\u2026 like $15.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can also take Q13 from Flushing.

It is, perhaps, the most rewarding loop hike in the park, as it incorporates a number of scenic features and, for nearly the entire distance; you are far away from the noise of the Parkway.<\/p> <p>We\u2019re going to meet up at the State Line Cafe which is not far from the parking lot. Then we walk towards women\u2019s Federation Monument before we start our decent down to the river. After our decent down, we\u2019re going to go through some big boulders along the river for some awesome Rock Scrambling. We will take a rest and have some snack midpoint of the scramble then head towards the water fall. After spending some time at this interesting and beautiful spot, follow the white-blazed Shore Trail as it turns left, away from the river, and climbs on wooden steps and switchbacks. It parallels the stream leading to the waterfall for a short distance and soon ends at a junction with the aqua-blazed Long Path. Turn left onto the Long Path, which you will follow all the way back to the State Line Lookout.<\/p> <p>The Long Path crosses the stream on two wooden bridges. A short distance ahead, it turns sharply right and begins a steep climb on stone steps. At the top of the climb is High Gutter Point, a panoramic viewpoint up and down the river. To the north, you can see the Tappan Zee Bridge and Hook Mountain, the northernmost point on the Palisades along the Hudson. We\u2019ll take another break here before heading back to the parking lot.<\/p> <p>What to wear: You don't need to buy a new wardrobe before you hit the trail, but you'll need a few basics to stay safe and comfortable. While you don't need the most expensive gear, avoid cotton: it's a poor insulator when wet, making you feel colder and increasing your risk of hypothermia. Look for synthetic or wool materials instead.<\/p> <p>1. Base layer - this usually means a synthetic t-shirt and shorts.<\/p> <p>2. Warm, insulating layer \u2013 fleece jacket or wool sweater<\/p> <p>Socks: Hiking-specific socks offer more cushioning and breathability than cotton tube socks and protect them from blisters (particularly important on long hikes). 4. Back Pack - basic bag needs to be big enough to carry your food, water, extra clothes<\/p> <p>5. Gloves \u2013 You can get gardening gloves from home depot<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>1. At least 2L of water<\/p> <p>2. Snack and Lunch<\/p> <p>3. Hand sanitizer 4. Sunscreen and sunglasses<\/p> <p>5. First aid kit<\/p> <p>6.

At the same time, however, Rome of the last century BC flowered into an incubator for the revival of Latin literature and Greco-Roman philosophy. The pioneer writers in this new movement were men of a philosophical bent who sought practical ways to deal with all that was wrong in life. Cicero and Lucretius argued with consummate and persuasive style, one for traditional Roman Stoicism, and one for a liberating Epicurean materialism. A new lyric strain also began to take shape in the deeply emotional poetry of Catullus and the urbane and philosophical odes, satires and epistles of Horace. Elegiac poetry reached highest development in the work of Virgil and Ovid. Epic literature rivaling Homer's Odyssey was created by the great Virgil, as a capstone to the promise of the Pax Romana imposed by Augustus.

(Weather permitting.)<\/p> <p><b>About Featured Model Shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a new model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, use different sets and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned with a fourth look pending time. Weather permitting, we'll get to do some outdoor shooting. We'll keep it to glamour looks plus an implied look. (Swimwear, lingerie and sexy outerwear.) For outdoor shooting, feel free to bring your speed lights, reflectors and any modifiers to get shots in your preferred portable lighting setups. Indoors, we'll have our strobe and LED setups.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>We have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. So, please\u00a0only\u00a0sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit to hold your spot. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is\u00a0not\u00a0held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. All deposits need to be received immediately upon signup or within 5 days of the shoot or we will have to fill the unconfirmed spot\/s ASAP if there is a waitlist or cancel the shoot (existing deposits returned) if the minimum RSVP is not met. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">PayPal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox on the PayPal page as that adds the surcharge automatically. If we have to return a deposit for any reason, it will be less than originally deposited.)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Balance due at time of shoot:\u00a0$60<\/b>, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.<\/p> <p>Non-Commercial Release PDF will be emailed to you at the email address given on the sign in sheet.<\/p> <p><b>Model:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Dara:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/__flowerbomb__\/\">Instagram<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Photo Credits: NandoPro)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/e\/f\/600_448231983.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/2\/8\/600_448232040.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(Photos below sent by model for promotional purposes.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/229893511\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Featured Model: Glamour & Implied Shoot w\/Dara - April 10th","id":"229893511","time":1460304000000,"updated":1460315888000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Merrick","address_1":"1832 Ada Place  Merrick ny 11566","name":"Dave's Ranch","lon":-73.560356,"id":24265156,"state":"NY","lat":40.666046,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.2857189178,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459734520000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allman Brothers - \" In Memory of Elizabeth Reed \" - Part 2<\/p> <p>\u00a0Includes review , we add the 2nd guitar part .

This event will feature one of the rising stars of African (Nigerian) KALIN\u00c9.<\/p> <p>KALIN\u00c9 BIO<br\/>She is hard to miss with that impressive, unapologetic Diana Ross-esque mane but more than just a head of hair, Kalin\u00e9\u2019s voice is certainly one worth getting to know. The Nigerian-born singer\/songwriter and pianist whose clever threading of words and percussive style of piano playing is a direct product of her African roots. With a soulful elegance and funky flutter, she spreads her wings across a landscape of jazz, R\u2018n\u2019B, and Afrobeat to create an authentic, alternative sound.<\/p> <p>A graduate of Berklee College of music with a BMus in Film Scoring, she has a unique set of composition and production skills. In 2014, she released her first single and video \u2018Ololufemi\u2019 which garnered a lot of attention in Africa. Her most recent release (February, 2015) \u2018The Fires Of Red: Season One\u2019 is a body of work featuring 14 original songs and drawings (released over a period of 14 days) that serves as a visual songbook detailing a modern fictional drama. Several of her songs have been licensed for TV and film including \u2018Falling For You\u2019 licensed for the internationally acclaimed Nollywood movie \u2018Flower Girl\u2019 and TV series b430.<br\/>Among several performance opportunities, Kalin\u00e9 has opened for Bob James &amp; Fourplay, Chaka Khan, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Keziah Jones, Bez, Somi and Victor Olaiya.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/afrojam-brunch-tickets-22926910005\">TICKETS<\/a><\/p> <p>A strong advocate for social change, she has written a number of songs that address various social issues. \u2018Stand and Fight\u2019 that addresses domestic violence, won her 1st place in Berklee\u2019s \u2018Songwriting for Social Change\u2019 competition (2012). \u2018Bring Them Home\u2019 written in honor of the Chibok girls that were abducted in April, 2014 (including a music video) and \u2018Every Woman, Every Child\u2019 a theme song written for a UN- affiliated foundation of the same name (focusing on improving global women and children\u2019s health) are all part of her efforts to use her talent to shine a light on sensitive issues that affect our global community.<\/p> <p>Kalin\u00e9 recently performed the Nigerian National Anthem at The nigerian Embassy, D.C upon the arrival of President Muhammad Buhari.<\/p> <p>Visit her website for more information at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kalineofficial.com\">www.kalineofficial.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Social media: instagram: @kalineofficial Soundcloud.com\/kalineofficial<\/p> <p>Video:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DeIC9n147Oc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DeIC9n147Oc<\/a><\/p> <p>We have packages for groups, birthday and any special occasion.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

This fascia restriction can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting rotated key areas in weekly <b>Yin Yang Yoga For Runners <\/b>class, one can experience tension release, fluid movement, and benefit from improved posture, circulation, injury prevention, as well as increased respiratory control and mental focus...<\/p> <p><b>Each Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with a series of held Yin\/floor postures. While surrendering into the edge of each pose (for 2-5 minutes), students are guided to experience the\u00a0discomforting stagnant energy and its release around the hips, thighs, and lower back, and be connected to the present moment. The Yang flow sequence designed to follow will allow students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for greater circulation and achieve new level of flexibility and energy. \u00a0Guided Relaxation provided at the end will promise to be YUMMY!<\/p> <p>__________________________________________________<\/p> <p><i><b>Testimonies x3: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

The West-Side Greenway begins at Battery Park (the lower tip of Manhattan) and continues north to the George Washington Bridge and beyond. This trip focuses on the sites between Battery Park and the 79th Street Boat basin. <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>DO NOT FORGET TO SCROLL DOWN OF THIS PAGE AND READ HISTORY OF THIS AREA PUBLISHED BY NYC PARKS DEPT.: <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUBWAY ROUTE: <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Take the 2 or 3 Express subway train or Local 1 train to 72 nd St. and walk towards to 75 St. on Broadway.

The fort was later used as an immigration depot (pre-Ellis Island) and now serves as the ticket and information center for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry rides. Take a look as you pass by. Just after Battery Park, you'll have to continue north a short distance on the sidewalk until you eventually reach an entrance to the Battery Park Promenade. From here, you can look out across the Hudson River and see not only New Jersey, but one of America's most beloved landmarks, the Statue of Liberty. Since 1886, \u201cLady Liberty\u201d has stood proudly in New York Harbor, inviting the world to \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d The Statue of Liberty was designed by French master sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, whose original vision was for the statue to mark Egypt's Suez Canal. After history and politics got in the way, Bartholdi looked to the west and decided his statue would be the perfect gift to celebrate America's Centennial. The base of the statue is built over the former Fort Woods and was engineered by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, of Eiffel Tower fame. Just to the north of the statue is Ellis Island, the point of entry for 16 million immigrants between 1892 and 1924. Ferry rides and tours to both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are available from this point of the promenade. Next, find your way back west onto the promenade at Battery Park City, where the real fun begins. Shortly after entering, you will come across a massive courtyard lined with outdoor restaurants. This area surrounds one of NYC\u2019s most prestigious boat docks, where on any given day, you are likely to see some of the most luxurious and expensive private vessels in the world. Take a moment to gaze, then continue your journey north. At the end of the promenade, follow the path to the right, where you will soon connect to the completed portion of the actual greenway. Up until now, your ride will have been completely free of automobile traffic. The West Side Greenway is designed to enable bicyclists and roller bladers to interact safely with automobile traffic entering the various piers along the Hudson River. From here on, be sure to follow all traffic signs and lights on the path and to keep your eyes open at all times. This will help ensure a safe, enjoyable ride, even with children to keep an eye on! As part of the west side revitalization effort, New York City is gradually converting many of its defunct shipping piers into entertainment complexes and tourist attractions. While much of the property along the greenway is still under construction, there are a few attractions that are already booming. The first is a small amusement park complete with kiddie rides, a snack bar, and other fun things to do. Then there are boat rentals, if you dare brave the mighty Hudson. Next, at around 23rd Street, is the mega sports complex at Chelsea Pier, one of downtown Manhattan\u2019s hottest new attractions. Pedestrian traffic gets a little heavier beginning here, so be careful. Continuing north along the path, at 34th Street, look to your right for a clear view of New York City\u2019s most famous fixture - the Empire State Building. Having held the record as the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper for 40 years - the symbol of this city was constructed in only two years - 1930 to 31. Today, as always, this 1,453 foot colossus is one of Manhattan\u2019s premier tourist magnets. Shortly ahead, at Pier 83 on 42nd Street, is the west side location of the Circle Line, one of NY City\u2019s most popular day cruise liners. Also docked here are the various ships belonging to World Yacht Cruises, which provides elegant catered affairs on New York\u2019s waterways. But if you think these are big ships, pedal just a little farther! At 46th Street, you will come across a series of vessels that will make every mega-yacht you\u2019ve seen up to now look miniscule in comparison. First is the USS Intrepid, a Naval carrier built in 1943 which played a major role in the largest naval engagement in history, served as a prime recovery vessel for NASA, and completed three tours of duty during the Vietnam Conflict. The USS Intrepid is a National Historic Landmark which was saved from the scrap yard and restored by Zachary Fisher, who spent $24 million of his own money to turn the carrier into a sea, air, and space museum. Today, the museum draws more than 600,000 visitors annually. By the time you reach the Intrepid, you\u2019ll have walked approximately five easy, flat miles and you\u2019ll have seen enough to talk about for a long time. If you\u2019re up for more, continue at least to West 79th Street and consider having lunch or dinner at the 79th Street Boat Basin Caf\u00e9. You may even want to continue into the 100 streets and cross the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey. It\u2019s all safe and it\u2019s all an excellent way to see New York up close. <\/b><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovpark\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nycgovpark<\/a><\/b><b>...

The fort was later used as an immigration depot (pre-Ellis Island) and now serves as the ticket and information center for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry rides. Take a look as you pass by. Just after Battery Park, you'll have to continue north a short distance on the sidewalk until you eventually reach an entrance to the Battery Park Promenade. From here, you can look out across the Hudson River and see not only New Jersey, but one of America's most beloved landmarks, the Statue of Liberty. Since 1886, \u201cLady Liberty\u201d has stood proudly in New York Harbor, inviting the world to \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d The Statue of Liberty was designed by French master sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, whose original vision was for the statue to mark Egypt's Suez Canal. After history and politics got in the way, Bartholdi looked to the west and decided his statue would be the perfect gift to celebrate America's Centennial. The base of the statue is built over the former Fort Woods and was engineered by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, of Eiffel Tower fame. Just to the north of the statue is Ellis Island, the point of entry for 16 million immigrants between 1892 and 1924. Ferry rides and tours to both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are available from this point of the promenade. Next, find your way back west onto the promenade at Battery Park City, where the real fun begins. Shortly after entering, you will come across a massive courtyard lined with outdoor restaurants. This area surrounds one of NYC\u2019s most prestigious boat docks, where on any given day, you are likely to see some of the most luxurious and expensive private vessels in the world. Take a moment to gaze, then continue your journey north. At the end of the promenade, follow the path to the right, where you will soon connect to the completed portion of the actual greenway. Up until now, your ride will have been completely free of automobile traffic. The West Side Greenway is designed to enable bicyclists and roller bladers to interact safely with automobile traffic entering the various piers along the Hudson River. From here on, be sure to follow all traffic signs and lights on the path and to keep your eyes open at all times. This will help ensure a safe, enjoyable ride, even with children to keep an eye on! As part of the west side revitalization effort, New York City is gradually converting many of its defunct shipping piers into entertainment complexes and tourist attractions. While much of the property along the greenway is still under construction, there are a few attractions that are already booming. The first is a small amusement park complete with kiddie rides, a snack bar, and other fun things to do. Then there are boat rentals, if you dare brave the mighty Hudson. Next, at around 23rd Street, is the mega sports complex at Chelsea Pier, one of downtown Manhattan\u2019s hottest new attractions. Pedestrian traffic gets a little heavier beginning here, so be careful. Continuing north along the path, at 34th Street, look to your right for a clear view of New York City\u2019s most famous fixture - the Empire State Building. Having held the record as the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper for 40 years - the symbol of this city was constructed in only two years - 1930 to 31. Today, as always, this 1,453 foot colossus is one of Manhattan\u2019s premier tourist magnets. Shortly ahead, at Pier 83 on 42nd Street, is the west side location of the Circle Line, one of NY City\u2019s most popular day cruise liners. Also docked here are the various ships belonging to World Yacht Cruises, which provides elegant catered affairs on New York\u2019s waterways. But if you think these are big ships, pedal just a little farther!

The West-Side Greenway begins at Battery Park (the lower tip of Manhattan) and continues north to the George Washington Bridge and beyond. This trip focuses on the sites between Battery Park and the 79th Street Boat basin. <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>DO NOT FORGET TO SCROLL DOWN OF THIS PAGE AND READ HISTORY OF THIS AREA PUBLISHED BY NYC PARKS DEPT.: <\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>SUBWAY ROUTE: <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Take the 2 or 3 Express subway train or Local 1 train to 72 nd St. and walk towards to 75 St. on Broadway.

The fort was later used as an immigration depot (pre-Ellis Island) and now serves as the ticket and information center for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry rides. Take a look as you pass by. Just after Battery Park, you'll have to continue north a short distance on the sidewalk until you eventually reach an entrance to the Battery Park Promenade. From here, you can look out across the Hudson River and see not only New Jersey, but one of America's most beloved landmarks, the Statue of Liberty. Since 1886, \u201cLady Liberty\u201d has stood proudly in New York Harbor, inviting the world to \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d The Statue of Liberty was designed by French master sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, whose original vision was for the statue to mark Egypt's Suez Canal. After history and politics got in the way, Bartholdi looked to the west and decided his statue would be the perfect gift to celebrate America's Centennial. The base of the statue is built over the former Fort Woods and was engineered by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, of Eiffel Tower fame. Just to the north of the statue is Ellis Island, the point of entry for 16 million immigrants between 1892 and 1924. Ferry rides and tours to both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are available from this point of the promenade. Next, find your way back west onto the promenade at Battery Park City, where the real fun begins. Shortly after entering, you will come across a massive courtyard lined with outdoor restaurants. This area surrounds one of NYC\u2019s most prestigious boat docks, where on any given day, you are likely to see some of the most luxurious and expensive private vessels in the world. Take a moment to gaze, then continue your journey north. At the end of the promenade, follow the path to the right, where you will soon connect to the completed portion of the actual greenway. Up until now, your ride will have been completely free of automobile traffic. The West Side Greenway is designed to enable bicyclists and roller bladers to interact safely with automobile traffic entering the various piers along the Hudson River. From here on, be sure to follow all traffic signs and lights on the path and to keep your eyes open at all times. This will help ensure a safe, enjoyable ride, even with children to keep an eye on! As part of the west side revitalization effort, New York City is gradually converting many of its defunct shipping piers into entertainment complexes and tourist attractions. While much of the property along the greenway is still under construction, there are a few attractions that are already booming. The first is a small amusement park complete with kiddie rides, a snack bar, and other fun things to do. Then there are boat rentals, if you dare brave the mighty Hudson. Next, at around 23rd Street, is the mega sports complex at Chelsea Pier, one of downtown Manhattan\u2019s hottest new attractions. Pedestrian traffic gets a little heavier beginning here, so be careful. Continuing north along the path, at 34th Street, look to your right for a clear view of New York City\u2019s most famous fixture - the Empire State Building. Having held the record as the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper for 40 years - the symbol of this city was constructed in only two years - 1930 to 31. Today, as always, this 1,453 foot colossus is one of Manhattan\u2019s premier tourist magnets. Shortly ahead, at Pier 83 on 42nd Street, is the west side location of the Circle Line, one of NY City\u2019s most popular day cruise liners. Also docked here are the various ships belonging to World Yacht Cruises, which provides elegant catered affairs on New York\u2019s waterways. But if you think these are big ships, pedal just a little farther! At 46th Street, you will come across a series of vessels that will make every mega-yacht you\u2019ve seen up to now look miniscule in comparison. First is the USS Intrepid, a Naval carrier built in 1943 which played a major role in the largest naval engagement in history, served as a prime recovery vessel for NASA, and completed three tours of duty during the Vietnam Conflict. The USS Intrepid is a National Historic Landmark which was saved from the scrap yard and restored by Zachary Fisher, who spent $24 million of his own money to turn the carrier into a sea, air, and space museum. Today, the museum draws more than 600,000 visitors annually. By the time you reach the Intrepid, you\u2019ll have walked approximately five easy, flat miles and you\u2019ll have seen enough to talk about for a long time. If you\u2019re up for more, continue at least to West 79th Street and consider having lunch or dinner at the 79th Street Boat Basin Caf\u00e9. You may even want to continue into the 100 streets and cross the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey. It\u2019s all safe and it\u2019s all an excellent way to see New York up close. <\/b><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovpark\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nycgovpark<\/a><\/b><b>...

This year are very excited to present part of the Goldberg Variations for string trio with the wonderful musicians; Ida Kavafian, Steven Tenenbom and Peter Wiley. This will be choreographed by Balanchine ballerina, Deborah Wingert. We are also excited to present Jessica Lee on violin. Not only will she play the Prokofiev duet with her teacher, Ida but we are also playing movements of string quartets by Ravel, Verdi and Dvorak. Peter Wiley, cellist, will play a choreographed piece to the Faure Elegy. Also on the program is the Borodin string trio, choreographed by Elena Comendador. CelloPointe is in rehearsal for this program and I think it will be our best concert yet! Tickets with this code are available online only.

If you can't make it at 4pm, don't worry about missing us. The building is fairly small so we should be able to find each other inside.<\/p> <p>For other details, see Zack's description below:<\/p> <p><b>Gather for a celebration of homemade fermented food &amp; drink!<br\/><\/b><br\/>Fermentation is everywhere and it deserves our love and attention. The goal of Ferment! Ferment! is to encourage home fermentation, and to come together to enjoy and share our experiences making these foods. In a world of fetishization of the food professional, let\u2019s celebrate the amateur fermenter. Think of this as not only a party, but also an informal tasting.<\/p> <p>Do you make something special with your homemade ferments? Maybe you concoct a unique mustard from your own vinegar, or cook up a satisfying soup from your own miso, or perhaps you incorporate home-aged cheese into a delicious dish. How about a funky kraut or fiery kimchi! If so, this is your opportunity to share these types of things.<\/p> <p>The guidelines are simple: bring a homemade fermented food or drink or something made with a homemade ferment to share. If you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s fermented, just drop me a line and ask. Alternatively (or additionally) bring a culture\/starter to swap at the culture exchange table.<\/p> <p>There will also be a few workshops going on throughout the afternoon and evening. We have a bunch of open spots, so if you\u2019ve got skills and you\u2019d like to share, let me know; there are modest stipends available for workshop facilitators.<\/p> <p>RSVPs to Zack at z[dot]schulman[at]gmail[dot]com requested.\u00a0Please share this with anyone who might be interested.<\/p> <p>\n\nSunday, April 10<br\/>4pm to 8pm<\/p> <p>Brooklyn Free School<br\/>372 Clinton Ave (between Greene &amp; Lafayette)<br\/>Brooklyn, NY 11238<\/p> <p>This event is free, but we\u2019ll pass the hat to support our generous hosts.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCFerments\/events\/229187415\/","yes_rsvp_count":62,"duration":14400000,"name":"Ferment!

subregions within it\u2014Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Castilla y Le\u00f3n is the largest of Spain\u2019s 17 administrative regions and covers the northern half of the central Iberian plateau.\u00a0 The region\u2019s agriculture is largely focused on grains, but viticulture has taken place here for a couple of millennia.\u00a0 The climate is very much continental\u2014hot summers, cold winters, sharp daily temperature shifts during the growing season.\u00a0 A coastal mountain range, the Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica, prevents any maritime influence.\u00a0 Rainfall is low, soils are mostly thin and poor, with more clay and mineral around the rivers that flow through the area.\u00a0 And the region\u2019s most prestigious winegrowing districts are in the Duero Valley, near the river that becomes the Douro on the other side of the Portuguese border.\u00a0 This is Tempranillo country, although the grape is known locally as Tinto Fino, Tinto del Pais, or Tinto de Toro.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/5\/8\/600_448425144.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be trying wines from six appellations.<\/p> <p><i>Rueda: <\/i>\u00a0This is one of the few Spanish wine regions that are best known for superior white wines.\u00a0 Sherry-like fortified wines once dominated here, based on the Palomino grape, but in the 1970s, Rioja\u2019s Bodegas Marques de Riscal saw the potential for dry unfortified white wines using the aromatic, fruity varietal Verdejo, which now accounts for 90 percent of production.\u00a0 Cool nights help preserve the wine\u2019s fresh acidity in this otherwise hot region.\u00a0 Much of the Verdejo is unoaked, preserving the wine\u2019s fruit-forward qualities, but some producers are now employing barrel fermentation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying two Rueda Verdejos, one unoaked and made from an almost-extinct Verdejo clone, and a notably oaky barrel-fermented example.\u00a0 It will be interesting to see which production method better complements the grape\u2019s qualities.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Toro:<\/i>\u00a0 Just west of Rueda and 40 miles east of the Portuguese border lies Toro, named after a town of the same name.\u00a0 It seems appropriate that the local wines, powerful reds based on the local Tempranillo strain, Tinta de Toro, call to mind the image of a bull.\u00a0 The hot continental climate means that these grapes achieve high potential alcohol, so local authorities put a 15 percent cap on alcohol content for Toro wines.\u00a0 The prestige of the region has been enhanced by investment by well-known winemakers from outside the area, such as Ribera del Duero\u2019s Vega Sicilia.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Toro made by a former Vega Sicilia winemaker from old-vines ungrafted Tinta de Toro.\u00a0 Judicious use of French oak preserves the wine\u2019s elegance and character.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Tierra del Vino de Zamora:\u00a0 <\/i>West of Toro lies Tierra del Vino de Zamora, a new appellation that acquired DO status in 2008.\u00a0 It shares the climatic characteristics of Toro, but grows a greater variety of grapes\u2014Malvasia, Godello, Verdejo, Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Cabernet Sauvignon, among others.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Tempranillo still dominates.\u00a0 The most prestigious maker in the region is Bodega Vi\u00f1as del Cenit, and we will be trying their 2009 Via Cenit, made organically with old-vines Tempranillo (some over 100 years old), and matured in French oak.<\/p> <p><i>Cigales:<\/i> East of Toro lies Cigales, another relatively new appellation that lies at a higher altitude than its western neighbor.\u00a0 This is a relatively undeveloped region, which has the advantage of preserving traditional viticultural methods and old vines.\u00a0 Tempranillo (aka Tinta del Pais) dominates.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a wine made by Rioja\u2019s Baron de Ley at their Cigales winery, Finca Museum, where their goal is to make high-quality, value-priced wines from old-vines Tempranillo.<\/p> <p><i>Ribera del Duero:<\/i>\u00a0 This is the most important and prestigious region within Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\u00a0 A relatively young DO (established in 1982), it now rivals Rioja as the most prestigious producer of Spanish red wines.\u00a0 As the name suggests, the region straddles the Duero River, which provides a much-needed water supply and a limestone, chalk, and clay topsoil that adds complexity to the wines.\u00a0 The star producer of the region is Vega Sicilia, whose flagship Unico wine is like the Spanish equivalent of a Bordeaux first growth.\u00a0 Tempranillo must make up at least 75 percent of Ribera del Duero wine, with Bordeaux varietals usually used for blending.\u00a0 Our Ribera del Duero comes from Hacienda Monasterio, where the resident winemaker is Danish enologist Peter Sisseck, who founded Pingus, another benchmark wine for the region.\u00a0 Hacienda Monasterio represents unusual value for top-quality Ribera del Duero.<\/p> <p><i>Sardon del Duero:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a contiguous region to the west of Ribera del Duero that shares the same geographic and climatic conditions.\u00a0 The biggest name in the region is Abadia Retuerta, an ultramodern winery that maintains high quality standards for its Tempranillo wines despite large-volume production.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying their 2009 Selecci\u00f3n Especial.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be meeting at Morton's Steakhouse in White Plains, which is BYOB on Sunday.\u00a0 The reservationist was unaware of this policy\u2014we might be the first to take advantage of it!\u00a0 The Tempranillos should make a great match with a good steak.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mortons.com\/whiteplains\/#_=_\"><a

<p><i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 Produced with an old Verdejo clone called \u201cmalcorta,\u201d the 2014 V Malcorta has some tropical aromas of pineapple intermixed with more serious aromas of hay and straw, over a core of white fruit. The palate is intense with a combination of pineapple and leesy flavors, as it was matured in contact with the lees with <i>b\u00e2ttonage<\/i> for some four months before bottling.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Naia Naiades (Rueda)\u00a0 $26<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16\/20<\/i> \u2013 Creamy, rich, super-smooth. Good persistence and fruit purity, though quite reliant on caramel oak for complexity.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Bodegas y Vi\u00f1edos Maurodos San Roman (Toro) \u00a0$30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 San Roman, is year in, year out, one of the most reliable wines of the appellation, pure Tempranillo (locally known as Tinta de Toro), the fruit from over 35-year-old, ungrafted and head-pruned vineyards planted on sandy, stony soils rich in clay in different villages across the Toro appellation. The wine aged for two years in French and American oak barrels, 80% of which were new. It\u2019s an earthy wine with plenty of dark aromas of peat, fountain pen ink, graphite, and tar, with very ripe fruit, black and blue berries. The palate is quite full-bodied, with abundant but fine tannins and enough acidity and persistence. A Toro with character.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 93<\/i> \u2013 Black plum, coffee, and mineral notes show depth and richness in this plush, firm red, with plenty of structure. Balanced and harmonious, ending with an alluring floral finish.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Vi\u00f1as del Cenit Via Cenit (Tierra del Vino de Zamora)\u00a0 $30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 100% Tempranillo.\u00a0 The 2009 Via Cenit spent 12 months in French oak. It is purple\/black in color with an impressive aromatic display of <i>pain grill\u00e9,<\/i> pencil lead, violets, incense, and blackberry. Full-bodied, structured, dense, and mouth-filling, it has the stuffing to evolve for 3-4 years and will provide pleasure through 2024 if not longer. Savory, ripe, and lengthy, it admirably reflects the superb conditions presented by the 2009 vintage.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Bodegas Museum Vinea Tempranillo Crianza (Cigales)\u00a0 $16<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 88<\/i> \u2013 The 2010 Vinea Tempranillo Crianza sees 15 months in oak barrel (60% American and 40% French) and is bottled unfiltered. It offers a generous, clean, sumptuous bouquet of dark plum, blueberry, mulberry, and mocha that displays good intensity. The palate is medium bodied with a soft, rounded entry. There is decent weight here for a Crianza, but it never tries to be overly ambitious. Rather, it aims for the \u201cdrinkability jugular\u201d with its soft, caressing tannins and rich dark plum and mocha-tinged finish. This is well-crafted and epitomizes the kind of Spanish wine that gets finished to the bottom of the bottle.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Abadia Retuerta Selecci\u00f3n Especial (Sard\u00f3n del Duero)\u00a0 $32<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 In terms of value for money, I would head straight to the 2009 Seleccion Especial, a blend of 75% Tempranillo, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah. It has a rounded, iodine-tinged bouquet with great purity and panache, the oak seamlessly integrated with scents of black coffee developing over time. The palate is medium-bodied with a fleshy texture, crisp acidity and very fine tannins. It has a velvety, caressing texture with blackberry, cassis and espresso towards the precise, supple finish. This is an accomplished, flavor-packed wine that should repay a few month\u2019s cellaring. Drink now 2013-2018.<\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 90<\/i> \u2013 (75% tempranillo, 15% cabernet sauvignon and 10% syrah, aged for 18 months in French and American oak):\u00a0 Deep ruby.\u00a0 Aromas and flavors of cherry compote, vanilla, mocha and tar, with smoke and floral overtones.\u00a0 Lush and open-knit, finishing with punch and pliant tannins.\u00a0 This wine is approachable now, with a little air. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2010 Hacienda Monasterio Reserva (Ribera del Duero)\u00a0 $64<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 95<\/i> \u2013 The 2010 Reserva contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon from selected plots from their slope vineyards planted 25 years ago on chalk-rich soils that fermented with indigenous yeasts. 2010 was a near-perfect growing season, producing wines that are both powerful and fresh and that should have a long life in bottle. The nose is fragrant and elegant, mixing notes of red and black fruit with a sense of extreme harmony. Very showy. As much as it\u2019s elegant it also feels powerful and serious, quite Ribera, with good typicity. The palate is medium to full-bodied, with polished tannins, and is supple and tasty and with great acidity and length. A balanced, elegant vintage, not showy or voluptuous, but more serious and developing complexity. A fine and elegant Ribera. Bravo! At this quality level this represents very good value.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group\/events\/230046104\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Castilla y Le\u00f3n","id":"230046104","time":1460325600000,"updated":1460344213000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403902580000,"name":"Westchester BYOB Wine Tasting Group","group_lon":-73.8600006104,"id":15362102,"urlname":"Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group","group_lat":41.0800018311,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Garden City","address_1":"45 7th St","name":"Polo Steakhouse","lon":-73.640244,"id":23714668,"lat":40.723919,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":18.4366168976,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454808517000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Polo Steakhouse the hidden gem located inside the legendary Garden City Hotel features, a classic American Steakhouse menu.
