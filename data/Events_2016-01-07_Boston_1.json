All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Standardization of each step of the process in tissue, slide and image preparation and deliver within an institution, between institutions, as well as between vendors are important. The goal of the standardization in Digital Pathology is to obtain the most accurate and reliable image data as best as possible with the system we have. Then the WSIs can be effectively used for its purpose, such for diagnosis, image analysis, and so on. However the required quality for different situation is not the same. Since there are various equipment available, each with its own specifications and price tags, we need to have our own standard definition of what quality means to reach the goal. Our standard definition of quality can be decided through the evaluation of these 6 major criteria: slide quality, image quality, stain, color, human interface, and network. In this talk, topics related to image quality and color will be focused on.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLocation\/Parking: the Microsoft NERD center is a short walk from the Kendall Sq.

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/227322829\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"The Tuesday Track Workout","id":"bdcdmlytqbtb","time":1450222200000,"updated":1450234065000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"438 Somerville Avenue","name":"Cambridge Hackspace @ P.irateship","lon":-71.10244,"id":24079947,"state":"MA","lat":42.381321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.22099041939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447293564000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's Christmas, so lets make tonight's meeting Christmas themed.<\/p> <p>It's a great time to see the new space if you haven't already, and see what we're up to.<\/p> <p>Bring food, drink, and your usual projects!<\/p> <p>---------------------<\/p> <p>Spend some time on your project by bringing it along to our weekly project night, an evening designed around you and what you're working on.<\/p> <p>This weekly event is about finding time to tinker, being creative, and meeting other members of the community.

In 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer\u2014the most notorious serial killer since Jack the Ripper\u2014seared himself into the American consciousness. To the public, Dahmer was a monster who committed unthinkable atrocities. To Derf Backderf, \"Jeff\" was a much more complex figure: a high school friend with whom he had shared classrooms, hallways, and car rides. In My Friend Dahmer, a haunting and original graphic novel, writer-artist Backderf creates a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of a disturbed young man struggling against the morbid urges emanating from the deep recesses of his psyche\u2014a shy kid, a teenage alcoholic, and a goofball who never quite fit in with his classmates. With profound insight, what emerges is a Jeffrey Dahmer that few ever really knew, and one readers will never forget.<\/p> <p><b>If you plan on coming,<\/b> once you've read the book please post one discussion question in the comments for this event.

A powerful singer and sophisticated songwriter, Susan has seen the darkness in the corners and sings about it fearlessly. Following in the footsteps of Matraca Berg, Kim Richey, Lucinda Williams and Gretchen Peters, the well-respected Boston artist combines vivid storytelling with a modern songwriter's spin. Call it New England Americana with a twang. Respectful of tradition, but not bound by it, Susan blends rock, folk and blues with a healthy dose of country.<\/p> <p>Her fourth and latest album, Haunted Heart, was produced by Lorne Entress and released to critical acclaim. Songs from the record have earned Susan a spot in the finals at Kerrville's New Folk Contest. Susan was also a regional finalist at the Mountain Stage New Song Contest, a finalist in the USA Songwriting Competition, the Independent Music Awards and the International Acoustic Music Awards. The record was named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Year by the Alternate Root and won 2015 Album of the Year at Limelight Music Awards.<\/p> <p>VANCE GILBERT<br\/>Vance Gilbert burst onto the singer\/songwriter scene in the early 90's when buzz started spreading in the folk clubs of Boston about an ex-multicultural arts teacher who was knocking 'em dead at open mics. Born and raised in the Philadelphia area, Vance started out hoping to be a jazz singer, and then discovered his affinity for the storytelling sensibilities of acoustic folk music. Once word got out about Gilbert's stage-owning singing and playing, Shawn Colvin invited him to be special guest on her Fat City tour. Noted not only for being the ever consummate performer, Gilbert has recorded 12 albums, including 4 for Philo\/Rounder Records and a duo album with friend Ellis Paul. Along with being opener of choice for artists as varied as Aretha Franklin, Arlo Guthrie, and Anita Baker, 2006 and 2007 found Gilbert opening 140+ shows for comedian George Carlin. Most recently he's the opener of choice for Paul Reiser and the Subdudes.<\/p> <p>Considered by many to be an integral part of the national folk scene, Gilbert's approach to the acoustic singer songwriter idiom is significant. Gilbert's compositions, while frequently employing sophisticated melodies and harmonies that attest to his jazz roots, remain sublime attestations to the storyteller's craft.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonLiveMusic\/events\/227352697\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Susan Cattaneo Residency with Vance Gilbert at the Lizard Lounge","id":"227352697","time":1450229400000,"updated":1450241349000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1173143620000,"name":"Boston Live Music","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":444171,"urlname":"BostonLiveMusic","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Fans of Live Music"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Danvers","address_1":"150R ANDOVER St","name":"Danvers Indoor Sports","lon":-70.971596,"id":23829904,"lat":42.558483,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":14.632109642,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1448386482000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please be at Danvers Indoor Sports around 8:45 PM so we can start playing exactly at 9 PM.<\/p> <p>Bring White and Dark T-shirts so we can be divided evenly into two teams.<\/p> <p>Cost of Each Player Per a Game is equal to the dollar amount of rental divided by the number of players who will attend the game.<\/p> <p>Very Important:<\/p> <p>this is a non-profit event.<\/p> <p>See You in the Field \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Danvers-Real-Indoor-Soccer\/events\/226993538\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":4500000,"name":"Danvers Real Indoor Soccer","id":"vdrlmlytqbtb","time":1450230300000,"updated":1450236178000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1445469287000,"name":"Danvers, Real Indoor Soccer","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":19049459,"urlname":"Danvers-Real-Indoor-Soccer","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"soccer players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Mansfield","address_1":"31 Oxford Rd","name":"Mansfield Sports Plex","lon":-71.243431,"id":18807962,"state":"MA","lat":42.03141,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":24.4271087646,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450124772000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be playing indoors at the Mansfield Sports Plex (31 Oxford Rd, Mansfield, MA). \u00a0They have both courts and a turf field. \u00a0We can use cleats, sneakers, or indoor soccer shoes on the turf field, but only sneakers\/indoor soccer shoes on the courts. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Come prepared to play on either surface because if we get too many for the turf, we'll have to split into two games (one on turf and the other on the courts).<\/p> <p><b>Cost should be about $10 per person.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Also bring both a white and dark shirt to help split into teams.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We are joining another group of players, so there should be enough to play even if there aren't many RSVPs.<\/b><\/p> <p>Thanks,<\/p> <p>-Dave<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorwoodPickUp\/events\/227419911\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Indoor Soccer \/ Futsal - Game On","id":"227419911","time":1450231200000,"updated":1450237568000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1405221118000,"name":"Norfolk County Pick-up Soccer","group_lon":-71.2200012207,"id":15673122,"urlname":"NorwoodPickUp","group_lat":42.0200004578,"who":"Athletes"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"480 Massachusetts Avenue","name":"The Middle East Corner","lon":-71.101074,"id":23928848,"state":"MA","lat":42.363781,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.61124134064,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450039886000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Week Anderson Comedy welcomes comedians of all levels of experience to take the Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub Corner Bar super tall stage!

Set times start at 4 minutes each, though if the list gets too crowded they can sometimes be cut down.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1652899298285058\/1663901673851487\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1652899298285058\/1663901673851487\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Comedy-shows-for-free-or-cheap\/events\/227400031\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":14400000,"name":"#mideastcorn \"Greater Boston's Most NightMarish Comedy Open Mic\"","id":"227400031","time":1450231200000,"updated":1450246471000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1285724355000,"name":"Boston-area Comedy Lovers - Comedy shows for free (or cheap)","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1714373,"urlname":"Comedy-shows-for-free-or-cheap","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"comedy lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02131","country":"us","city":"Jamaica Plain","address_1":"90 South St.","name":"Farnsworth House","lon":-71.114868,"id":16317552,"state":"MA","lat":42.306316,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.36920404434,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449684748000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Easy Parking: If you plan on driving, please note that there is much unregulated parking on Centre Street. \u00a0We have also secured 20 parking spaces behind the St. Thomas Aquinas church.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Business-Network-International-Jamaica-Plain\/events\/227319604\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"JP Business Networking Group","id":"pzqtmlytqbvb","time":1450267200000,"updated":1450273462000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449683954000,"name":"JP Business Networking Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":19197738,"urlname":"BNI-Business-Network-International-Jamaica-Plain","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","city":"Lowell","address_1":"300 Martin Luther King Jr Way","name":"Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell","lon":-71.313225,"id":13331082,"state":"MA","lat":42.649769,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5923786163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1392657020000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Proceed to the second level of the Tsongas Arena and head left across the concourse toward the Talon Club.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Betrayal, treachery, the loss of innocence and the scars of love, pave the road in this intense emotional and human comedy about becoming a true boss of family and enterprise facing a world of unforgiving commerce. Allies become adversaries and adversaries become allies, both inside and outside the family, as Joy's inner life and fierce imagination carry her through the storm she faces. Jennifer Lawrence stars, with Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Edgar Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen, Elisabeth R\u00f6hm and Dascha Polanco. Like David O.

We believe that we will be able to successfully manipulate this consideration in the meetup system to keep the meetings all on the Thursday evening before expiration Friday.

Come meet a potential partner for a relationship tonight. Socialize and mingle at the bar. We are a network of women here for many different reasons, such as marketing our small business to meet potential clients, networking for a larger organization if you are in sales for that company, empowerment, socializing, traveling, educating each other, for meeting likeminded women friends, and I have since realized that we have attracted many lesbian members who might be interested in meeting other women for a relationship. I thought I would add a night for those of you who might be interested to meet other women. If this is something of interest to you and you would like it to be known that you are \"in the market\" :), RSVP yes (even if you can't come!) and post a little hello in the comments.

We expect the gift swap to take about 30 minutes and to be done before 9:00. \u00a0However, it may take longer if it is very large, and there is no absolute guarantee of when it will start and finish. \u00a0Please be forewarned of that if you have to leave by a certain time.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThanks for reading! \u00a0It's going to be a truly awesome evening. \u00a0If you're looking for general info about our group, it's all below.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n----<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/8\/600_436680296.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We are a casual group of people who enjoy playing\u00a0<b>complex\u00a0<\/b>board games -- the kind of board games that\u00a0<b>make you think.<\/b>\u00a0We play a variety of games, most of which are\u00a0<b>Euro\u00a0<\/b>style games of medium complexity. \u00a0Games often last 90 minutes or more and involve juggling a lot of rules and factors in your head, to decide what to do. \u00a0However, there's also plenty of laughter and friendship involved. \u00a0If that sounds up your alley, we hope you'll join us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our weekly meetup is in a\u00a0<b>TERRIFIC space for games<\/b> steps from the Kendall Square T, with easy parking, and lots of room to spread out in. \u00a0Full directions are below. \u00a0The building door does get locked in the evening, but there is plenty of foot traffic in and out. \u00a0If you expect to arrive later than 8:30, send Tucker a message earlier in the day, and we'll make sure someone is there to let you in.<\/p> <p>Our meetups happen once a week (alternating Mondays and Wednesdays), from 7:00 pm onwards. \u00a0Our group has been running since 2007, and we have a large crowd of regulars as well as new members each week.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>BEANTOWN GAMERS RSVP POLICY:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>1.

If you would like to come but there are no spots, consider attending our alternative \"Light Game Night\" a few steps away at Cosi Cafe. \u00a0You can also sign up as \"wants a spot\" and receive emails from meetup if a spot opens up. \u00a0Finally, if there are unusual circumstances, you can send Tucker a message. \u00a0(NOTE: DOES NOT APPLY FOR THIS DATE ONLY.)<\/p> <p>5. We know everyone has emergencies. \u00a0But consistent, inconsiderate use of RSVPs -- which includes being a \"no show\", cancelling in the last 24 hours, or frequently cancelling RSVPs -- will lead to being removed from the group. \u00a0Sorry, we still like you, it's just not fair to everyone else!<\/p> <p>6.

We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The strategy for cashing out needs to be easy enough to make it worth your while and safe enough to stay out of the klink. With more and more focus on identifying and stopping credit card fraud cybercrooks are diversifying their methods for cashing out. While criminals can, and do, sell whole and bundled online retailer accounts, credit card data, and fullz, I want to look at how they get their grubby paws on that cold hard cash. Lets dig into the tools, techniques, and procedures used by this new generation of e-launderers and cyber hustlers.<\/p> <p>Understanding the lifecycle of a financially motivated cybercrime is an important part of successfully and efficiently defending against them. When we have insight into the tools, techniques, procedures, motivations, methods, and ecosystems driving these attacks we are afforded the opportunity to build defense in depth that specifically targets the weaknesses and load-bearing assumptions of the attackers.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/3\/600_444347443.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>About Benjamin Brown:<\/i><\/p> <p>Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies.

Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.<\/p> <p><b>By Bus<\/b><\/p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square. \u00a0The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center.\u00a0The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway.\u00a0The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square.\u00a0From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard.

You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.<\/p> <p><b>By Car<\/b><\/p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

Behind the venue, there is a small parking garage with unlimited parking for us. The venue offers sandwiches and drinks, so you won\u2019t have to go hungry.<\/p> <p>TICKETS:<\/p> <p>Please sign up in advance to get the $10 price. Walk-ins will be allowed as long as the ratio of men to women is right but will pay $20 each per event (or $30 for two events.) Why do walk-ins pay more? Because they make a lot more work for me! So sign up in advance and get the darn-cheap $10 price.<\/p> <p>Lastly, please note that tickets stop selling at 2:00 pm on the day of the events. If you don't get a ticket online, you can try your luck as a walk-in...<\/p> <p>REFUNDS:<\/p> <p>The official policy is no refunds, unless an event gets cancelled. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>GUARANTEE:<\/p> <p>I would love to guarantee that you'll meet a minimum number of people, and I do my best to keep the numbers balanced, but at the end of the day, it's really tough. I can only guarantee that there will be at least three people of each sex registered before an event happens, otherwise it will get cancelled before event day. But there are things outside my controI, like no-shows and people who get the wrong ticket and then want to change once they've arrived. And did I mention no-shows? :)<\/p> <p>WHY REGISTER IN ADVANCE:<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you are guaranteed admission, you pay less, and you are much more likely to connect with your mutual matches. When you register online, all your contact info (name, email, cell) is in the system and ready to be used to match you up. When you show up as a walk-in, you have to hand-write all your info, and if I can't read it, I can't match you up.<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you're guaranteed to get in. Once the events sell out, there are no guarantees. It would be a shame to get there only to get turned away. We'll always try to accommodate people who show up, but there are no guarantees of admission.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>(0) You canceled\/refunded my ticket!!! Why???<\/p> <p>For these events on Dec 18th, the previous venue canceled with only 48 hours notice. I was able to find another venue, but it is much smaller and cannot hold all the people that would have easily fit into the old venue. So the number of participants must be pared down so that we can fit into the venue! Next time, if we go back to this same new venue, I will restructure all the events so that we can all fit!<\/p> <p>(1) Do I need to print and bring my ticket on event day?<\/p> <p>Nope. There will be a guest list and preprinted dating scorecards for the participants who have preregistered. You won't need your emailed ticket. But you SHOULD bring something to write with!<\/p> <p>(2) I RSVP'ed on Meetup. Am I registered for this event?<\/p> <p>Nope! Meetup RSVP's mean nothing. You need to get tickets on Eventbrite to be registered.<\/p> <p>(3) When should I register for these events?<\/p> <p>Sooner is better than later, but definitely don't wait till the last minute, as events do sell out. You should absolutely sign up NO LATER THAN TWO DAYS before the events. Why? Because if there aren't enough people registered the day before event day, I'll be cancelling the smaller events. If I cancel after you've signed up, you get refunded. But once I cancel, the event is gone. If you had signed up earlier, the event might have happened. Capisce?<\/p> <p>(4) Do you offer refunds?<\/p> <p>Nope. The official policy is no refunds, especially on or after event day. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>(5) I only see five people signed up for this event. Are you still going to hold it?<\/p> <p>Yes.\u00a0 You are looking at one Meetup group. This event is posted in multiple Meetup groups (usually 20 or so), as well as other external sites. There will be many people there!<\/p> <p>(6) I didn't receive my matches within 48 hours like you promised! What should I do???<\/p> <p>First, check your SPAM\/junk mail folder. If you don't find your matches, send me a message via Meetup or via text message, not via regular email. If you attended, I sent you your matches via regular email. If you didn't get them the first time, then you probably won't get them no matter how many times I resend them via email. So try Meetup messaging or texting, and I'll reply with your matches there.<\/p> <p>(7) It's been fifteen minutes since the event ended and I haven't received my matches yet!!! What should I do???<\/p> <p>Wait another 47 hours and 45 minutes. Then see the previous question.<\/p> <p>OR get one of the EXPEDITED MATCHES tickets and receive your matches much sooner!<\/p> <p>(8) How many people are signed up for the XYZ event?<\/p> <p>Sorry, but if I answer every person who asks that question, I will waste a lot of time doing so. In general, there tend to be more women than men signed up, but that is not always the case. And of course the numbers are changing constantly as people register!<\/p> <p>(9) Will there be an even number of men and women? I don't want to attend otherwise.<\/p> <p>Then you should not attend. There's never a perfect balance between men and women. First off, women are much more willing to sign up than men. Then, there are no-shows, and people who sign up for the wrong event. In short, it's impossible to have a perfect balance unless I've got 5 extra men and women for each individual event ready to hop in if needed. Of course, that's where having many volunteers helps a lot.<\/p> <p>(10) Why did you do away with the free BUDDY offer?<\/p> <p>I had implemented the BUDDY system as a way to keep balance between men and women, but not enough people were using it, and often those that did use it made mistakes while registering which made it even HARDER to keep the balance between men and women. So it's gone. Now, everyone registers himself, and that's it.<\/p> <p>(11) If I am attending only one event but decide while I'm there to attend a second, do I have to pay the walk-in rate?<\/p> <p>No. If you've already signed up for one event, you're in the system, so you'll just pay the extra $10 for the second event. It's people that aren't preregistered and aren't in the system that pay the walk-in rate.<\/p> <p>(12) I didn't like anyone at the event. Should I still turn in my datecard?<\/p> <p>YES! Missing datecards slow down the matching process. When I'm making the matches, I notice when someone has not turned in his card, and I'll send a message asking about it. So save us both some time and turn in your datecard. It's better if you turn in your card, so that I know that we have your card and that it was not lost or overlooked.<\/p> <p>(13) I forgot to turn in my datecard. What do I do???<\/p> <p>Scan in or take a picture of your datecard and send it to me via email, or send me a Meetup message with the list of people you chose, and I'll make your matches! But please do it ASAP, so I can finish within the 48-hour promised time window.<\/p> <p>(14) If I ask a question which you answer in this post, will you answer my email anyway?<\/p> <p>Heh heh heh.... Don't hold your breath! If you couldn't take the time to read the FAQ, why should I take the time to reply to your message?<\/p> <p>Any other questions? Just ask... after you've read the FAQ, of course!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Potbelly is on the first floor.

To qualify, you must:<\/p> <p>(1) get a paid ticket via Eventbrite (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bargaindating.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.BargainDating.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.BargainDating.com<\/a><\/a>), and<\/p> <p>(2) attend and turn in your completed scorecard.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Winners will be notified by me personally. :)<\/p> <p>=======================================<\/p> <p>BargainDating runs Boston's first affordable speed dating events. We're now in Porter Sq, at a sandwich shop, complete with a free parking garage, right next to the Red Line!<\/p> <p>Each BargainDate round will last between 4 and 10 minutes, depending on the number of participants. Each overall event will take less than an hour, so be prepared to meet new people in a short time! You'll fill out a form and pass it in at the end of the event. Then you'll receive an email with all your mutual matches within 48 hours!<\/p> <p>There will be different time slots and tables for different age ranges. Make sure you get the proper ticket!<\/p> <p>Okay, so what are the age ranges? They're as follows:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 6:30 - 7:30 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 **** CANCELED **** (1A) Ages 21 - 28 **** CANCELED ***<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1B) Ages 26 - 35<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1C) Ages 33 - 44<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1D) Ages 42 - 55<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 8:00 - 9:00 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2A) Ages 24 - 32<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2B) Ages 30 - 40<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2C) Ages 38 - 50<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2D) Ages 48 - 63<\/p> <p>VENUE:<\/p> <p>The Potbelly Sandwich Shop (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True<\/a><\/a>) is located in the Porter Square Galleria, right next to the Porter Square Red Line station. Behind the venue, there is a small parking garage with unlimited parking for us. The venue offers sandwiches and drinks, so you won\u2019t have to go hungry.<\/p> <p>TICKETS:<\/p> <p>Please sign up in advance to get the $10 price. Walk-ins will be allowed as long as the ratio of men to women is right but will pay $20 each per event (or $30 for two events.) Why do walk-ins pay more? Because they make a lot more work for me! So sign up in advance and get the darn-cheap $10 price.<\/p> <p>Lastly, please note that tickets stop selling at 2:00 pm on the day of the events. If you don't get a ticket online, you can try your luck as a walk-in...<\/p> <p>REFUNDS:<\/p> <p>The official policy is no refunds, unless an event gets cancelled. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>GUARANTEE:<\/p> <p>I would love to guarantee that you'll meet a minimum number of people, and I do my best to keep the numbers balanced, but at the end of the day, it's really tough. I can only guarantee that there will be at least three people of each sex registered before an event happens, otherwise it will get cancelled before event day. But there are things outside my controI, like no-shows and people who get the wrong ticket and then want to change once they've arrived. And did I mention no-shows? :)<\/p> <p>WHY REGISTER IN ADVANCE:<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you are guaranteed admission, you pay less, and you are much more likely to connect with your mutual matches. When you register online, all your contact info (name, email, cell) is in the system and ready to be used to match you up. When you show up as a walk-in, you have to hand-write all your info, and if I can't read it, I can't match you up.<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you're guaranteed to get in. Once the events sell out, there are no guarantees. It would be a shame to get there only to get turned away. We'll always try to accommodate people who show up, but there are no guarantees of admission.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>(0) You canceled\/refunded my ticket!!! Why???<\/p> <p>For these events on Dec 18th, the previous venue canceled with only 48 hours notice. I was able to find another venue, but it is much smaller and cannot hold all the people that would have easily fit into the old venue. So the number of participants must be pared down so that we can fit into the venue! Next time, if we go back to this same new venue, I will restructure all the events so that we can all fit!<\/p> <p>(1) Do I need to print and bring my ticket on event day?<\/p> <p>Nope. There will be a guest list and preprinted dating scorecards for the participants who have preregistered. You won't need your emailed ticket. But you SHOULD bring something to write with!<\/p> <p>(2) I RSVP'ed on Meetup. Am I registered for this event?<\/p> <p>Nope! Meetup RSVP's mean nothing. You need to get tickets on Eventbrite to be registered.<\/p> <p>(3) When should I register for these events?<\/p> <p>Sooner is better than later, but definitely don't wait till the last minute, as events do sell out. You should absolutely sign up NO LATER THAN TWO DAYS before the events. Why? Because if there aren't enough people registered the day before event day, I'll be cancelling the smaller events. If I cancel after you've signed up, you get refunded. But once I cancel, the event is gone. If you had signed up earlier, the event might have happened. Capisce?<\/p> <p>(4) Do you offer refunds?<\/p> <p>Nope. The official policy is no refunds, especially on or after event day. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>(5) I only see five people signed up for this event. Are you still going to hold it?<\/p> <p>Yes.\u00a0 You are looking at one Meetup group. This event is posted in multiple Meetup groups (usually 20 or so), as well as other external sites. There will be many people there!<\/p> <p>(6) I didn't receive my matches within 48 hours like you promised! What should I do???<\/p> <p>First, check your SPAM\/junk mail folder. If you don't find your matches, send me a message via Meetup or via text message, not via regular email. If you attended, I sent you your matches via regular email. If you didn't get them the first time, then you probably won't get them no matter how many times I resend them via email. So try Meetup messaging or texting, and I'll reply with your matches there.<\/p> <p>(7) It's been fifteen minutes since the event ended and I haven't received my matches yet!!! What should I do???<\/p> <p>Wait another 47 hours and 45 minutes. Then see the previous question.<\/p> <p>OR get one of the EXPEDITED MATCHES tickets and receive your matches much sooner!<\/p> <p>(8) How many people are signed up for the XYZ event?<\/p> <p>Sorry, but if I answer every person who asks that question, I will waste a lot of time doing so. In general, there tend to be more women than men signed up, but that is not always the case. And of course the numbers are changing constantly as people register!<\/p> <p>(9) Will there be an even number of men and women? I don't want to attend otherwise.<\/p> <p>Then you should not attend. There's never a perfect balance between men and women. First off, women are much more willing to sign up than men. Then, there are no-shows, and people who sign up for the wrong event. In short, it's impossible to have a perfect balance unless I've got 5 extra men and women for each individual event ready to hop in if needed. Of course, that's where having many volunteers helps a lot.<\/p> <p>(10) Why did you do away with the free BUDDY offer?<\/p> <p>I had implemented the BUDDY system as a way to keep balance between men and women, but not enough people were using it, and often those that did use it made mistakes while registering which made it even HARDER to keep the balance between men and women. So it's gone. Now, everyone registers himself, and that's it.<\/p> <p>(11) If I am attending only one event but decide while I'm there to attend a second, do I have to pay the walk-in rate?<\/p> <p>No. If you've already signed up for one event, you're in the system, so you'll just pay the extra $10 for the second event. It's people that aren't preregistered and aren't in the system that pay the walk-in rate.<\/p> <p>(12) I didn't like anyone at the event. Should I still turn in my datecard?<\/p> <p>YES! Missing datecards slow down the matching process. When I'm making the matches, I notice when someone has not turned in his card, and I'll send a message asking about it. So save us both some time and turn in your datecard. It's better if you turn in your card, so that I know that we have your card and that it was not lost or overlooked.<\/p> <p>(13) I forgot to turn in my datecard. What do I do???<\/p> <p>Scan in or take a picture of your datecard and send it to me via email, or send me a Meetup message with the list of people you chose, and I'll make your matches! But please do it ASAP, so I can finish within the 48-hour promised time window.<\/p> <p>(14) If I ask a question which you answer in this post, will you answer my email anyway?<\/p> <p>Heh heh heh.... Don't hold your breath! If you couldn't take the time to read the FAQ, why should I take the time to reply to your message?<\/p> <p>Any other questions? Just ask... after you've read the FAQ, of course!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/chill-lax\/events\/227034576\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":11700000,"name":"BargainDating'\u00ad\u00ads Last Speed Dating Events in 2015.

We're now in Porter Sq, at a sandwich shop, complete with a free parking garage, right next to the Red Line!<\/p> <p>Each BargainDate round will last between 4 and 10 minutes, depending on the number of participants. Each overall event will take less than an hour, so be prepared to meet new people in a short time! You'll fill out a form and pass it in at the end of the event. Then you'll receive an email with all your mutual matches within 48 hours!<\/p> <p>There will be different time slots and tables for different age ranges. Make sure you get the proper ticket!<\/p> <p>Okay, so what are the age ranges? They're as follows:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 6:30 - 7:30 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 **** CANCELED **** (1A) Ages 21 - 28 **** CANCELED ***<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1B) Ages 26 - 35<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1C) Ages 33 - 44<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1D) Ages 42 - 55<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 8:00 - 9:00 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2A) Ages 24 - 32<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2B) Ages 30 - 40<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2C) Ages 38 - 50<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2D) Ages 48 - 63<\/p> <p>VENUE:<\/p> <p>The Potbelly Sandwich Shop (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True<\/a><\/a>) is located in the Porter Square Galleria, right next to the Porter Square Red Line station. Behind the venue, there is a small parking garage with unlimited parking for us. The venue offers sandwiches and drinks, so you won\u2019t have to go hungry.<\/p> <p>TICKETS:<\/p> <p>Please sign up in advance to get the $10 price. Walk-ins will be allowed as long as the ratio of men to women is right but will pay $20 each per event (or $30 for two events.) Why do walk-ins pay more? Because they make a lot more work for me! So sign up in advance and get the darn-cheap $10 price.<\/p> <p>Lastly, please note that tickets stop selling at 2:00 pm on the day of the events. If you don't get a ticket online, you can try your luck as a walk-in...<\/p> <p>REFUNDS:<\/p> <p>The official policy is no refunds, unless an event gets cancelled. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>GUARANTEE:<\/p> <p>I would love to guarantee that you'll meet a minimum number of people, and I do my best to keep the numbers balanced, but at the end of the day, it's really tough. I can only guarantee that there will be at least three people of each sex registered before an event happens, otherwise it will get cancelled before event day. But there are things outside my controI, like no-shows and people who get the wrong ticket and then want to change once they've arrived. And did I mention no-shows? :)<\/p> <p>WHY REGISTER IN ADVANCE:<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you are guaranteed admission, you pay less, and you are much more likely to connect with your mutual matches. When you register online, all your contact info (name, email, cell) is in the system and ready to be used to match you up. When you show up as a walk-in, you have to hand-write all your info, and if I can't read it, I can't match you up.<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you're guaranteed to get in. Once the events sell out, there are no guarantees. It would be a shame to get there only to get turned away. We'll always try to accommodate people who show up, but there are no guarantees of admission.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>(0) You canceled\/refunded my ticket!!! Why???<\/p> <p>For these events on Dec 18th, the previous venue canceled with only 48 hours notice. I was able to find another venue, but it is much smaller and cannot hold all the people that would have easily fit into the old venue. So the number of participants must be pared down so that we can fit into the venue! Next time, if we go back to this same new venue, I will restructure all the events so that we can all fit!<\/p> <p>(1) Do I need to print and bring my ticket on event day?<\/p> <p>Nope. There will be a guest list and preprinted dating scorecards for the participants who have preregistered. You won't need your emailed ticket. But you SHOULD bring something to write with!<\/p> <p>(2) I RSVP'ed on Meetup. Am I registered for this event?<\/p> <p>Nope! Meetup RSVP's mean nothing. You need to get tickets on Eventbrite to be registered.<\/p> <p>(3) When should I register for these events?<\/p> <p>Sooner is better than later, but definitely don't wait till the last minute, as events do sell out. You should absolutely sign up NO LATER THAN TWO DAYS before the events. Why? Because if there aren't enough people registered the day before event day, I'll be cancelling the smaller events. If I cancel after you've signed up, you get refunded. But once I cancel, the event is gone. If you had signed up earlier, the event might have happened. Capisce?<\/p> <p>(4) Do you offer refunds?<\/p> <p>Nope. The official policy is no refunds, especially on or after event day. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>(5) I only see five people signed up for this event. Are you still going to hold it?<\/p> <p>Yes.\u00a0 You are looking at one Meetup group. This event is posted in multiple Meetup groups (usually 20 or so), as well as other external sites. There will be many people there!<\/p> <p>(6) I didn't receive my matches within 48 hours like you promised! What should I do???<\/p> <p>First, check your SPAM\/junk mail folder. If you don't find your matches, send me a message via Meetup or via text message, not via regular email. If you attended, I sent you your matches via regular email. If you didn't get them the first time, then you probably won't get them no matter how many times I resend them via email. So try Meetup messaging or texting, and I'll reply with your matches there.<\/p> <p>(7) It's been fifteen minutes since the event ended and I haven't received my matches yet!!! What should I do???<\/p> <p>Wait another 47 hours and 45 minutes. Then see the previous question.<\/p> <p>OR get one of the EXPEDITED MATCHES tickets and receive your matches much sooner!<\/p> <p>(8) How many people are signed up for the XYZ event?<\/p> <p>Sorry, but if I answer every person who asks that question, I will waste a lot of time doing so. In general, there tend to be more women than men signed up, but that is not always the case. And of course the numbers are changing constantly as people register!<\/p> <p>(9) Will there be an even number of men and women? I don't want to attend otherwise.<\/p> <p>Then you should not attend. There's never a perfect balance between men and women. First off, women are much more willing to sign up than men. Then, there are no-shows, and people who sign up for the wrong event. In short, it's impossible to have a perfect balance unless I've got 5 extra men and women for each individual event ready to hop in if needed. Of course, that's where having many volunteers helps a lot.<\/p> <p>(10) Why did you do away with the free BUDDY offer?<\/p> <p>I had implemented the BUDDY system as a way to keep balance between men and women, but not enough people were using it, and often those that did use it made mistakes while registering which made it even HARDER to keep the balance between men and women. So it's gone. Now, everyone registers himself, and that's it.<\/p> <p>(11) If I am attending only one event but decide while I'm there to attend a second, do I have to pay the walk-in rate?<\/p> <p>No. If you've already signed up for one event, you're in the system, so you'll just pay the extra $10 for the second event. It's people that aren't preregistered and aren't in the system that pay the walk-in rate.<\/p> <p>(12) I didn't like anyone at the event. Should I still turn in my datecard?<\/p> <p>YES! Missing datecards slow down the matching process. When I'm making the matches, I notice when someone has not turned in his card, and I'll send a message asking about it. So save us both some time and turn in your datecard. It's better if you turn in your card, so that I know that we have your card and that it was not lost or overlooked.<\/p> <p>(13) I forgot to turn in my datecard. What do I do???<\/p> <p>Scan in or take a picture of your datecard and send it to me via email, or send me a Meetup message with the list of people you chose, and I'll make your matches! But please do it ASAP, so I can finish within the 48-hour promised time window.<\/p> <p>(14) If I ask a question which you answer in this post, will you answer my email anyway?<\/p> <p>Heh heh heh.... Don't hold your breath! If you couldn't take the time to read the FAQ, why should I take the time to reply to your message?<\/p> <p>Any other questions? Just ask... after you've read the FAQ, of course!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Potbelly is on the first floor.

Each overall event will take less than an hour, so be prepared to meet new people in a short time! You'll fill out a form and pass it in at the end of the event. Then you'll receive an email with all your mutual matches within 48 hours!<\/p> <p>There will be different time slots and tables for different age ranges. Make sure you get the proper ticket!<\/p> <p>Okay, so what are the age ranges? They're as follows:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 6:30 - 7:30 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 **** CANCELED **** (1A) Ages 21 - 28 **** CANCELED ***<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1B) Ages 26 - 35<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1C) Ages 33 - 44<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1D) Ages 42 - 55<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 8:00 - 9:00 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2A) Ages 24 - 32<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2B) Ages 30 - 40<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2C) Ages 38 - 50<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2D) Ages 48 - 63<\/p> <p>VENUE:<\/p> <p>The Potbelly Sandwich Shop (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True<\/a><\/a>) is located in the Porter Square Galleria, right next to the Porter Square Red Line station. Behind the venue, there is a small parking garage with unlimited parking for us. The venue offers sandwiches and drinks, so you won\u2019t have to go hungry.<\/p> <p>TICKETS:<\/p> <p>Please sign up in advance to get the $10 price. Walk-ins will be allowed as long as the ratio of men to women is right but will pay $20 each per event (or $30 for two events.) Why do walk-ins pay more? Because they make a lot more work for me! So sign up in advance and get the darn-cheap $10 price.<\/p> <p>Lastly, please note that tickets stop selling at 2:00 pm on the day of the events. If you don't get a ticket online, you can try your luck as a walk-in...<\/p> <p>REFUNDS:<\/p> <p>The official policy is no refunds, unless an event gets cancelled. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>GUARANTEE:<\/p> <p>I would love to guarantee that you'll meet a minimum number of people, and I do my best to keep the numbers balanced, but at the end of the day, it's really tough. I can only guarantee that there will be at least three people of each sex registered before an event happens, otherwise it will get cancelled before event day. But there are things outside my controI, like no-shows and people who get the wrong ticket and then want to change once they've arrived. And did I mention no-shows? :)<\/p> <p>WHY REGISTER IN ADVANCE:<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you are guaranteed admission, you pay less, and you are much more likely to connect with your mutual matches. When you register online, all your contact info (name, email, cell) is in the system and ready to be used to match you up. When you show up as a walk-in, you have to hand-write all your info, and if I can't read it, I can't match you up.<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you're guaranteed to get in. Once the events sell out, there are no guarantees. It would be a shame to get there only to get turned away. We'll always try to accommodate people who show up, but there are no guarantees of admission.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>(0) You canceled\/refunded my ticket!!! Why???<\/p> <p>For these events on Dec 18th, the previous venue canceled with only 48 hours notice. I was able to find another venue, but it is much smaller and cannot hold all the people that would have easily fit into the old venue. So the number of participants must be pared down so that we can fit into the venue! Next time, if we go back to this same new venue, I will restructure all the events so that we can all fit!<\/p> <p>(1) Do I need to print and bring my ticket on event day?<\/p> <p>Nope. There will be a guest list and preprinted dating scorecards for the participants who have preregistered. You won't need your emailed ticket. But you SHOULD bring something to write with!<\/p> <p>(2) I RSVP'ed on Meetup. Am I registered for this event?<\/p> <p>Nope! Meetup RSVP's mean nothing. You need to get tickets on Eventbrite to be registered.<\/p> <p>(3) When should I register for these events?<\/p> <p>Sooner is better than later, but definitely don't wait till the last minute, as events do sell out. You should absolutely sign up NO LATER THAN TWO DAYS before the events. Why? Because if there aren't enough people registered the day before event day, I'll be cancelling the smaller events. If I cancel after you've signed up, you get refunded. But once I cancel, the event is gone. If you had signed up earlier, the event might have happened. Capisce?<\/p> <p>(4) Do you offer refunds?<\/p> <p>Nope. The official policy is no refunds, especially on or after event day. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>(5) I only see five people signed up for this event. Are you still going to hold it?<\/p> <p>Yes.\u00a0 You are looking at one Meetup group. This event is posted in multiple Meetup groups (usually 20 or so), as well as other external sites. There will be many people there!<\/p> <p>(6) I didn't receive my matches within 48 hours like you promised! What should I do???<\/p> <p>First, check your SPAM\/junk mail folder. If you don't find your matches, send me a message via Meetup or via text message, not via regular email. If you attended, I sent you your matches via regular email. If you didn't get them the first time, then you probably won't get them no matter how many times I resend them via email. So try Meetup messaging or texting, and I'll reply with your matches there.<\/p> <p>(7) It's been fifteen minutes since the event ended and I haven't received my matches yet!!! What should I do???<\/p> <p>Wait another 47 hours and 45 minutes. Then see the previous question.<\/p> <p>OR get one of the EXPEDITED MATCHES tickets and receive your matches much sooner!<\/p> <p>(8) How many people are signed up for the XYZ event?<\/p> <p>Sorry, but if I answer every person who asks that question, I will waste a lot of time doing so. In general, there tend to be more women than men signed up, but that is not always the case. And of course the numbers are changing constantly as people register!<\/p> <p>(9) Will there be an even number of men and women? I don't want to attend otherwise.<\/p> <p>Then you should not attend. There's never a perfect balance between men and women. First off, women are much more willing to sign up than men. Then, there are no-shows, and people who sign up for the wrong event. In short, it's impossible to have a perfect balance unless I've got 5 extra men and women for each individual event ready to hop in if needed. Of course, that's where having many volunteers helps a lot.<\/p> <p>(10) Why did you do away with the free BUDDY offer?<\/p> <p>I had implemented the BUDDY system as a way to keep balance between men and women, but not enough people were using it, and often those that did use it made mistakes while registering which made it even HARDER to keep the balance between men and women. So it's gone. Now, everyone registers himself, and that's it.<\/p> <p>(11) If I am attending only one event but decide while I'm there to attend a second, do I have to pay the walk-in rate?<\/p> <p>No. If you've already signed up for one event, you're in the system, so you'll just pay the extra $10 for the second event. It's people that aren't preregistered and aren't in the system that pay the walk-in rate.<\/p> <p>(12) I didn't like anyone at the event. Should I still turn in my datecard?<\/p> <p>YES! Missing datecards slow down the matching process. When I'm making the matches, I notice when someone has not turned in his card, and I'll send a message asking about it. So save us both some time and turn in your datecard. It's better if you turn in your card, so that I know that we have your card and that it was not lost or overlooked.<\/p> <p>(13) I forgot to turn in my datecard. What do I do???<\/p> <p>Scan in or take a picture of your datecard and send it to me via email, or send me a Meetup message with the list of people you chose, and I'll make your matches! But please do it ASAP, so I can finish within the 48-hour promised time window.<\/p> <p>(14) If I ask a question which you answer in this post, will you answer my email anyway?<\/p> <p>Heh heh heh.... Don't hold your breath! If you couldn't take the time to read the FAQ, why should I take the time to reply to your message?<\/p> <p>Any other questions? Just ask... after you've read the FAQ, of course!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Potbelly is on the first floor.

Fortunately for us, Potbelly is AWESOME, and they are working with us so that our events don't have to be canceled completely on such short notice! Special thanks to the GM, Alyssa... She ROCKS!<\/p> <p>Sadly, I must cancel the 21-28 event at 6:30 due to insufficient seating. Other events are getting pared down, as well.<\/p> <p>Walk-Ins -- Please be aware that there will be limited space in this new venue. We will probably not be able to accommodate most walk-ins like we have done in the past. You can try your luck, but there are no guarantees! Sorry!<\/p> <p>Potbelly will be offering us three free coupons, each good for a free sandwich, and each awarded to a lucky attendee! To qualify, you must:<\/p> <p>(1) get a paid ticket via Eventbrite (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bargaindating.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.BargainDating.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.BargainDating.com<\/a><\/a>), and<\/p> <p>(2) attend and turn in your completed scorecard.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Winners will be notified by me personally. :)<\/p> <p>=======================================<\/p> <p>BargainDating runs Boston's first affordable speed dating events. We're now in Porter Sq, at a sandwich shop, complete with a free parking garage, right next to the Red Line!<\/p> <p>Each BargainDate round will last between 4 and 10 minutes, depending on the number of participants. Each overall event will take less than an hour, so be prepared to meet new people in a short time! You'll fill out a form and pass it in at the end of the event. Then you'll receive an email with all your mutual matches within 48 hours!<\/p> <p>There will be different time slots and tables for different age ranges. Make sure you get the proper ticket!<\/p> <p>Okay, so what are the age ranges? They're as follows:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 6:30 - 7:30 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 **** CANCELED **** (1A) Ages 21 - 28 **** CANCELED ***<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1B) Ages 26 - 35<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1C) Ages 33 - 44<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (1D) Ages 42 - 55<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From 8:00 - 9:00 pm:<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2A) Ages 24 - 32<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2B) Ages 30 - 40<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2C) Ages 38 - 50<\/p> <p>\u00a0 (2D) Ages 48 - 63<\/p> <p>VENUE:<\/p> <p>The Potbelly Sandwich Shop (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.potbelly.com\/shops\/shoplocator.aspx#&amp;&amp;ss=False&amp;lng=[masked]&amp;sl=False&amp;s=02127&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;sid=310&amp;d=0&amp;lat=[masked]&amp;f=0&amp;v=True<\/a><\/a>) is located in the Porter Square Galleria, right next to the Porter Square Red Line station. Behind the venue, there is a small parking garage with unlimited parking for us. The venue offers sandwiches and drinks, so you won\u2019t have to go hungry.<\/p> <p>TICKETS:<\/p> <p>Please sign up in advance to get the $10 price. Walk-ins will be allowed as long as the ratio of men to women is right but will pay $20 each per event (or $30 for two events.) Why do walk-ins pay more? Because they make a lot more work for me! So sign up in advance and get the darn-cheap $10 price.<\/p> <p>Lastly, please note that tickets stop selling at 2:00 pm on the day of the events. If you don't get a ticket online, you can try your luck as a walk-in...<\/p> <p>REFUNDS:<\/p> <p>The official policy is no refunds, unless an event gets cancelled. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>GUARANTEE:<\/p> <p>I would love to guarantee that you'll meet a minimum number of people, and I do my best to keep the numbers balanced, but at the end of the day, it's really tough. I can only guarantee that there will be at least three people of each sex registered before an event happens, otherwise it will get cancelled before event day. But there are things outside my controI, like no-shows and people who get the wrong ticket and then want to change once they've arrived. And did I mention no-shows? :)<\/p> <p>WHY REGISTER IN ADVANCE:<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you are guaranteed admission, you pay less, and you are much more likely to connect with your mutual matches. When you register online, all your contact info (name, email, cell) is in the system and ready to be used to match you up. When you show up as a walk-in, you have to hand-write all your info, and if I can't read it, I can't match you up.<\/p> <p>When you register in advance, you're guaranteed to get in. Once the events sell out, there are no guarantees. It would be a shame to get there only to get turned away. We'll always try to accommodate people who show up, but there are no guarantees of admission.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>(0) You canceled\/refunded my ticket!!! Why???<\/p> <p>For these events on Dec 18th, the previous venue canceled with only 48 hours notice. I was able to find another venue, but it is much smaller and cannot hold all the people that would have easily fit into the old venue. So the number of participants must be pared down so that we can fit into the venue! Next time, if we go back to this same new venue, I will restructure all the events so that we can all fit!<\/p> <p>(1) Do I need to print and bring my ticket on event day?<\/p> <p>Nope. There will be a guest list and preprinted dating scorecards for the participants who have preregistered. You won't need your emailed ticket. But you SHOULD bring something to write with!<\/p> <p>(2) I RSVP'ed on Meetup. Am I registered for this event?<\/p> <p>Nope! Meetup RSVP's mean nothing. You need to get tickets on Eventbrite to be registered.<\/p> <p>(3) When should I register for these events?<\/p> <p>Sooner is better than later, but definitely don't wait till the last minute, as events do sell out. You should absolutely sign up NO LATER THAN TWO DAYS before the events. Why? Because if there aren't enough people registered the day before event day, I'll be cancelling the smaller events. If I cancel after you've signed up, you get refunded. But once I cancel, the event is gone. If you had signed up earlier, the event might have happened. Capisce?<\/p> <p>(4) Do you offer refunds?<\/p> <p>Nope. The official policy is no refunds, especially on or after event day. But you can always ask...<\/p> <p>(5) I only see five people signed up for this event. Are you still going to hold it?<\/p> <p>Yes.\u00a0 You are looking at one Meetup group. This event is posted in multiple Meetup groups (usually 20 or so), as well as other external sites. There will be many people there!<\/p> <p>(6) I didn't receive my matches within 48 hours like you promised! What should I do???<\/p> <p>First, check your SPAM\/junk mail folder. If you don't find your matches, send me a message via Meetup or via text message, not via regular email. If you attended, I sent you your matches via regular email. If you didn't get them the first time, then you probably won't get them no matter how many times I resend them via email. So try Meetup messaging or texting, and I'll reply with your matches there.<\/p> <p>(7) It's been fifteen minutes since the event ended and I haven't received my matches yet!!! What should I do???<\/p> <p>Wait another 47 hours and 45 minutes. Then see the previous question.<\/p> <p>OR get one of the EXPEDITED MATCHES tickets and receive your matches much sooner!<\/p> <p>(8) How many people are signed up for the XYZ event?<\/p> <p>Sorry, but if I answer every person who asks that question, I will waste a lot of time doing so. In general, there tend to be more women than men signed up, but that is not always the case. And of course the numbers are changing constantly as people register!<\/p> <p>(9) Will there be an even number of men and women? I don't want to attend otherwise.<\/p> <p>Then you should not attend. There's never a perfect balance between men and women. First off, women are much more willing to sign up than men. Then, there are no-shows, and people who sign up for the wrong event. In short, it's impossible to have a perfect balance unless I've got 5 extra men and women for each individual event ready to hop in if needed. Of course, that's where having many volunteers helps a lot.<\/p> <p>(10) Why did you do away with the free BUDDY offer?<\/p> <p>I had implemented the BUDDY system as a way to keep balance between men and women, but not enough people were using it, and often those that did use it made mistakes while registering which made it even HARDER to keep the balance between men and women. So it's gone. Now, everyone registers himself, and that's it.<\/p> <p>(11) If I am attending only one event but decide while I'm there to attend a second, do I have to pay the walk-in rate?<\/p> <p>No. If you've already signed up for one event, you're in the system, so you'll just pay the extra $10 for the second event. It's people that aren't preregistered and aren't in the system that pay the walk-in rate.<\/p> <p>(12) I didn't like anyone at the event. Should I still turn in my datecard?<\/p> <p>YES! Missing datecards slow down the matching process. When I'm making the matches, I notice when someone has not turned in his card, and I'll send a message asking about it. So save us both some time and turn in your datecard. It's better if you turn in your card, so that I know that we have your card and that it was not lost or overlooked.<\/p> <p>(13) I forgot to turn in my datecard. What do I do???<\/p> <p>Scan in or take a picture of your datecard and send it to me via email, or send me a Meetup message with the list of people you chose, and I'll make your matches! But please do it ASAP, so I can finish within the 48-hour promised time window.<\/p> <p>(14) If I ask a question which you answer in this post, will you answer my email anyway?<\/p> <p>Heh heh heh.... Don't hold your breath! If you couldn't take the time to read the FAQ, why should I take the time to reply to your message?<\/p> <p>Any other questions? Just ask... after you've read the FAQ, of course!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Potbelly is on the first floor.

It\u2019s also an opportunity to peacefully transform your problems, your fears, and any pain and stress in your life into something more positive.<\/p> <p>I also consider meditating one of the most direct and easiest ways to connect to your greater Spirit-Self, and to access all that it has to offer you.<\/p> <p>By participating in these transformational group guided meditations, you\u2019ll experience how simple,delightful and easy it can be. You\u2019ll learn and practice:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Simple yet profound techniques you can easily do for yourself for any length of time that is comfortable for you.<\/p> <p>\u2022 How to easily get into a meditative state to deeply relax and to create positive, pleasurable feelings, including inner peace, love, ease and joy; and how to bring that into your daily living.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Techniques to help you release stress and anxiety, and to shift your perspective and experience of those issues to a more positive perspective, instead.<\/p> <p>\u2022 How to connect to your inner resources and your best self, to solution consciousness, and how to activate your body's natural healing response.<\/p> <p>We have a different theme each time we meet to help you build and reinforce positive thinking patterns, beliefs and inner narratives that will support you in living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy.<\/p> <p>We typically have 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between to help you carry the positive feelings and lessons experienced into your day and life.<\/p> <p>This is a perfect time to let go of stress and \"busy-ness\", and to fully let go and relax into bliss. Come with whatever intentions suit you, and the evening is still sure to satisfy. It always works out magically that way.<\/p> <p>You're encouraged to bring a journal or notebook and pen to class.<\/p> <p>To encourage and support your practice, if you pay for 4 sessions, the fee will be only $60 (in-person, cash or check), to be used within 4 months of your payment.\u00a0 Or, you can pay for one class at a time for $20.\u00a0 Just RSVP each time you want to attend.

It is a time for gaining momentum and putting your best foot forward. My sound healings involve a range of Tibetan bowls and overtone chanting, but it is always specials to invoke the power of the moon in the healing we share!<\/p> <p>\"The first quarter moon is associated with the East and early morning.\u00a0 The First Quarter Moon magic is a time for gaining strength to complete your actions and decisions. Any obstacles or issues that arise during this time are easily overcome by concentration on drawing the Moon's energies down to Earth to push forward your goals despite doubts.\u00a0 Re-evaluation of your actions and recreation of your determination are supported by the magic of the First Quarter Moon.\u00a0 Emotions begin to influence your determination at this time, and it is beneficial to put the emotions into the passion to complete your goals.\" Sandra Lindsey\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?\u00a0<\/p> <p>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be answering the wake-up call to the divine presence ... And trust me, if you come, you will hear it ringing ; ) Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Pllease bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!

I am a Certified and Initiated Modern Mystery School Guide, Healer, and 3rd step Celtic Shaman Ritual Master. Since my teenage years, I've devoted my life to helping people know themselves and live their higher life purpose. I've studied in many spiritual traditions and offer tools for personal and planetary healing.<\/p> <p>Since 2004, I've had the honor and joy of working with over a thousand individual clients, plus many more in meditations and group classes. I've found that disconnection from self and purpose is the #1 reason why people seek healing. In my experience, joy is a process of deepening how much you know yourself, how much you're in alignment with your purpose, and how much service you are doing in the world.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-healers-network\/events\/226567082\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tree of Life Meditation and Journey","id":"226567082","time":1450485000000,"updated":1450492883000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1180109374000,"name":"The Boston Healers Network","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":511093,"urlname":"boston-healers-network","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02210","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"425 Summer Street","name":"The Westin Boston Waterfront","lon":-71.043282,"id":3068261,"state":"MA","lat":42.346085,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.67223000526,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446677268000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Can't make\u00a0Steppin' Out, well the Ebony Winter Gala has always been\u00a0an AMAZING night too.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/a\/7\/600_444739367.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us\u00a0for another Not to Miss event of the year.<\/p> <p>The United Minority Professionals (UMP) Ebony Winter Gala, a party of over 1,000\u00a0professionals of color is a not to be missed Happening.<\/p> <p>This is always a great time and one you want to definitely attend.<\/p> <p>My cousin Richard Cummings has Ebony Gala tickets for $65.<\/p> <p><b>Call him at\u00a0(508)[masked] for\u00a0tickets.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>He will meet you anywhere in Greater Boston.<\/b><\/p> <p>Advance tickets are $65<\/p> <p>At the door they are $80<\/p> <p>A few details:<\/p> <p>Friday December 18, 2015 from 8 PM until 2 AM<\/p> <p>at <b>NEW LOCATION<\/b> <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.westinbostonwaterfront.com\/\">Westin Boston Waterfront<\/a> 425 Summer Street 02210<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Lock in the\u00a0Ebony Winter Gala Special Westin Hotel Rate of\u00a0$145 for the night with an additional $30 for overnight parking\u00a0by\u00a0calling\u00a0[masked] with code NABA\/UMP BEFORE\u00a0December 6th.<\/b><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p>RESERVE NOW!!! $124 Online Westin Waterfront Holiday Rate which is BETTER THAN THE GROUP RATE\u00a0<\/p> <p>FYI....this rate includes parking and has FREE cancellation within 24 hours.

To fully understand why we are hosting this charity, you must first understand her story:<\/p> <p>\n\nFrom her sister, Sofia Hart:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"Olivia always thrived to do the best she could. Being gifted with horse back riding as our hobby (or life passion) growing up, she was incredibly fearless and passionate with everything in her. She was also happy to be a Vineyarder during her years playing Hockey and Soccer, representing the place she loved most, home. Her determination was unstoppable on and off horse back, the field, and the ice. These characteristics followed her through her life growing into adulthood.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nAs a recent University of Vermont graduate, she did just the same in her studies. When she felt defeated, she would do everything in her power to figure out what went wrong, and how she could fix her mistakes. While at her graduation, tears of joy were brought to my eyes as she smiled receiving her achievements and laughed and hugged with friends. Not only was she proud of herself, but she was even more proud of the people who surrounded her and their accomplishments too.<\/p> <p>\n\nThese qualities and characteristics went even further into the workplace. As a former employee of the Homeport Resturant, she used the skills and experience she learned there and carried it to the Seafood Shanty. Each and every job she has held has meant so much to her. Good days and bad days, she always would talk so highly of her job, especially for how dedicated she was to each establishment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThrough hardwork, fearlessness, dedication and most importantly, love, Olivia has gained a rather admirable reputation growing up on Martha's Vineyard for 22 years, and at UVM during her college years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThese amazing qualities and characteristics have not diminished one bit during these tough times. Her spirit is incredibly high, and she shocks us on a daily basis how positive her attitude is. I can not imagine being in her place, and handling the news she gets on a daily basis. Although she has received bad news many times, her positive outlook has not changed. Olivia is determined as ever, looking toward the brightest future.\"<\/p> <p>\n\nHere is more on Olivias condition, with a post from her Facebook page:<\/p> <p>\n\n\"So here it is. On the 9th I was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and diagnosed with a condition known as cardiomyopathy which is a disease of the heart muscle. There is damage to both the right and left portions but the majority of the damage is in the left ventricle. It wasn't until I had a cardiac MRI that the doctors realized my condition was most likely irreversible. The doctors believe it either began years ago when I most likely contracted a viral infection that attacked my heart or may have been something I was born with... the overall cause is unknown. My age enabled me to live and thrive with the condition until a couple of months ago. Currently, I am in the process of being placed on the heart transplant list, which I will hopefully be accepted to by the end of the week, and will receive a new heart by the start of the new year.

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (meaning you're ready to act when your company is up). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around 5 hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it, because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p>Due to some late arrivals in prior months, we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; last month we didn't finish either 1835 or 1830 until 9:30 PM or later). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p>Also since we usually know the people in the week or so prior it will be good at that point if we can sort out what games we want to play in advance. While it's no guarantee we can break down that way, knowing to set up something in advance is SUPER helpful and time saving. Setting up and teaching a new 18xx variant can take an hour or more and the games are quite long as it is, so every little bit helps.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

Conclusion and plan for next meeting: 5 minutes<\/p> <p><b>Recap of previous meetup<\/b><\/p> <p>11\/15\/2015 Six soul searchers attended today\u2019s meetup. \u00a0We had a very lively and personal discussion tonight.<\/p> <p>Three stimuli were provided in this meetup, which can be found in the photo album:<\/p> <p>Afghan widows struggle to survive the long shadow of war. After decades of conflict, many women are struggling on their own to care for themselves and their children.<\/p> <p>Robin Williams\u2019s widow Susan Schneider Williams points to undiagnosed Dementia as a suicide cause. Susan was Robin\u2019s third wife. She recently settled a legal dispute over Williams\u2019s estate with his three children by his first two wives.<\/p> <p>A matrilineal society called \u201cKingdom of Daughters\u201d still exists today in a lakeside village in southwestern China. \u00a0This society\u2019s official name is Mosuo, a minority ethnic group with a population of about 40,000. \u00a0The foundation of Mosuo culture is a centuries-old practice of walking marriage, in which men visit women at night to fulfill the need for procreation and sexual gratification. \u00a0Traditionally, a Mosuo woman might have several walking marriage relationships during her life, sometimes simultaneously. \u00a0Children take their mothers\u2019 surnames and daughters are preferred to sons.<\/p> <p>Many great questions were raised by soul searchers. \u00a0The group\u2019s favorite question for tonight was: \u201cWhat is love? - what does it take to make and keep a happy\/fair relationship?\u201d<\/p> <p>Other questions include:<\/p> <p>How to define power within a relationship? What does the \u201cideal\u201d relationships look like between male\/female lifetime mates for each each of us? What is the value of a man\/woman relationship? Life is so fragile and uncertain, yet we live so much in the future. Why? \u00a0What is the balance of now vs. later? Can one be happy alone without a companion? Why is it difficult for a group to welcome a new person into their circle, when the initial impression of the new person is not exciting? Is there a life after widowhood? Will co-housing work for single older people? Why hasn\u2019t the matrilineal culture spread? When is life not worth living? What is considered fair in a love relationship? How to live with loved ones who are suffering severe mental illness? What about the way cultures have evolved given the contrast of women in Afghanistan vs. Chinese matrilineal society.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be at the back separate session of the dinning hall, which is accessible from the backdoor towards the parking lot.

With a Sunday night show time of 9PM there is ample free parking is available.<\/p> <p>Season 1, the 2015 dates are as follows: September 13th, 20th and 27th, October 4th, 11th and 25th, November 1st 8th 15th and 22nd December 6th 13th 20th and 27th.<\/p> <p>The opening night on September 6th filled to capacity and guests were entertained by 7 professional comedians and show host C.J. Browne. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to offer a curated show of experienced local comedians. Since the room and setup require excellence the showcase is not an open mic night. We are absolutely psyched about the success of opening night. We played to a full house that loved the show.\u201d Show performer Gary Peterson says \u201cThe Slumbrew comedy show was such a fun room to work, because the owners care about making it fun. A packed house of young heroes supporting the local scene makes this place special. It makes me happy to know something so cool is alive in Somerville.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Comedy-shows-for-free-or-cheap\/events\/227417973\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Liquid Courage At Somerville Brewing ","id":"227417973","time":1450663200000,"updated":1450674968000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1285724355000,"name":"Boston-area Comedy Lovers - Comedy shows for free (or cheap)","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1714373,"urlname":"Comedy-shows-for-free-or-cheap","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"comedy lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":0.51155936718,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":38,"created":1441423236000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Winter begins on December 20 at 11:49 PM and ends on\u00a0March 20 at 12:31 AM.<\/p> <p>Are you an experienced winter hiker who is\u00a0working on your list of the high peaks during winter?

Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward so we can stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues both as individuals and together as a community. We have seen a huge surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas.

This all changes, however, on Christmas Eve, when a mysterious train visits Billy in the middle of the night, promising to take him and a group of other lucky children to the North Pole for a visit with Santa.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227309447\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytqbcc","time":1450744200000,"updated":1450755717000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02115","country":"us","city":"Boston","phone":"617-262-5555","address_1":"421 Marlborough St.","name":"The Corner Tavern","lon":-71.089286,"id":1408264,"state":"MA","lat":42.350024,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.20452427864,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448217481000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We have a quorum!

The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tuttle, which was first discovered in 1790. The shower runs annually from December 17-25. It peaks this year on the the night of the 21st and morning of the 22nd. This year the waxing gibbous moon will be bright enough to hide most of the fainter meteors. If you are patient, you might still be able to catch some of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>Source(s):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-current.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-current.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EverydaySpacer-com2\/events\/225899053\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Ursids Meteor Shower","id":"225899053","time":1450761300000,"updated":1450773506000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369503037000,"name":"Everyday Spacer Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":8638442,"urlname":"EverydaySpacer-com2","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Everyday Spacers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"South Boston","address_1":"380 West Broadway","name":"Fairway Mortgage","lon":-71.048729,"id":24162729,"state":"MA","lat":42.337624,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.89323139191,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445954659000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet every Tuesday morning at 380 West Broadway, at the new home of Fairway Mortgage.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Existing wireless technologies, including Bluetooth, WiFi and 3G and 4G cellular networks are ill-suited to large distributed deployments - either because they lack the range and scale required for IoT, or because their processing and power demands are ill suited for use on small, inexpensive and low-power endpoints.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>What's the solution?

And - for this group - what features do emerging, distributed IoT network offer to protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations that rely on them?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our December Security of Things MeetUp will delve into these issues and others, featuring presentations by- and discussion with experts from leading commercial firms deploying IoT networks in the U.S. and abroad and groups exploring community-based, open source alternatives to get distributed IoT devices talking.

We become a witness of these, cultivating a space of non-attachment and revealing a deeper connection with one's inner self.<\/p> <p>Newcomers to meditation and long-time practitioners are welcome to attend.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.
