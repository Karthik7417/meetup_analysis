Several of Mitchell's novels have been short- or long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and he has won numerous literary awards. Mitchell has become such a popular author that in 2007, he was listed among <i>Time Magazine<\/i>'s 100 Most Influential People in The World.<\/p> <p>David Mitchell reinvents himself with each book, and it's thrilling to watch. His novels like <i>Ghostwritten<\/i> and <i>Cloud Atlas<\/i> spill over with narrators and language, collecting storylines connected more in spirit than in fact. In <i>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet,<\/i> he harnesses that plenitude into a more traditional form, a historical novel set in Japan at the turn into the 19th century, when the island nation was almost entirely cut off from the West except for a tiny, quarantined Dutch outpost. Jacob is a pious but not unappealing prig from Zeeland, whose self-driven duty to blurt the truth in a corrupt and deceitful trading culture, along with his headlong love for a local midwife, provides the early engine for the story, which is confined at first to the Dutch enclave but crosses before long to the mainland. Every page is overfull with language, events, and characters, exuberantly saturated in the details of the time and the place but told from a knowing and undeniably modern perspective. It's a story that seems to contain a thousand worlds in one.<\/p> <p>The novel won the 2011 Commonwealth Writers' Prize regional prize (South Asia and Europe); was long listed for the 2010 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, was one of <i>Time Magazine<\/i>'s \"Best Books of the Year\" (#4 Fiction), and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. It was shortlisted for the 2011 Walter Scott Prize. It's fairly hefty--512 pages, so don't wait to the last minute to start reading this one!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/226691526\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"David Mitchell's The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet--Commonwealth Writers'","id":"226691526","time":1458496800000,"updated":1458506255000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"fresh meadow","address_1":"61-48 188th St","name":"Applebee's ","lon":-73.786362,"id":24363362,"state":"NY","lat":40.739971,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.7039175034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455283331000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It is all about costuming!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Maybe you are designing your next costume or maybe you want to start designing one.

It is your nature, so how can it be your attainment? It cannot be made an ambition.\u00a0<br\/>Mind is ambitious\u2014ambitious for money, for power, for prestige. And then one day, when it gets fed up with all these extrovert activities, it becomes ambitious for enlightenment, for liberation, for nirvana, for God. But the same ambition has come back; only the object he changed. First the object was outside, now the object is inside. But your attitude, your approach has not changed; you are the same person in the same rut, in the same routine.\u00a0<br\/>\"The day I became enlightened\" simply means the day I realized that there is nothing to achieve, there is nowhere to go, there is nothing to be done. We are already divine and we are already perfect\u2014as we are. No improvement is needed, no improvement at all. God never creates anybody imperfect.

(But beef prices are expected to go down this year). \u00a0So much so that the menu is printed without prices, and prices are actually hand-written.<\/p> <p>On my last visit last year, these were the porterhouse prices. A steak for two would run you $93. A steak for three would go $140. Steak for four costs $187. They do sell single steak at $45, but at a very minimum you want to get the steak for two to ensure you have the finest cut. Of course, your mileage may vary, but that should give you a good idea of how much money you need to set aside. A reminder that <b><i>they don\u2019t take credit cards<\/i><\/b>, so you need to bring a debit card, a Peter Luger card, or a big wad of cash! HAHA<\/p> <p>Peter Luger starts with USDA Prime Beef imported from the Midwest - states like Iowa! (Can you tell where I'm FROM?) LOL. This is the best beef you can buy. As the USDA puts it, USDA Prime is the superior grade with amazing tenderness, juiciness, flavor and fine texture. It has the highest degree of fat marbling and is derived from the younger beef. That\u2019s why Prime is generally featured at the most exclusive upscale steakhouse restaurants. \u00a0Then, they age the meat in their OWN aging facility here in NY.<\/p> <p>The perfect length of dry aging is 4-6 weeks, not months. The beef is hung in giant slabs (a la the movie Rocky) in huge coolers directly underneath the restaurant and kept at a constant humidity and temperature. After they\u2019ve aged, they\u2019ll have a blue cheese-like \u201cshell\u201d. The meat is a gorgeous red color at this point and is cut into porterhouse steaks. The leftover beef that isn\u2019t cut into steaks is ground into Peter Luger burgers. That\u2019s right, the burgers that Luger sells for lunch is made of the very same beef that their steaks are made of\u2013at a fraction of the cost. He implored us to come and try any day of the week before 4. The steak is then put under an 800 degree broiler. As it nears readiness, it\u2019s cut up, put on the plate, and then finished under the broiler (which is why the plate is hot when it comes out). (Note - this is the same\/similar process as Ruth Chris, who often tops their steaks off with a tab of butter.) \u00a0Then, you can top off your steak with some of the famous Peter Luger steak sauce. \u00a0Don't even go there to A-1! LOL<\/p> <p>I have to say, I really appreciated this \u201cinsider\u2019s look\u201d at why these steaks are so phenomenal. It only makes me reiterate the 5 stars.

If you would like to practice with us regularly, you must become registered with US Water Polo at the silver level and pay our annual membership dues.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We ask that any practice participants have some prior experience playing water polo and be able to swim a hundred yards in a row in less than two minutes. If you have a swimming background and are interested in learning water polo, please read the pdf below thoroughly and contact Alex Barclay. The coaching is typically geared to an intermediate level of play and we do work on basic skills at every practice. Everyone should be familiar with the basic rules and concepts of the game, as outlined in this pdf:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Practices typically include a swim set and some conditioning at the beginning, drills, and scrimmaging for the last 30-45 minutes (it's also ok to sit out and watch for the scrimmaging portion if it's your first practice). The first and third Sundays are geared towards scrimmaging and the second and fourth are more focused on skills and\/or conditioning. Bob or\u00a0Jeff\u00a0are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk in.

If you wish to attend and the RSVP is closed please send me an email and I will put you on a waiting list in case someone cancels.<\/p> <p>\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/7\/2\/600_320743122.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Persian-art-and-culture-lovers\/events\/228256452\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Norouz Celebration and New Member Dinner","id":"228256452","time":1458514800000,"updated":1458531450000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368992270000,"name":"Persian art and culture lovers in NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8550402,"urlname":"Persian-art-and-culture-lovers","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Persian enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.524105012417,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454941801000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/1\/f\/600_446801759.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>Free online program, based on \u2018The gospel of the holy twelve\u2019 by Jasper Gideon Ouseley<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Register for daily inspiration in the week before Easter<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/spiritualtexts.academy\/spiritual-easter\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/spiritualtexts.academy\/spiritual-easter\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/spiritualtexts.academy\/spiritual-easter\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nMar-20 morning: The passage<\/p> <p>Mar-20 evening: The last entry into Jerusalem (chapter 67)<\/p> <p>Mar-21 morning: Passing though the gate<\/p> <p>Mar-21 evening: The Christ within the soul (chapter 69)<\/p> <p>Mar-22 morning: The mystery of life and death<\/p> <p>Mar-22 evening: The cleansing of the temple (chapter 71)<\/p> <p>Mar-23 morning: The cleansing of the inner temple<\/p> <p>Mar-23 evening:The last Paschal supper and washing of the feet (chapters 75 + 76)<\/p> <p>Mar-24 morning: Surrendering to your inner master<\/p> <p>Mar-24 evening: The garden of Gethsemane and the betrayal of Judas (chapters 77 + 78)<\/p> <p>Mar-25 morning: Showing new inner strength<\/p> <p>Mar-25 evening: The Roman trial, the crucifixion and the burial (chapters 81 + 82 + 83)<\/p> <p>Mar-26 morning: The crucial victory over yourself<\/p> <p>Mar-26 evening: The resurrection and the appearance to two of Emmaus (chapters 84 + 85)<\/p> <p>Mar-27 morning: Liberation of the inner being<\/p> <p>Mar-27 evening: Jesus appearance in the temple and to the twelve (chapters 86 + 87)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b><i>Free online program, based on \u2018The gospel of the holy twelve\u2019 by Jasper Gideon Ouseley<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Register for daily inspiration in the week before Easter<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/spiritualtexts.academy\/spiritual-easter\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/spiritualtexts.academy\/spiritual-easter\/<\/a><br\/>\u200b<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/goldenrosycross-NYC\/events\/228699766\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Spiritual Easter","id":"228699766","time":1458514800000,"updated":1458527174000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1258407162000,"name":"Lectorium Rosicrucianum - New York City","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1557849,"urlname":"goldenrosycross-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"12 Saint Marks Place","name":"V-spot Organic","lon":-73.989288,"id":24225442,"state":"NY","lat":40.729012,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.45364844799,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457991786000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/3\/5\/600_447859765.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Vegans are coming!\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Vegans are coming!<\/p> <p>The vegans are taking over everything!

If you are excited to sign up for a season of Tinkergarten, our trial class will give you the chance to see, first hand, what a class feels like and how we inspire authentic, play-based learning for children (and a great time for all)! This free trial class is designed to be the first class in the Spring season of Tinkergarten. This class is designed for children 18 months through five years old and a treasured adult.<\/p> <p>Tinkergarten classes are based on a progressive curriculum comprised of our blueprint activities. The curriculum for each class is tailored to the ages and prior knowledge of kids, and are appropriate for the geographic region and season of the class. Leaders further tailor classes to meet the needs of the individuals and artfully facilitate the activity to maximize the fun and the learning for all involved. Below is a sampling of the types of activities to expect in this class.<\/p> <p><br\/>SAMPLE ACTIVITY - MAGIC PETAL POTIONS<br\/>Skills: Creativity, Imagination, Behavioral Schema, Sensory<br\/>For petal potions, kids put water and anything from nature into a jar and mix it up, just like we did when we were kids. Making potions never gets old, and if done with some finesse, it helps kids develop creativity, imagination, sensory skills and several universal ways to encourage brain development known as behavioral schema. Although we call it magic \u201cpetal potion,\u201d you can make magic potion anytime of year with any natural ingredients.<\/p> <p>SAMPLE ACTIVITY - KINGS AND QUEENS OF WILD THINGS<br\/>Skills: Creativity, Imagination, Behavioral Schema, Fine Motor, Self Esteem<br\/>Combine the magic of Maurice Sendak's \"Wild Things\" with the power of double-sided tape to turn a day outdoors into a brain-boosting, unforgettable, wild rumpus!<\/p> <p><b>SPACE IS LIMITED.

This requires re-imagining how data flows through your organization, moving away from data at rest and moving towards a completely event-based streaming architecture. Events become the lifeblood of the organization, while analytics becomes the brain. Organizations that successfully harness the power of real-time event streaming can transform analytical latencies from hours to seconds.<\/p> <p>This session will describe a reference architecture using the Lightbend Reactive Platform and other tools that can be used to build out the real-time organization, leveraging real-time data to produce analytics that result in immediate, actionable insights.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Talk 3.<\/b>\u00a0 <b>Using Apache Spark to create the Internet's first audience data firewall: How Mezzobit empowers digital enterprises to regain control of online data and increase customer value<\/b><\/p> <p>Speaker: <i>Joseph Galarneau<\/i>, CEO and co-founder, Mezzobit, New York<\/p> <p><br\/>ABSTRACT:\u00a0 Every website exposes visitors to data collection and tracking by scores of third parties, which site owners can\u2019t adequately monitor or control. The resulting data leakage siphons away revenue, slows site performance and increases compliance risk.Taming this problem requires gathering and processing billions of monthly data events per website.

Also, the manager mentioned that several items such as their beans used to be cooked with lard, but about a year ago they stopped doing that. This is happening because veganism\/vegetarianism is becoming more and more mainstream. It is up to us to continue this trend and show places like The Cheesecake Factory that they are on the right path and need to continue adding plant-based items to make their restaurants more accommodating to vegans\/vegetarians. Come out and help us do this and socialize with other like-minded, friendly people!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Directions:<\/b> If you are coming from Hoboken or north of Jersey CIty, you can take the West Side Ave or 8th Street Light Rail and get off at Newport.

Rosie Koostachin delivers donations to families who live in uninsulated sheds, overgrown with toxic mold. She is determined to raise awareness, believing that if only Canadians knew, her hometown's dire situation would improve. Over five years, filmmaker Victoria Lean follows Attawapiskat's journey from obscurity and into the international spotlight twice - first when the Red Cross intervenes and again during the protest movement, Idle No More.

But one of those Keys has just resurfaced and numerous factions are dead-set on possessing it. This means certain doom for the poor souls who've stumbled upon it.<\/p> <p>Are these unfortunate souls mere pawns in a greater game? Do they even know of that which fate has cast their way?<\/p> <p>If they are truly unaware of the significance of that which they now possess, it would be to their benefit to become aware of it. Fate and destiny have converged upon them and, before long, many will vie to possess the item they hold. Many will seek to become the Keeper of the Keys and our intrepid adventurers stand in their way.<\/p> <p>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I am looking to run this campaign as part of the Edison MeetUp group. However, I cannot run\/attend a weekly game. My schedule simply does not allow for it.<\/p> <p>So I'm setting this group up as a bi-weekly game; sort-of. Specifically, I will schedule a recurring MeetUp for the first and third Monday of each month beginning with February 15th, 2016. I will also schedule a bonus MeetUp for the fifth Monday of those months that have five Mondays. This means our first four meetings will be February 15th &amp; 29th and March 7th &amp; 21st.<\/p> <p>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game.<\/p> <p>Each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers.

Scan a human brain, then run a model with the same connections on a fast computer, and you have a robot brain, but recognizably human.<\/p> <p>Train an em to do some job and copy it a million times: an army of workers is at your disposal. When they can be made cheaply, within perhaps a century, ems will displace humans in most jobs. In this new economic era, the world economy may double in size every few weeks.<\/p> <p>Some say we can't know the future, especially following such a disruptive new technology, but Professor Robin Hanson sets out to prove them wrong. Applying decades of expertise in physics, computer science, and economics, he uses standard theories to paint a detailed picture of a world dominated by ems.<\/p> <p>While human lives don't change greatly in the em era, em lives are as different from ours as our lives are from those of our farmer and forager ancestors. Ems make us question common assumptions of moral progress, because they reject many of the values we hold dear.<\/p> <p>Read about em mind speeds, body sizes, job training and career paths, energy use and cooling infrastructure, virtual reality, aging and retirement, death and immortality, security, wealth inequality, religion, teleportation, identity, cities, politics, law, war, status, friendship and love.<\/p> <p>This book shows you just how strange your descendants may be, though ems are no stranger than we would appear to our ancestors. To most ems, it seems good to be an em.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker: Robin Hanson\u00a0<\/b>is associate professor of economics at George Mason University, and research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

We'll do out best to cancel meetups on holidays and days the space won't be available but you should also double check before coming out.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0While there are snacks and drinks at the space, lunch is not provided. There are a number of restaurants, delis and other places to get food in the area so plan accordingly<\/p> <p>\u2022 These daily coworking events are self run. A co-organizer will not always be at the event. These events are designed to give game developers a free space to work so you'll basically be left alone at the space to do you own thing. We suggest reaching out to other attending through the comments to sit together or meet up at a specific time in the space.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLast thing, two times a month we'll have a dedicated space for you to come out and work as well as listen to talks and get help from myself and others in the community. Those will be different events you'll need to register for which are separate from the daily co-working space.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/228630013\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":28800000,"name":"Indie Coworking Space","id":"htvgmlyvfbdc","time":1458655200000,"updated":1458685151000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Ground Floor","address_1":"309 East 85th Street","name":"Mis Amiguitos Spanish Montessori Program","lon":-74.005943,"id":24298490,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455761729000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello dear moms, Mis Amiguitos Spanish Program UES, is inviting to your child, 22 months to 4 years old for a drop off or drop in playgroup on <b>Mondays <\/b>and <b>Tuesdays<\/b> from 10:AM to 11:AM or<b> afternoons<\/b> from 1:PM to 2:PM or 2:PM to 3:PM and<b> W-Th-F's<\/b> from 1:PM to 2:PM or 2:PM to 3:PM . <b>Sat<\/b>.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

That land, where the life of the common man is cheap and reckless kings all-too-often burn their lives, and kingdoms, out in blazes of glory.<\/p> <p>The Korina Archipelago is home to several large city-states, each of which views the others as rivals, but generally coexist, for there are greater threats to their safety. Renegade Altameran privateers,\u00a0depraved nation-less pirates, demon-worshiping cannibals, horrors from the uncharted oceans, and far worse are reminders for the city-states of the constant dangers that exist outside their walls.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These dangers are all-too-real, and to whom can one turn to in times of desperation and need when threats arise? Each city-state will defend its own, but outside that, help is not easy to come by. Even the enlightened gods favor all, yet they favor none; those whose prayers and sacrifices are the most persuasive bend their ears for a time. The gods are powerful and wise, but fickle they are, too, and to understand their ways is not the way of man.<\/p> <p>This is no place for the weak of heart. Salvation comes from strength and strength alone. The strong survive, the weak do not.

Contrary to what some believe, these were not \"no brainers\" which could be dismissed out of hand. Instead, skeptics, such as James Randi and Joe Nickell, developed unique expertise in studying and developing explanations as to why things were not what their practitioners claimed.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now we have expanded into other areas, such as climate change, nurture versus nature issues, and.even economics and psychology. All of these are areas in which we have no specific expertise. There are a number of problems with this. The first one is the obvious one: we really don't have the expertise. Another one, and one I personally find more troubling, is that many of them are very ideologically loaded and we all bring strong biases to them.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As a skeptic organization we stay away from discussions of things like politics and ethics for, at\u00a0least to most of us,\u00a0obvious reasons. So, what other topics should we get involved in and how should these be treated? We should not shy away from controversial ones just because they are controversial, the issue is whether we are qualified or not. And when we are not, what type of experts should we bring to the discussion and what form should that discussion take?<\/p> <p>Benny Pollak is a founding member of NYC Skeptics.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

A main target of the FBI was an \"American\" organization called the Amerikadeutscher Volksbund, or the German-American Bund. Ideologically an extension of the Nazi Party in the United States, under investigation was \u00a0Capt Johannes S. Pritch and Dr. Loos Russo. The Bund was active throughout the U.S. in various forms from 1924 through America's entry into World War II and was often thought to be under the control of Berlin.<\/p> <p>One of the many FBI investigations into the Bund focused on a man named Carl Schiphorst. Schiphorst was the leader of the Bund's Bergen County Unit, a trustee in the largest Bund camp in New Jersey, an ardent National Socialist and suspected of being a Nazi contact man or agent. In other words: a Nazi spy.!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Plus, Schiphorst lived on a small dead end street in a quiet town named after a giant boulder in a valley \u2026 a town called Glen Rock.<\/p> <p>This presentation will examine the 148-page FBI investigation into Schiphorst and his family. At the same time, it will explore the German American Bund, \"Fifth Column\" mania, the internment of Germans during WWII and other topics.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The presentation will include period video footage as well as original artifacts obtained by Calaski, during one of his many explorations of the ruins of a nearby Bund camp. Following the presentation, Calaski will welcome questions from the audience.<\/p> <p>Calaski has been a detective with the Glen Rock Police Department for 14 years. He earned a master's degree in history in 2013 and wrote his thesis on the German American Bund. He discovered the investigation of a possible Nazi spy in Glen Rock while researching his thesis and continued this research after earning his degree.<\/p> <p>All welcome,<\/p> <p><br\/>Enjoy Robert\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GilligansAdventures\/events\/228420948\/","yes_rsvp_count":43,"name":"\" Spy Search \"","id":"228420948","time":1458687600000,"updated":1458700022000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1342406626000,"name":"The Adventures of Gilligan's  Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.1200027466,"id":4314992,"urlname":"GilligansAdventures","group_lat":40.9799995422,"who":"Castaway's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"14 Dekalb Ave","name":"CoLab-Factory","lon":-73.982368,"id":24299359,"state":"NY","lat":40.689743,"repinned":false},"headcount":45,"distance":4.19117736816,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456522180000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for the Brooklyn Entrepreneurship happy hour mixer! \u00a0Where you will meet creative and inspiring people in, or interested in Brooklyn's \u00a0startup, entrepreneurship, freelancer, and small business community!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>First time attending a Meetup in the startup scene?

Its very nice when this happens and it happens a lot.<\/p> <p>Tong Ren is another form of healing using tapping but unlike EFT it doesnt involve any dialog to describe the issues of concern. We just tap on a surragate model (Tong Ren) as if we were doing acupunture on a real body with intention of healing and it works!!!!<\/p> <p>We'll meet at Jain's home in Scarsdale every 2nd and 4th Tuesday evening and whoever is interested in joining us is welcome.

The key part is that you probably want to buy a discount card (called the County Card) you can use for the season. This discount card can also be used for the Galloping Hill Golf Course (since it\u2019s part of the same Union County system). This discount card is a mere $35 if you live in Union County and are a senior. But if you\u2019re outside of Union County the cost is $125 (again, the senior rate). Note: Chances are good we will play Ash Brook a number of times given its low cost, being a good course, and the fact that it\u2019s level enough that people can walk the course).<\/p> <p>COURSE CONDITIONS. All repairs\/upgrades are done now. All holes are fully open.<\/p> <p>ASH BROOK FACILITIES. They don\u2019t have a practice range. But there\u2019s a putting green next to the first hole. Ash Brook also has a food counter. But note that we aren\u2019t planning lunch there. So eat beforehand or grab something quick on site.<\/p> <p>WEATHER. The high next Wed. is forecasted to be a wonderful 66. That\u2019s the high for the week! No rain either.<\/p> <p>DRIVING. Unlike last summer, all the roads around Ash Brook are now fully open. Thus driving to Ash Brook should be easy.<\/p> <p>Note: I normally will send out meetup notices a couple of days earlier than this. However, I was away this time.

One eye-witness, <b><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frances_Perkins\">Frances Perkins<\/a><\/b>, cited this event as pivotal when she went on to become the first woman Secretary of Labor under FDR, instituting many of the workplace reforms we now take for granted.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/12494971_10153773912351421_2205984628069754806_n.jpg?oh=3d19f8f71d1cd550781047e3862eae38&amp;oe=574A88ED\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/12494971_10153773912351421_2205984628069754806_n.jpg?oh=3d19f8f71d1cd550781047e3862eae38&amp;oe=574A88ED<\/a><\/p> <p>Today, 105 years later, little has changed for women working in the garment industry. Global capital has simply shifted the work to other parts of the world where labor exploitation and the subjugation of women are commonplace. So we repeatedly bear witness to events like the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh that killed over a thousand victims, once again mostly young women and girls trapped in grimly similar circumstances.<\/p> <p>Yet we gather each year in solemn remembrance of these poor workers, and hope to draw attention to the plight of women still forced to labor under unsafe and inhumane conditions.

It\u2019s about designing a system of\u00a0constraints for people to ask the right questions, find purpose in their work,\u00a0and be empowered to make decisions and\u00a0constantly learn &amp; improve\u00a0through\u00a0experimentation and failure.<\/p> <p>\u201dLearning organizations are organizations\u00a0where people continually expand their capacity to design for the results they\u00a0truly desire;\u00a0where new and expansive mindsets are nurtured, where collective\u00a0aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to\u00a0see the\u00a0whole together instead of optimizing for the parts.\u201d \u2013 Peter Senge<br\/>\u00a0\nWhen people talk about the\u00a0application of Lean principles to knowledge work like software, what\u00a0immediately comes to mind?\u00a0Perhaps \u201cvisualize your work,\u201d using visual\u00a0management systems like Kanban? Perhaps the idea of removing waste from the\u00a0system\u00a0to increase flow of value? While both of these are incredible powerful\u00a0tools, many software companies believe that simply installing\u00a0Kanban boards\u00a0will move their organization forward. The reality is that it\u2019s missing the most\u00a0important aspect of the Lean (or the\u00a0Toyota Production System), which is the\u00a0use of A3 to create a continuously improving, learning organization.<\/p> <p>As Jim Womack from the Lean\u00a0Enterprise Institute says, \"The most basic definition of an A3 would be a\u00a0P-D-C-A storyboard or\u00a0report. The broader notion of the A3 as a\u00a0process\u2013embodying the way of thinking represented in the format\u2013captures the\u00a0heart of\u00a0lean management. In this context, an A3 document structures effective\u00a0and efficient dialogue that fosters understanding followed by\u00a0the opportunity\u00a0for deep agreement.\u201d<\/p> <p>This two hour introductory\u00a0workshop designed by PraxisFlow, will introduce the basics of design thinking\u00a0and A3, unpacking the\u00a0concepts and tools to introduce it into your\u00a0organization. We\u2019ll then integrate Edgar Schein\u2019s notion of Humble Inquiry to\u00a0teach\u00a0coaching strategies for mentoring knowledge workers in its application\u00a0towards designing better futures, solving problems, and\u00a0removing waste from the\u00a0value stream.<\/p> <p><b>Benefits:<\/b><\/p> <p>Through hands-on\u00a0instruction, small group discussions and exercises, the workshop participants\u00a0will:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Learn the basic concepts of design thinking and formats\u00a0of A3s and uses of the A3 as a learning process;<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gain experience in the three basic roles of the A3\u00a0process (Author\/Owner, Responder, Coach)<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Learn the four types of inquiry necessary for coaching A3\u00a0at the team, function, and leadership levels of the organization<\/p> <p>Who should attend:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Any leader who wishes to improve her organization<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Any designer who wishes to lead and manage her\u00a0organization more effectively<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lean and Agile coaches<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Human Resources and Organizational Development\u00a0professionals who wish to seek more effective means to deeply improve the\u00a0thinking, behavior, alignment, and\u00a0performance of their organization and the\u00a0people in it<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Senior executives who wish to improve their abilities to\u00a0lead and manage<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyone who wishes to improve his or her critical lean\u00a0thinking<\/p> <p><b>Presenter:<\/b>\u00a0Will Evans explores the convergence of practice and theory using Lean Systems, Design Thinking, DevOps, and LeanUX with global corporations from NYC to Berlin to\u00a0Singapore.
