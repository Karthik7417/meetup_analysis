Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Most of us install a commonly available anti-virus program, mind our clicks, and hope for the best. More than that seems like work, and stories of data theft have become so ubiquitous that a certain amount of desensitization is probably inevitable. Well, Goodman's book should take care of that. When your C.V. includes titles like \"futurist-in-residence with the FBI,\" you've seen who's creeping through those internet pipes, and it's harrowing; his litany of cyber criminals and their multitudinous misdeeds are often shocking in their inventiveness and audacity, and Goodman brings the nightmares one after another at an almost breathless pace. But not all is hopeless--Goodman aims to educate, offering from high-level policy to practical layman's advice for buttoning down your own data.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

On the side of what sucks on the side of what is sucked? There is an ambiguity here which nalytic theory has sometimes been led to speak about in connection with the breast and the mother, by emphasizing of course that they aren't the same thing. Does qualifying the breast as a partial object say it aU? When I say amboceptor, I'm emphasizing that it is just as necessary to spell out the maternal subject's relation to the breast as the nursling's relation to the breast. The cut does not pass through the same spot for one as it does for the other. There are two cuts, which are so far apart that they leave different off-cuts. For the child, the cutting of the cord leaves the envelopes apart. These envelopes are consistent with him, continuous with his ectoderm and his endoderm. For the mother, the cut lies at the level of the placenta as it falls away. This is even why it is called the decidua. The deciduous character of the object a, which shapes its function, lies there. The falling-away, the niederfallen, is typical when approaching an a that is nonetheless more essential to the subject than any other part of himself.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lyceum\/events\/225663099\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"JLW- Jacques Lacan Workshop Seminar X: Chapter XII","id":"225663099","time":1444174200000,"updated":1444649761000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1277258743000,"name":"Lyceum: Philosophy Reading & Discussion Group","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1665163,"urlname":"Lyceum","group_lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"711a Franklin Ave","name":"Hullabaloo Books","lon":-73.956604,"id":23256102,"lat":40.6744,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":5.51968479156,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443716487000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This week we will be workshopping a new chapter from Laina's novel.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/225813346\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Wednesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"225813346","time":1444251600000,"updated":1444270455000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"155 East 55th Street","name":"Shun Lee Palace","lon":-73.96907,"id":11273632,"state":"NY","lat":40.759457,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":1.2780059576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442433000000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Shun Lee Palace<br\/>155 East 55th (Lexington and 3rd)<br\/>Wednesday, October 7th<br\/>5:30 pm optional drinks, 6:15 pm dinner<br\/>$73 Includes meal below, tea tax &amp; tip (no wine).

This model, which brings together a variety of individuals and organizations to share a workspace, is intended to encourage knowledge sharing and community-building among professionals who would not otherwise be connected. It is changing the traditional way we look at the relationship between space and professional communities. How can architecture and design accommodate these trends and prepare for a more flexible future? How might architects themselves be using diverse work environments to leverage the benefits for doing their own work? We must be equipped to design for clients who desire facilitation of greater connection, communication and choice, in a variety of environments. This session will explore the evolution of coworking and its impact on both what and how we might be designing in the future.<\/p> <p><b>Panelists:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/agencies\/digiday-podcast-cos-rosemarie-ryan-agency-future-isnt-advertising\/\"><b>Rosemarie Ryan <\/b><\/a>is a renowned leader, brand builder and rabble-rouser in the marketing industry.

In recent years we've done an occasional event that was directly an activist event, but these have been few and far between.<\/p> <p>While we are, and will continue to be, mostly a social group, we'd like to step up the number of activist events we do.<\/p> <p><br\/>This October 7th event will be outreach to the general public to promote and encourage a vegan diet &amp; lifestyle. We will hand out literature in a welcoming manner so our audience will be open to seeing how great the benefits of veganism are\u00a0for people, the non-human animals who share our world, and the planet itself.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet at the designated location in Union Square at 6:30 pm (please arrive on time!). After a brief discussion on strategy and positioning of people, along with a few reminders for the group, we'll leaflet from 6:45 pm to 7:45 pm. Then our group will reassemble at the designated location and walk over to a nearby, all-vegan restaurant to have dinner, discuss our experiences and thoughts, and socialize.<\/p> <p>We know that not everyone in our group is vegan, but on this day we will be promoting veganism. You are very welcome to join us even if you are not yet 100% vegan, but please understand that the literature we will hand out will promote a purely vegan lifestyle. Mostly on this day you will be handing out literature rather than talking to people, but if you do happen to speak with people, we are promoting a vegan diet and lifestyle for\u00a0their tremendous benefits.<\/p> <p><b>Where to meet:<\/b> We will be meeting at the extreme southwest corner of Union Square Park, <b>where Union Square West meets East 14th Street.

You may want to plan on being there early in order to be on time. Don't be late! We will talk for 15 minutes and then disburse to various nearby locations in the park.<\/p> <p><br\/>We believe that grass-roots activism is vital in advancing the ideal, practice, and potential normalization of veganism in our world.

Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the <a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

in France and Spain.\u00a0 So I thought I\u2019d start up the group again by featuring one of the regions I visited: Languedoc in southern France.<\/p> <p>Along with neighboring Roussillon, with which the Languedoc is often linked, this is the largest single wine-producing region in the world, and accounts for a third of all French wine output.\u00a0 And this is in spite of the fact that production has been <i>reduced<\/i> in recent decades\u2014a vine-pull plan in the \u201890s, aiming to reduce a glut of surplus wine, eliminated lesser vineyards, and in those that remained there was a new focus on better production methods and higher quality varietals.\u00a0 New regulations limit the varieties that can be used in AOC wines and specify maximum percentages in blends.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>The best Languedoc wines are rich and robust, not unlike southern Rh\u00f4ne wines, with notes of spice and herbal <i>garrigue,<\/i> the scrubby vegetation one finds on the arid hillsides.<\/p> <p><b>MAJOR APPELLATIONS<\/b><\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4teaux du Languedoc<\/i> \u2013 This is a catch-all appellation (in the process of being renamed simply \u201cLanguedoc\u201d) that covers the entire region, and can be applied to wines that do not fall under more specific regional appellations while adhering to AOC Languedoc regulations.\u00a0 Wines must be made from at least two grape varieties, and no more than 40 percent can be either Carignan or Cinsault (considered inferior to \u201cimproving\u201d varietals such as Syrah, Grenache, or Mourvedre).\u00a0 Names of superior subregions can be appended to the Languedoc appellation, such as St-Dr\u00e9zery or Pic-St-Loup (the latter allowing no more than 10 percent Carignan).\u00a0 We will be trying two C\u00f4teaux du Languedoc wines, one each from Pic-St-Loup and St-Dr\u00e9zery, made by the prestigious Ch\u00e2teau Puech-Haut, which since its founding in 2000 has become one of the star producers of the region.<\/p> <p><i>IGP Pays de H\u00e9rault<\/i> \u2013 This is a \u201cvin de pays\u201d category that covers wines made anywhere in the H\u00e9rault department that do not conform to AOC regulations.\u00a0 This could include wines made from otherwise disallowed Bordeaux varietals, which can be among the most prestigious wines made in the Languedoc.\u00a0 We will be trying a Bordeaux blend made by Mas de Daumas Gassac, the so-called \u201cGrand Cru\u201d of the Languedoc.\u00a0 (I was able to visit this winery and tried this wine in their tasting room.\u00a0 Photos of vineyards and of grapes being transported into the winery.)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/b\/c\/600_442323772.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/c\/6\/600_442323782.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Picpoul de Pinet<\/i> \u2013 This is the signature white wine of the Languedoc, the grape\u2019s name derived from \u201cpique-poul,\u201d meaning \u201csting the lip,\u201d an appropriate descriptor for this brightly acidic wine (I\u2019ve always thought of it as a southern Muscadet).\u00a0 We will be trying the only Picpoul ever to have earned the <i>coup de coeur<\/i> from the French <i>Guide Hachette des Vins,<\/i> that publication\u2019s highest honor.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Corbi\u00e8res <\/i>\u2013\u00a0 This is the largest appellation in the Languedoc and one of the largest in France, and the widely varying terroirs result in wines of equally various styles and quality levels.\u00a0 Most of the production is red (made from at least two grapes, of which Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvedre must make up at least 50 percent of the blend), but small quantities of fine white wine are made.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Corbi\u00e8res white made up of Grenache Blanc and Grenache Gris.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Minervois<\/i> \u2013 Another large appellation, centered on the ancient and picturesque village of Minerve (photo).\u00a0 Minervois has seen considerable investment, with a corresponding increase in the prestige of their wines.\u00a0 The wines must be blends, made up of at least 60 percent Grenache, Syrah, and\/or Mourvedre.\u00a0 We will be trying a well-priced blend of mostly Grenache that was inspired by the winemaker\u2019s ten years spent in Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/b\/1\/600_442323761.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Faug\u00e8res<\/i> \u2013 A highly regarded appellation with vineyards situated on steep, south-facing slopes.\u00a0 Yields are low and the growing season is long, resulting in rich, southern Rh\u00f4ne\u2013style wines.\u00a0 We will try an example by one of Faug\u00e8res\u2019 best winemakers, L\u00e9on Barral, whose wine (unusually these days) consists of 50 percent old-vines Carignan.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be returning to one of our old reliables, Harper\u2019s in Dobbs Ferry.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/harpersonmain.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/harpersonmain.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/harpersonmain.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2013

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

This is why Mayor Baraka and I are asking leaders, educators, organizers, producers, innovators, doers, and influencers in politics and activism, technology and social media, the arts and entertainment, sports, the faith communities, the health, wellness, and fitness arena, and corporate America to come to Newark for this national gathering of America\u2019s best minds, especially the younger generations: Generation X and the millennials. We will assemble, United Nations-style, not just to talk, but to exchange ideas and models of success, and action steps that are working and needed in local communities across America. We aim to build and create a 21st century brand of social change, where the people come first and their voices are heard.\u201d<\/i><br\/>\u00a0\nSays Mayor Baraka:\u00a0<i>\"The entire city of Newark is privileged and honored to host the BK Nation national conference. The decision to bring this important 3-day event to Newark is recognition of our groundbreaking initiatives and intense work to fundamentally transform our community. This conference will unite leaders and activists from across the nation to find solutions to the chronic and acute problems and crises that we face as a people and society, in a vast range of fields. It will also put a spotlight on the programs we have created\u2014our Town Halls, our Model Neighborhood Initiative, our Centers of Hope, which are setting a standard and example for the entire nation. With unity and love, with compassion and commitment, this conference will put forward the agenda and solutions we need to transform America into a nation we can all believe in.\u201d<\/i><br\/>\u00a0\nAs America nears the end of the Obama era and a new presidential election in 2016 it has become clear that there is much to do to create freedom, justice, and equality for all people. In spite of President Obama\u2019s historic victory in 2008 with the help of a progressive and multicultural army, there remains, in our America, deep racial divisions and violence, violence against women and girls and gender inequities, and discrimination against people because of their faith or religious beliefs, their ability or disability, their sexual identities, and because they are poor or otherwise struggling to make it financially.<br\/>\u00a0\nThought leaders of all stripes have been particularly alarmed by the explosion of conflict between police and communities, by the number of Black males who\u2019ve been shot and killed by law enforcement, by the ever-growing prison-industrial complex, by the reckless disregard for our environment, for food justice for every community, by the many health disparities, by the random use of guns that have decimated both impoverished inner cities and affluent suburbs.<br\/>\u00a0\nThe national gathering will be free but each participant must register and cover their own expenses around travel, food, and lodging. The conference will conclude with a cultural festival at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center\u00a0Saturday\u00a0evening,\u00a0Oct. 10th, featuring live music, live visual art, dance, short films, fashion displays, comedy, dramatic monologues, and poetry. Otherwise the entire conference will be held at Rutgers University, the Newark campus.<br\/>\u00a0<\/p> <p>To learn more about the conference please visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/kevinpowell.us8.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=4889d51ccf4d5ca83c3ae2e0a&amp;id=8ff5e37013&amp;e=a76e3af455\">www.bknation.org\/nationalconference<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note the conference will feature a livestream and live tweets throughout the 3 days.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Newark-Social\/events\/221838064\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":226800000,"name":"National Conference on Leadership,Ideas & Action Steps: Kevin Powell&Ras Baraka","id":"221838064","time":1444305600000,"updated":1444533370000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1275532119000,"name":"Newark Social","group_lon":-74.1699981689,"id":1655201,"urlname":"Newark-Social","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1290 Avenue of the Americas","address_2":"16th Floor","lon":-73.981041,"phone":"917-862-8929","name":"AXA Advisors LLC","id":5728202,"state":"NY","lat":40.760937,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":35,"headcount":0,"distance":0.890907943249,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443727462000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>2nd, 3rd and 4th Thursdays of each month (except when there is a holiday) from 8:15-9:30AM we conduct our presentations, networking and business development meetings for entrepreneurs, consultants, salespeople and business owners in the NY Tri-state area.

Just close your eyes and let your mind flow with these beautiful ancient melodies, get in the zone, let go of those emotional tensions that have been bottling up, cry a little if you feel like to.<\/p> <p>The meditation\/relaxation session starts with 15 minutes of guided meditation, then 20 minutes of music, after that we spend approx 45minutes or so introducing ourselves to each other, discussing and sharing difficulties or happiness in our lives if you choose to. We spend the last 15-20 minutes relaxing to the music again.<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Cost<\/b>:\u00a0 First timers: Free<\/p> <p><br\/>Repeaters: $10 (cash) to cover group incurred expenses and organizing fees,\u00a0 will be collected at the meeting.<\/p> <p><b>Guidelines<\/b>:<\/p> <p>Please arrive 10-15 minutes early, we will promptly start at 5pm,\u00a0 door will be closed to prevent disturbance once the meditation is in session.<\/p> <p>We meet in the downstairs conference room, if you can't find it simply ask a front desk person where the Meditation Group Meeting is as you enter the library.<\/p> <p>Bring your own water to drink.<\/p> <p>Bring your own yoga mat if you wish to sit on the floor, or there are chairs in the room you can sit on.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP responsibly, only sign up for this meetup if you have a true intention to attend and be on time.\u00a0 If you must cancel, please kindly hit the \"change\" button switch to \"no\", so other people on the waitlist can move up.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1e2I2Ep.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HhpmIZT.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/everythingbrooklyn\/events\/225810112\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":6300000,"name":"Self Healing Circle and Guided Meditation\/Relaxatio\u00adn Therapy with Music","id":"225810112","time":1444338000000,"updated":1444345940000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1339437557000,"name":"Everything Brooklyn","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":4054132,"urlname":"everythingbrooklyn","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Brooklynites"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"115 W 45th Street (Between 6th & 7th Ave.)","name":"Cranberry Cafe","lon":-73.94519,"id":6580602,"state":"NY","lat":40.813438,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.9805932045,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423802479000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTICE: While we officially start at 5pm, please feel free to join us anytime after 5pm.

I am so excited to meet all of you. Looks like we have a great bunch of girls coming. The weather is turning out to be perfect for this venue. This is a spectacular year round rooftop venue. Primary cocktails. The do have a fabulous light bite snacking menu. If you RSVP and don't show we will remove you from the group. This is for girls that just want to have fun! There has been a change in the reservations since we had such a great response. We were forced to change the reservation status to \"open\" because of a ridiculous deposit they were asking to hold the table. The rep from the venue assured me \u00a0that at the time we are arriving we should have no issues with getting a great table. I will post my status \u00a0on this page when I check in. I have also posted a picture of me in the photo section of the meetup. Hopefully this will help us find one another. Of course if you are having trouble you can message me on this meet up page.
