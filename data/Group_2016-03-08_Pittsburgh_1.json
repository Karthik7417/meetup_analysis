This particular group is for all heterosexual people who are looking to date. Are you recently divorced or 20 years out of a divorce? Are you widowed and thinking you want to get back out there? Are you single and starting over? THIS is the place to be...this introduction just might be a new chapter for you. We have either heard it all or been there....meeting the wrong people, the wrong types, online, offline...the list goes on. We have often heard not enough men at an event.....not enough women at an event.....people want to be text friends only....this group wants to change that and the way people think. A common complaint is that when meeting online...pictures are 20 years old and the person was nothing like the profile. I will ask for a picture and a few short questions so that we get to know everyone better and here is the best part---you WILL get to meet in a group setting and judge for yourselves. That first introduction is KEY. There will never be a charge for this group. I want you to be able to come and go and sign up for events as you see fit. I encourage anyone in or out of the area to join us because you just never know when the right opportunity knocks...and just think...what if you were not there to answer the door? LOL---(someone else is dating your perfect match) LOL.....Remember God put eyes on our face instead of the back of our head so we will always look forward and not back. I do have a few ground rules. 1. No players--this is not a game and you are no longer 24. 2. No clowns---this is not a circus. 3. No stalking---when someone tells you that they are not interested.... Believe them. Issues such as the above mentioned will not be tolerated. Just ask my friends in Meetup. You will be deleted from the group. I think that this could be a great way to get out there and just put it on the table and openly say that you are interested in dating. Please be single, divorced or widowed and if you are not----someone will tell ---Guaranteed ---so please be HONEST! Join us and just have FUN!!! Be open to this and receive it!
