Since we, as Gen X in our older\/wiser age, tend to be more selective about where and how we travel, this group\u2019s focus is on non-touristy, responsible travel (to local, domestic and international destinations).<\/p>\n<p>Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool, distinctive destinations (e.g., Iceland) with lots of character, as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community, which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains. Our broad definition of Gen-X means people in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s (and early 60's), so our goal with the age preference is simply to bring together folks who are in the same general age bracket with similar high quality values and adventurous spirit. Besides our guiding principles, we go wherever we want to go! Near and far, domestic and international, beach and city, mountains and lakes, adventure and relaxation, day trips to two week getaways and everything in between. This is our travel club and it\u2019s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool, fun places and are looking for like-minded, new friends to travel with, then this is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>How do we decide where to go? Easy\u2026 while we\u2019ll offer some trips, and we\u2019ll chat about locales of interest at local meet-ups. Our local meet-ups are a fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhoods in and around Annapolis. Always new places to check out and many neighborhoods to keep up with\u2026 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality, local Annapolis area outings (e.g., walks\/hikes, volunteering) to keep in touch, continue our travel ideas and build lasting friendships with our neighbors. In the spirit of building a high quality meet-up community, we are asking member to provide a clear membership profile picture, answer our questionnaire, and RSVPing to events only if you seriously plan to attend. Why are we incorporating these rules? We are asking for clear profile pictures to help us recognize you\u2026. asking for the completed questionnaire so we can better serve the community\u2026 and asking for accurate RSVP\u2019s to help us plan accordingly, manage events and ensure fairness for outings that require an accurate head count. These are some easy breezy requests which will go a long way to help us create an even better meet-up group.<\/p>","lon":-76.5100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14040381,"name":"Gail","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/highres_172801462.jpeg","photo_id":172801462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/member_172801462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/thumb_172801462.jpeg"}},"members":91,"name":"Annapolis Gen X Travel Club (late 30's, 40's, 50's)","id":19873735,"state":"MD","urlname":"Annapolis-Gen-X-Travel-Club-late-30s-40s-50s","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":39,"who":"Gen-Xers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461424617000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"polyamory","name":"Polyamory","id":494},{"urlkey":"alternaparent","name":"Alternative Parenting","id":3765},{"urlkey":"tantric","name":"Tantra","id":10146},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"intimacy","name":"Intimacy","id":15187},{"urlkey":"swingers-parties","name":"Swingers Parties","id":22971},{"urlkey":"alternative-lifestyles","name":"Alternative Lifestyles","id":24818},{"urlkey":"swinger","name":"Swingers","id":61474},{"urlkey":"swingers-lifestyle-dance-parties","name":"Swingers Lifestyle Dance Parties","id":98629},{"urlkey":"bdsm-and-domination-submission","name":"BDSM and Domination\/submission","id":131148},{"urlkey":"kinky-fetishes-bdsm","name":"Kinky - Fetishes & BDSM","id":165968},{"urlkey":"polyamory-and-open-relationships","name":"Polyamory and Open Relationships","id":167798}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Swinging-Across-Maryland\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Swingers, kinksters, nudist and poly persons this is a open play social group for you.

In this meetup group, we'll be doing this with PURPOSE and STRUCTURE.&nbsp; Okay, what does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>(1) We'll use Gaming to calm jitters, banish awkwardness, and make interactions a whole lot more natural and fun.<\/p>\n<p>(2) We'll use Group Questions to start to get to know everyone - and to discover icebreaker topics that YOU AND OTHERS are mutually interested in and want to talk about.<\/p>\n<p>(3) Once your interaction muscles are all warmed up, we just encourage natural, organic conversations to take place.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in case you're wondering, you won't be forced to make friends with anyone you don't feel you hit it off with - that's NOT what this group is about. The goal of this group is that: If you and someone would have become good friends - BUT ONLY IF initially you'd gotten to know one another more and subsequently had enough opportunities to interact - well, this group's purpose is to provide you and your future friends THOSE OPPORTUNITIES to find out about one another and to interact. AND to do this in a fun way that reduces the friction of social interaction among strangers. AND you'll get a chance to meet almost everyone rather than just one or two people the whole evening.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you're reasonably serious about making new friends, come and join us on the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of each month. I look forward to getting to know you and helping you meet and get to know your future friends. --Kevin C.
