Let's do it! We will hike around Schunemunk Mountain, just about 60 miles north of New York.<\/p> <p>The Schunemunk Mountain loop (the longest way) is an 11 mile hike with a good 1,500' of elevation gain. We will visit the summit of Schunemunk and the Megaliths, where we'll have near 360 degree views of the Highlands, Hudson River, Kittatinny Ridge, Shawangunks and the Catskills. From the summit we will head back down either by the Jessup and Trestle trail or via the Dark Hollow trail\/Sweet Clover trail.<\/p> <p>This is a strenuous hike (1,360'+ vertical rise, some rocky terrain and scrambling). Take with you a lunch snack and 1.5 liters of water. Be prepared for late fall weather, possibly rain or snow, wind and cold. Good boots are a must since ground could be wet. Other gear questions will be answered individually via e-mail.<\/p> <p>We should be leaving New York City in cars around 8 a.m. on Saturday, November 28, and arriving back to NYC around 7 p.m.\u00a0We may stop for dinner on the way back if there is interest.<\/p> <p>The number of participants is limited only by the number of available cars.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoodsprograms to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/227062776\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"227062776","time":1448718300000,"updated":1448733722000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"79th & 5th","name":"Central Park","lon":-73.96373,"id":21381632,"state":"NY","lat":40.776989,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.32127428055,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447078798000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Captains Meet 9:30 at the Trailer.

Translated literally as \u201cthing to wear,\u201d the kimono has gone through major transformations throughout history: in the Edo period (1615\u20131868) it was an everyday garment, and now it is worn mainly on special occasions and collected as \u201ctraditional Japanese art.\u201d Its design, function, and meaning have shifted dramatically in the last one hundred and fifty years, shaped by the dialogue of Japanese traditions, modern inventions, and Western ideas. Featuring more than fifty spectacular robes, this exhibition tells a story about the Japanese garment whose designs mirror trends in pictorial and decorative arts of every era. Both sumptuous garments custom-made for wealthy patrons and everyday wear available for sale to the general public are represented. Highlights also include three examples of contemporary kimono created by designers designated by the Japanese government as Living National Treasures.<\/p> <p>Some twenty-five robes on loan from private and public collections, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the John C. Weber Collection, Julia Meech Collection, and others complement examples from the Metropolitan\u2019s Asian Art and Costume Institute collections; they are exhibited together with paintings, prints, and illustrated books, as well as lacquerware and ceramics, that share common design patterns with kimono. These T-shaped robes, decorated with a seemingly infinite variety of designs, not only reflect fashion trends but reveal much about Japanese culture, history, and society if we unlock the circumstances of their manufacture, sale, and ownership.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BORN-FREE-ARTS\/events\/226947892\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Kimono","id":"xtbnclytpblc","time":1448722800000,"updated":1448734737000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1348356984000,"name":"BORN FREE ARTS","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":5055262,"urlname":"BORN-FREE-ARTS","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Culturistas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10310","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"South St","name":"Front of Staten Island Ferry Terminal in Manhattan","lon":-74.116951,"id":8173792,"state":"NY","lat":40.63335,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.4710350037,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441036760000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per non-member","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bring your friends and relatives and join the other Shore walkers for our annual post-thanksgiving walk from Battery to the Little Red Lighthouse.

The highly acclaimed Museum at FIT (Fashion Institute of Technology) has free exhibits. \u00a0Let's spend a Saturday morning learning more about the world of fashion. \u00a0Optional lunch and shopping trip to Macy's afterward with 12-15 Meetup friends in town from Washington, DC.<\/p> <p>\n\nAbout the MuseumThe Museum at FIT, accredited by the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/museum\/about\/accreditation.php\">American Alliance of Museums<\/a>, is one of a select group of specialized fashion museums, including the Muse de la Mode, the Mode Museum, and the Museo de la Moda. For the 100,000 people who visit The Museum at FIT each year, we work to create exhibitions, programs, and publications that are both entertaining and educational. The mission of the Museum is to advance knowledge of fashion through exhibitions, programs and publications. Founded in 1969, the Museum was installed in the current building in 1974, and exhibitions began to be presented in 1975. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/museum\/about\/director.php\">Dr. Valerie Steele<\/a>\u00a0has been director of The Museum at FIT since 2003 and chief curator since 1997.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThe Museum at FIT (MFIT) is best known for its innovative and award winning special exhibitions, including\u00a0London Fashion, which received the first Richard Martin Award for Excellence in the Exhibition of Costume from the Costume Society of America;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/museum-at-fit.culturalspot.org\/exhibit\/the-corset-fashioning-the-body-2000\/ywLSW2u2jYt1Kw\">The Corset: Fashioning the Body<\/a>\u00a0, which explored the most controversial garment in the history of fashion; and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/sites.fitnyc.edu\/depts\/museum\/gres\/\">Madame Grs: The Sphinx of Fashion<\/a>\u00a0, a monographic retrospective that examined the working methodologies and unique aesthetic contributions of a great couturier. Recently, the Museum has been mounting even more ambitious exhibitions, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/museum\/exhibitions\/past\/2008-2009\/gothic-dark-glamour.php\">Gothic: Dark Glamour<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/21048.asp\">A Queer History of Fashion: From the Closet to the Catwalk<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/21048.asp\">.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>The museums permanent collection encompasses some 50,000 garments and accessories from the 18th century to the present. Important designers such as Adrian, Balenciaga, Chanel, and Dior are represented. The collecting policy of the museum focuses on aesthetically and historically significant directional clothing, accessories, textiles and visual materials, with emphasis on contemporary avant-garde fashion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nThere are three galleries in the museum. The lower level gallery is devoted to special exhibitions, such as the recent\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/21912.asp\">Elegance in an Age of Crisis: Fashions of the 1930s<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fitnyc.edu\/museum\/exhibitions\/past\/dance-and-fashion.php\">Dance and Fashion<\/a>. The Fashion and Textile History Gallery, on the main floor, which provides on-going historical context, presents a rotating selection of approximately 200 historically and artistically significant objects from the museums permanent collection. Every six months, the exhibition in the gallery is completely changed, although it always covers 250 years of fashion history.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nGallery FIT, also located on the main floor, is dedicated to student and faculty exhibitions, such as the Art and Design Graduating Student Exhibition every May, which also fills the lower level gallery and lobbies across campus. Students from FIT's School of Graduate Studies also collaborate with the Museum's staff to mount a professional museum exhibition once a year.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nWe invite you to gain an intriguing perspective on the culture of fashion through the museum's engaging programs and publications. Our educational programming, Fashion Culture, includes free lectures, panel discussions, fashion conversations, and guided tours. The museums most ambitious program, the annual Fashion Symposium, features noted scholars, authors, and curators from around the world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nIn addition to its three exhibition galleries, the museum is composed of a conservation laboratory, photographic studio, workshop, more than 14,000 square feet of on-site storage space, three classrooms, and offices for 30 full-time employees. Members of the staff of The Museum at FIT have specialized skills in the conservation, documentation, exhibition, and interpretation of fashion.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0<b>Fashion Institute of Technology<\/b>, generally known as\u00a0<b>FIT<\/b>, is a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/State_University_of_New_York\">State University of New York<\/a>\u00a0(SUNY) college of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Art\">art<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">business<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Design\">design<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_communication\">mass communication<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">technology<\/a>\u00a0connected to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fashion_industry\">fashion industry<\/a>, with an urban campus located on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/27th_Street_(Manhattan)\">West 27th Street<\/a>\u00a0between\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seventh_Avenue_(Manhattan)\">Seventh<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eighth_Avenue_(Manhattan)\">Eighth<\/a>\u00a0Avenues in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chelsea,_Manhattan\">Chelsea neighborhood<\/a>\u00a0of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manhattan\">Manhattan<\/a>, New York City.<\/p> <p>It was founded in 1944,\u00a0accredited in 1957,\u00a0and is ranked among the top five fashion schools in the world.\u00a0It has an enrollment of more than 10,000 students.<\/p> <p>\n\nThanks!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Kelleman<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the Main Entrance - Look for People With Meetup Stickers (and Robert is 6-5)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYHistoryAndCulture\/events\/227034130\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":5400000,"name":"The Museum at FIT - The Fashion Institute of Technology (Free)","id":"227034130","time":1448724600000,"updated":1448731673000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445789269000,"name":"New York History & Culture: Walking Tours and Museum Meetups","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19059593,"urlname":"NYHistoryAndCulture","group_lat":40.75,"who":"New Yorkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"401 Broadway, 25th Floor @ Canal St.","name":"Artsy","lon":-74.00267,"id":15228322,"state":"NY","lat":40.718838,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":2.25759863853,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439657859000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Here's the idea: come join other NYC developers for a peer-based learning lab.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant\u2019Andrea della Valle to hide in one of the chapels. Once he has disappeared, a sacristan enters and then the painter Mario Cavaradossi, who sets to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. The painting has been inspired by the Marchesa Attavanti, whom Cavaradossi has seen in the church but does not know. While he works, he compares the dark-haired beauty of his lover, the singer Floria Tosca, to that of the blonde Marchesa Attavanti (\u201cRecondita armonia\u201d). Angelotti, a member of the former Bonapartiste government, ventures out and is recognized by Cavaradossi.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/1\/600_434702833.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The painter gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling from outside. Suspicious, she jealously questions Cavaradossi, then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa. Suddenly recognizing the Marchesa Attavanti in the painting, she accuses him of being unfaithful, but he assures her of his love. When Tosca has left, Angelotti emerges from the chapel. A cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, and he and Cavaradossi flee to the painter\u2019s villa. The sacristan enters with choirboys who are preparing to sing in a Te Deum that day celebrating a victory against Napoleon. Their excitement is silenced by the arrival of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, who is searching for Angelotti. When Tosca comes back looking for Cavaradossi, Scarpia shows her a fan with the Attavanti crest that he has just found. Seemingly finding her suspicions confirmed, Tosca bursts into tears. She vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia sends his men to follow her to Cavaradossi\u2019s villa, where he thinks Angelotti is hiding (\u201cTre sbirri... Una carozza...\u201d). While the congregation sings the Te Deum, Scarpia declares that he will bend Tosca to his will.<\/p> <p>Act II\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/e\/600_434702814.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 In his study at the Palazzo Farnese, Scarpia sadistically anticipates the pleasure of having Tosca in his power (\u201cHa pi\u00f9 forte sapore\u201d). The spy Spoletta arrives, explaining that he was unable to find Angelotti. Instead he brings in Cavaradossi. While Scarpia interrogates the painter, Tosca is heard singing at a royal gala in the same building. Scarpia sends for her and she enters just as Cavaradossi is being taken away to be tortured. Frightened by Scarpia\u2019s questions and Cavaradossi\u2019s screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti\u2019s hiding place. Cavaradossi is carried in, hurt and dazed. Realizing what has happened, he angrily confronts Tosca, when the officer Sciarrone rushes in to announce that, in a surprise, Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia\u2019s side. Cavaradossi shouts out his defiance of tyranny and is dragged off to be executed. Scarpia, calmly resuming his supper, suggests to Tosca that he would let Cavaradossi go free if she\u2019d give herself to him. Fighting off his advances, she calls on God, declaring that she has dedicated her life to art and love (\u201cVissi d\u2019arte\u201d). Scarpia insists, when Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, now forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia\u2019s proposition. The baron seemingly orders a mock execution for Cavaradossi, after which he is to be freed. Spoletta leaves. As soon as Scarpia has written a safe-conduct for the lovers, Tosca kills him with a knife she had found earlier on the table. Wrenching the document from his hand, she quietly leaves the room.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/5\/600_434702901.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Act III<br\/>At dawn, Cavaradossi awaits execution at the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo. He bribes the jailer to deliver a farewell letter to Tosca. Overcome with memories of love, he gives in to his despair (\u201cE lucevan le stelle\u201d). Tosca enters. She explains to him what has happened and the two imagine their future in freedom. As the firing squad appears, Tosca instructs Cavaradossi how to fake his death convincingly, then hides. The soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Cavaradossi to hurry, but when he doesn\u2019t move, she realizes that Scarpia has betrayed her and that the bullets were real. Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for murder. She cries out to Scarpia and leaps from the battlement.<\/p> <p><b>Tickets<\/b><\/p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metopera.org\">metopera.org<\/a>.\u00a0 Click on calendar.\u00a0 Select November 28's date.\u00a0 Select the Tosca evening performance.\u00a0 Then, select your seat of choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/8\/6\/600_434699526.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>At 12:00 pm We will meet in the lobby in front of the opera gift shop. \u00a0<\/b><\/i>We will also meet at intermission on the lower level (below the orchestra) lounge for drinks or tea.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations.

The story takes place in the year 10,191. The universe is governed through a system of feudal rule, presided over by Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/jos%C3%A9-ferrer-p89648\">Jos\u00e9 Ferrer<\/a>), who appears to take his marching orders from something that resembles a talking vagina. In the kingdom are two rival houses -- the House of Atreides and the House of Harkonnen. Each house is trying to gain dominion over the universe, but that dominion can only be gained by the house that controls the Spice, a special substance that permits the folding of time. The Spice is only available on the desert world of Arrakis, or Dune. Shaddam, tired of the feuding between the two houses, permits the Atreides to take over the Spice production on Dune, while secretly working with the Harkonnens to launch a sneak attack on the Atreides and destroy them. The leader of the Atreides is Duke Leto (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/j%C3%BCrgen-prochnow-p57905\">J\u00fcrgen Prochnow<\/a>), who rules with the help of his concubine Jessica (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/francesca-annis-p1867\">Francesca Annis<\/a>) and son Paul (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/kyle-maclachlan-p44254\">Kyle MacLachlan<\/a>). The rival Harkonnens are headed by the pus-oozing degenerate Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/kenneth-mcmillan-p47905\">Kenneth McMillan<\/a>, in a thoroughly through-the-roof performance) and his two unsavory nephews, Rabban (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/paul-l-smith-p111942\">Paul L. Smith<\/a>) and Feyd (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/sting-p112828\">Sting<\/a>). When his father is murdered by the Harkonnens, Paul escapes to Dune, where he is greeted by the Fremen (the desert dwellers on Dune who prepare the Spice) as the messiah foretold in Fremen legend.

Told through a series of almost motionless tableaux and staged on elaborate trompe-l\u2019oeil sets that simulate vertiginous perspectives and geometrically impossible spaces, the film is Andersson\u2019s wry retelling of Don Quixote, with the gallant knight and his loyal aide reimagined as a pair of traveling practical joke salesmen. Flashbacks take us from a glum, denatured present to an all-too-vivid past that includes references to Sweden\u2019s position in World War II, hideously inventive colonial atrocities and a 1709 military defeat that marked the end of Sweden\u2019s global ambitions. But for all of the film\u2019s sense of horror and despair, Andersson\u2019s wit and compassion shine through.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/events\/1549?locale=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/events\/1549?locale=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/events\/1549?locale=en<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor admissions and visitor information\u00a0 click here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Be advised that MoMA members can now reserve tickets 2 weeks in advance which makes many films sell out.\u00a0THIS IS ONE THAT MAY SELL OUT.<\/p> <p>You can reserve a ticket online.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf there's interest dinner will follow at the Thai restaurant across the street.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>IMPORTANT.\u00a0 READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CHOOSE TO RSVP.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>1.

The space created is sacred and safe for all of us to share our experiences - our thoughts and feelings, our presence, and the rhythms of our breathing as we participate in the expansion of our touch perception.<\/p> <p>This event is expanding now to include everyone interested in evolving their 'touch intelligence'. It has been a monthly women's gathering and a wonderful opportunity to share and celebrate our intention, strength, and life experience!<\/p> <p>You're invited to join this ongoing class at any time. It is 'by donation', because your healing presence is the most important material you can contribute! So please come and donate your body to the science of healing - we will return it renewed and energized.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Every gathering starts with an introduction of ourselves in a circle. You will be introduced to this simple healing touch method. We will practice on each other on the floor lined with yoga mats and blankets. You may want to wear comfortable clothes and bring a yoga mat. This program is designed for every body shape and sensory ability - or sensitivity!\u00a0<\/p> <p>HETEP facilitator, Karuna Ma has been introduced to healing touch very early in life. Since 1998, qualified as a Reiki Master Healer and Seichim Master Teacher.

Since her training in 2001, Karuna has been working as a massage therapist, energy and sound healer.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Montclair_Shamanic_Circle\/events\/226651128\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"HETEP Healing Touch Program","id":"jgbnjlytpblc","time":1448755200000,"updated":1448764434000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1314900121000,"name":"Montclair Shamanic Circle","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":2424042,"urlname":"Montclair_Shamanic_Circle","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Shamanic Practioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07030","country":"us","city":"Hoboken","address_1":"38 Jackson St. 2nd Floor","address_2":"Use black double doors at south end of Jackson st.","name":"MakerBar","lon":-74.041795,"id":6693352,"state":"NJ","lat":40.737305,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.85582017899,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442905133000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/0\/c\/event_440081484.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>As part of our outreach to <b>T.O.O.O.L.(<a href=\"http:\/\/toool.us\/\">The Open\u00a0Organization\u00a0Of LockPickers<\/a>},<\/b> we are sponsoring a monthly Lockpicking event to encourage like minded individuals to gather, greet, and pick the night away!!! \u00a0No experience required, just a desire to learn is all that is needed. \u00a0Anyone can learn to pick, if you don't believe us, come on down to <b>MakerBar<\/b> and try it for yourself!<\/p> <p>At this time, we are also requesting donations of locks, ...old rusty pad locks(or shiny new ones), door locks (old or shiny[<b>we love shiny locks<\/b>]), combination locks, handcuffs (with or without keys), prison shackles(no questions asked...wink, wink), practice locks, bicycle locks, key safes, combination safes, etc... in general anything that has a lock may be donated. \u00a0 If you have any of the above mentioned locks, and would be happy to donate them, please bring them with you when you come to help increase the diversity of locks to pick.<\/p> <p>Come have a beer (or two[we don't count]) with us, and have fun picking away with fellow pickers!!

The twisty final sector features a complex of low-speed corners that require good aero grip and balance.\u00a0The day-night nature of the race presents an interesting technical challenge for the teams because the track temperature drops by as much as 15 degrees when darkness falls.<\/p> <p><b>TYRE ALLOCATION<\/b>\u00a0- \u00a0Pirelli will be bringing the\u00a0two softest tires in the range - soft and super soft tires for Abu Dhabi, the same combination last seen in Russia due to the smooth asphalt.<\/p> <p><b>TALKING POINTS<\/b> - Can Rosberg continue to hold-off Hamilton for another win in Abu Dhabi to make it 3 in a row?

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226778284\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpbmc","time":1448805600000,"updated":1448817169000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hartsdale","address_1":"475 w hartsdale ave, hartsdale NY","name":"Pat Capone rd football field","lon":-73.79995,"id":24225494,"state":"NY","lat":41.030727,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":21.8332195282,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406687537000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ATTENTION!

She is a constitutional and property law professor at Fordham Law School, and a deeply experienced leader in the fights for economic and political equality and against concentration of wealth and control in the hands of the few.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Teachout is best known for her efforts to limit the influence of money on politics. Her arguments were cited in the Citizens United case by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. She is one of the leading legal experts on corruption. She has worked on political campaigns at every level, culminating thus far in a 2014 campaign for New York Governor. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>After the market crash of 2008, Teachout co-founded a group dedicated to breaking the power of Wall Street banks. After graduating law school at Duke, she founded a criminal defense nonprofit in Durham, NC, where she helped lead the fight against the death penalty. It was during these years Zephyr came to understand that lawmaking is not a science but rather a moral and political art. \u00a0<\/p> <p>It is with this in mind that Teachout published her first book in 2014, Corruption In America: From Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Snuff Box to Citizens United, discussing the trend of loosening restrictions on campaign finance and warning that \u201cwe could lose our democracy in the process.\u201d Teachout is also a notable antitrust and environmental activist. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Teachout grew up and attended public school in rural Vermont before going on to Yale. Her first job after Yale was as a special education teacher's aide in a small rural public school.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nEntry to our 100-year-old building and meeting rooms is available for most wheelchair users with prior arrangements.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

These two neighborhoods have many surviving brownstones and townhouses that date from the Civil War period to the 1890s. One side street even resembles Brooklyn's Carroll Gardens neighborhood with leafy,\u00a0spacious\u00a0gardens in front of the townhouses. We will also see examples of \"adaptive reuse\" of old warehouses, horse stables, and\u00a0churches that have been converted to apartment houses.\u00a0And as we walk through these historic districts, we will\u00a0see a number of\u00a0murals that have been transforming Jersey City into an outdoors art gallery. In the middle of the walk, we will briefly stop outside of\u00a0Historic Harsimus Cemetery where\u00a0sometimes\u00a0animals are roaming around.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression. My Certification level is Merlin\u2019s Grace, one the most powerful levels of the Vortex Healing\u00ae.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression. My Certification level is Merlin\u2019s Grace, one the most powerful levels of the Vortex Healing\u00ae.

It subtly adds tremendous stress on those who practice it, and the long term effects are even worse\u2014according to the British Journal of Psychiatry (January 2013), such people can develop mental illness.<\/p> <p>Here's the right way to do it.\u00a0 There are eight steps derived from the time-tested teaching of Jesus Christ that most churches will never teach you:<\/p> <p>1) <b>C<\/b>onsciousness -- You start with being aware of your ego state<\/p> <p>2) <b>A<\/b>bandonment -- You overcome your ego<\/p> <p>3) <b>R<\/b>ebirth -- You receive the benefits of the new life above ego<\/p> <p>4) <b>E<\/b>dification -- You nurture your new life above ego<\/p> <p>5) <b>F<\/b>orbearance -- You develop grace and mercy<\/p> <p>6) <b>R<\/b>efinement -- You cultivate a pure heart<\/p> <p>7) <b>E<\/b>nlightenment -- You shine your light to the world<\/p> <p>8) <b>E<\/b>ndurance -- You stand against the winds<\/p> <p>Notice that the above eight steps form an acrostic <b>CAREFREE<\/b> because the result of this spiritual fitness plan is true freedom, happiness, and fulfillment. More than that, you will see miracles happening in your life because God promises to bless you when you walk this path.<\/p> <p>That is how to go from being LOST to FULFILLMENT, from spiritual bareness to fruitfulness, from a stressful roller-coaster life to constant joy.\u00a0<\/p> <p>And if you are serious about living a fruitful, fulfilled, and carefree life, join us for a four-week workshop on spiritual fitness during this Advent season.<\/p> <p><b>WHEN: <\/b>There are two options available:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Saturday AM Group<\/b>: meets weekly at 10:00am \u2013 11:15am, starting November 28, 2015<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 <b>Sunday PM Group<\/b>: meets weekly at 7:00pm \u2013 8:15pm, starting November 29, 2015<\/p> <p><b>WHERE:\u00a0 <\/b>Trinity Presbyterian Church, 650 Pascack Road, Paramus, NJ 07652<\/p> <p><b>CONTACT<\/b>: Sam Stone: email <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>,<br\/>or call Sam at[masked]-1133.<\/p> <p><b>COST:\u00a0 <\/b>Free Will Offering (Suggested $80, or $20 for each class)<\/p> <p><b>Sign up today and let\u2019s make this new year the greatest year in your life!<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The nearest cross road is Oradell Ave.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spiritual-Fitness-Club-Join-the-Happiness-Movement\/events\/226916897\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":4500000,"name":"How to be Spiritually Prepared for a Fruitful Year - Part 1 of 4 (Evening Group)","id":"226916897","time":1448841600000,"updated":1448847152000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1428521147000,"name":"Spiritual Fitness Club - Join the Happiness Movement!","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":18538975,"urlname":"Spiritual-Fitness-Club-Join-the-Happiness-Movement","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Saints"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07079","country":"us","city":"South Orange","address_1":"18 South Orange Avenue #2","name":"South Mountain Yoga","lon":-74.25901,"id":14584482,"state":"NJ","lat":40.745945,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.1128578186,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448022583000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet every Sunday night from 7:30-8:45 pm at South Mountain Yoga.

I do notice the people who RSVP and then cancel which really isn't fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean or anything but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Also even if the meetup is full please do put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. I will also try to give an idea in advance if it looks like there might be more spots. Also, if there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to succeed. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members.<\/p> <p>This show is for the 10pm show this week. if you would like to come for the 8, there will be an organizer who will give you tickets.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/2\/600_444481826.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/226982184\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup at Stand Up NY 2 drink min.

The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook.

What was New York when the Europeans got here? Who came? What was here and what did they do with it?<\/p> <p>Manhattan became a base of operations because of a combination of features found nowhere else: a vast harbor, an ice-free port, hills and valleys offering both protection from enemies and access into the interior\u2026. In the 1660s a man wrote home, \u201cIt is as though God intends the trade of the world to locate here,\u201d and in the 1780s, when New York was home to a mere 25,000, George Washington said it was destined to become the great city of the world.<\/p> <p>Remnants of these hills, streams and forests suggest the influence of pristine Manhattan on the city, the nation and the world.<\/p> <p>The founding Dutch left the area 350 years ago but their imprint remains an active influence in and around downtown, their world-view an indelible part of New York City. Dutch use of resources that made New York\u2019s rise a certainty affects and even determines our actions to this day.<\/p> <p>Register at: <a href=\"http:\/\/brooklynbrainery.com\/courses\/early-new-york-city?utm_source=Brooklyn+Brainery+List&amp;utm_campaign=e819b65a8b-November_3_201511_3_2015&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_eac11a979f-e819b65a8b-388610837\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/brooklynbrainery.com\/courses\/early-new-york-city?utm_source=Brooklyn+Brainery+List&amp;utm_campaign=e819b65a8b-November_3_201511_3_2015&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_eac11a979f-e819b65a8b-388610837<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Walks-and-Talks\/events\/226553253\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Early New York City - The Dutch Imprint on New York","id":"226553253","time":1448924400000,"updated":1448931037000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410371238000,"name":"NYC Walks and Talks","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":16918472,"urlname":"NYC-Walks-and-Talks","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Local History Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"222 Broadway, 19th Floor ","name":"WeWork Fulton Center","lon":-74.008675,"id":18117572,"state":"NY","lat":40.711262,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.85552215576,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443731850000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/f\/5\/600_444322261.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Hi Everyone,<\/p> <p>Just before 2015 ends and 2016 starts, we gather with some of the leading decision makers of enterprise companies to learn about their mobility strategy and plans.<\/p> <p>Come and learn how top-tier architects and business people see the future of mobile and mobility;<\/p> <p><i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/art-harris-68889\">Art Harris<\/a><\/i>, Mobile Lead Architect at\u00a0Metlife,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/stefaniehandsman\"><i>Stefanie Handsman<\/i><\/a>,\u00a0Head of Treasury Services Division at\u00a0Bank Leumi USA\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ariel-elkayam-b31709\"><i>Ariel Elkayam<\/i><\/a>,\u00a0Business Unit General Manager - at\u00a0ACBS SyndTrak FIS, will share with us their\u00a0challenges and goals for mobility and how they are building a sustainable mobile strategy for their organization.<\/p> <p>We will get a unique insight into how banks and insurance companies are planning their mobile strategy, as well as how product companies are helping their clients to securely make that transition into mobile.<\/p> <p>We will meet for some refreshments and networking at\u00a06:00PM\u00a0at the WeWork Fulton Center and then enjoy a great and lively panel with our guests.<\/p> <p>Due to high demand, we have a expanded the capacity of participants to 70 people - so please RSVP.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mobile-Enterprise\/events\/225761042\/","yes_rsvp_count":85,"duration":9000000,"name":"Enterprise Mobile Strategy - Preparing for 2016","id":"225761042","time":1448924400000,"updated":1448983281000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1361208627000,"name":"NYC Enterprise Mobility","group_lon":-74,"id":7235762,"urlname":"Mobile-Enterprise","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Mobilizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"292 Graham Ave","name":"Action Burger","lon":-73.944008,"id":22635272,"lat":40.712231,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.55804038048,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448771404000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Get your practice on for the tournaments and exchange strategies with other members.

Part 2 describes different types of mind in detail, revealing the depth and profundity of the Buddhist understanding of the mind.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself.
