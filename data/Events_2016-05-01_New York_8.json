If we can get at least 3 total we will meet for golf. So replay \u201cyes\u201d to let me know if you\u2019re pretty sure you can play golf next Thurs. (4\/21). Let me have your tentative \u201cyes\u201d by Tues. (4\/19) by 9:00 AM. I\u2019ll then make reservations for 4\/21 and ask for your final (and definite) \u201cyes\u201d.<\/p> <p>This meetup is open to everybody. In other words, breaking 100 is not a have to have (although nice to have). Where we plan to play (Hyatt Hills) is also the shortest of any of the courses we play.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve listed a start time of 12:30. If you have a preference for another time let me know given that this meetup is still tentative.<\/p> <p>For those not familiar with Hyatt Hills it\u2019s a nine hold course. But we can play 18 holes (due to a different pin and tee box location for the second round of nine). Hyatt also has a nice practice range (including a chipping area and a practice sand trap). Two restaurants are on site. So come earlier if you want to practice some first. I\u2019m sure I will.<\/p> <p><br\/>The weather forecast for 4\/21 is text book perfect: 72 degrees and sunny.<br\/>- - - - - - - - - - -<br\/>BACKGROUND ON OUR NEW PROCEDURE<br\/>Going forward, we will organize our golf outing with a two-step process as being done here (as well as was done last week). In other words, we will first do a nose count of who thinks they can come. After the nose count, we will finalize golf reservations and ask people to firmly commit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This new two-step procedure is being done so that we can manage reservations more smoothly. For example, a while back I made reservations for 8 people. However, only 3 were actually able to come. When I cancelled reservations for 5 people I\u2019m sure I burned up a little goodwill with the course. Plus cancelling at the last minute puts me at a slight risk of getting charged for the cancellations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>So my apologies for making your \u201cyes\u201d to a golf outing a two-step process. But I think this will work better.

Meetups are informal gatherings for educators who work with (or are interested in working with) Scratch. The meetups are organized into three parts:<\/p> <p>1. We start with networking over light refreshments, getting to know fellow attendees and sharing what people want to explore during the meetup.<\/p> <p>2. We collaboratively decide how to structure our learning and then form small groups based on our different interests. Maybe you want to have a discussion about classroom strategies or get more practice with Scratch\u2014or something else entirely. Feel free to move between groups if the session that you're in isn't working for you.<\/p> <p>3. We gather as a whole group for dinner and group sharing. You might pose a question to discuss with the group, or share something from your classroom. This is a great time to inspire and be inspired.<\/p> <p>Want to know more about meetups?

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside and Booker T Washington as backups.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 12pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

The first part discusses some fundamental patterns and problems behind continuous streaming applications in general, and how we built Apache Flink 1.0 to handle these problems. The talk will dig into questions around latency critical applications, fault tolerance and processing guarantees (exactly once, how to achieve then end-to-end), into processing data streams by \"event time\", or \"processing time\", handling out-of-order event streams, and about migrating, repairing, or versioning live streaming programs.<\/p> <p>2. The second part of the talk is a technical deep dive into Apache Flink, discussing how the functionality discussed from a user and application point of view is actually implemented. The talk will cover the integration with Apache Kafka, the mechanisms behind fault-tolerance and high-availability, event time and windowing, savepoints and program reinstatements, as well as techniques for managing large online state.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b>: Stephan Ewen is a committer in the Apache Flink project and co-founder and CTO of Data Artisans.

Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports a schema-free data model and scales easily. But it also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios.<\/p> <p>We begin by explaining NoSQL and document databases, and how they compare with traditional relational database platforms. Then we tour the many features of DocumentDB, including rich querying with SQL (that\u2019s right, you query this NoSQL database using SQL!), and client development using the REST API and the DocumentDB SDKs. Next, learn about the server-side programming model and write fully transactional stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. Also explore tunable consistency, scale-out partitioning, custom indexing, attachments, and more. Attend this session, and get up to speed on DocumentDB today!<\/p> <p><i>Goals<\/i><\/p> <p>Get introduced to NoSQL, document databases, and Microsoft Azure DocumentDB.<\/p> <p>Understand the differences between NoSQL and relational database platforms, and when to choose one or the other for your next application.<\/p> <p>Learn about the unique NoSQL features of DocumentDB, including rich query over schema-free data, client development, server-side programming, tunable consistency, indexing, partitioning, and attachments.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Lenni Lobel:<\/p> <p>Leonard Lobel (Microsoft MVP, SQL Server) is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Sleek Technologies, Inc., a New York-based development shop with an early adopter philosophy toward new technologies.

Childless, they are drifting apart--he breaking under the weight of the work of the farm, she crumbling from loneliness and despair. In a moment of levity during the season's first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning, the snow child is gone--but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness. As Jack and Mabel struggle to understand this child who could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale, they come to love her as their own daughter. But in this beautiful, violent place things are rarely as they appear, and what they eventually learn about Faina will transform all of them.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club\/events\/229932059\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":5400000,"name":"April Book Club - The Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey","id":"229932059","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461286150000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1315347100000,"name":"NYC Girl Geek Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":2444702,"urlname":"NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"39 West 56th Street ","name":"Floating Lotus","lon":-73.976372,"id":24501334,"state":"NY","lat":40.763355,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.16848349571,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461210414000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Full Moon &amp; Earth Day Healing Ceremony - with Vegan Chocolate &amp; Magical Tonics!<\/p> <p>NOTE: New location!

If you're coming in person please arrive at Madison Wellness by 7pm (THE DOOR WILL BE LOCKED AT 7:30PM) and pay when you arrive in cash or credit \/ debit card (don't use Paypal if you're coming in person). If you are on the distant list, the energy will run from 7:45pm - 8:45pm EST. There is no conference call or video feed for the distant session, simply lie or sit down in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed from 7:45pm - 8:45pm. PLEASE READ THE REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY (see below).<\/p> <p>We hope you can join us for this special discounted session, which falls on the day before <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthday.org\/earth-day\/\">Earth Day<\/a>. Earth day 2016 is also the day of the Full Moon in Scorpio. We'll align with the powerful transformational energies of the Full Moon and our ascending Mother Earth in this session to help the group connect more intimately with the heart of Mother Earth, thus enabling us to live more harmonically with the elemental energies and cycles of nature. Our physical bodies are lent to us by Mother Earth and we'll do some Spring cleaning and clearing on the physical form as well as enhancing the connection with Earth via the grounding cord. The grounding cord is a subtle energetic structure which extends from the root chakra down into the Earth. It plugs into the Earth and draws nourishing energy up into the body in the same way that a tree's roots draw up nourishment from the soil. When it is weak or broken, we become \"ungrounded\" - weak, spaced out, not present \/ partially disembodied.<\/p> <p><br\/>So to sum it up, the work we do in this session will ground us and connect our hearts with the heart of Mother Earth, clear the physical and auric field of obstructions to the free flow of life force, and enhance the embodiment of the immortal spirit into the physical form, thus enabling us to radiate more light!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Vortex Registration Instructions<br\/><\/b><br\/>In order to register, you must email me at [masked] stating that you are coming in person or that you want to be put on the distant list.

My ears filled with a ringing sound so loud and my heart was pounding seemingly out of my chest. I wanted the fear to stop. Then a waterfall of pure light fell over and through me and I calmed to a beautiful inner light. My ears are still ringing and I know that to be the angels singing!\" Beautiful! L.Z. (distant participant in California)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"Wow! I just wanted to thank you so much for last night's distant vortex session. It was one of the most powerful sessions I've had from you and Carol before and as you know I'm a regular, ha! The last 30 min I felt as if my heart was opening up to pure loving energy and it was indescribable.\"<br\/>Thank you so much,<br\/>S. B. (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"Amazing!!

(distant participant in Texas)<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"I must say that last nights session was very profound. It feels like everything has come together. I wasn't feeling great for a couple of weeks and I was losing faith and courage in all things. I was ready to ditch all spiritual pursuits. After last nights integration \/ harmonization session I feel invigorated and motivated again. Thanks to both of you for providing these sessions!\" KC - (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"I have gotten 3 distant group VortexHealing\u00ae sessions and I just wanted to say it is incredible how powerful it feels each time. Even the times I wasn't able to to fully concentrate and enjoy the experience, I felt such a sense of joy and upliftment wash over me when I was doing tasks and I knew this was real what I was experiencing. I suffer from depression and each session makes me feel like a child at my healthiest and happiest state, or as if I am on a very high dose of anti - depressants without the terrible side effects. It means so much to me and I just want to thank you so much - you truly have a gift!\" SB (distant participant in Toronto)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\"The session was fabulous, afterward I felt light as a feather.

I put through a \"tip\" for the session Thursday. It was very peaceful and deeply healing for me. I woke up yesterday and the virus I've been living with for the last 5 weeks had begun to clear.

He will describe hiking trails in such parks as Sterling Forest, Harriman State Park, Bear Mountain, Black Rock Forest,\u00a0Ramapo\u00a0Preserve, the Eastern Hudson Highlands, and\u00a0Mohonk Preserve. Peter will bring along his hiking equipment to show and discuss the ins and outs of back packs, hiking boots, hiking poles, ice crampons, snow shoes and appropriate outdoor clothing.<\/p> <p><br\/>Peter's presentation will cover details about a typical hike, how hikes are rated in terms of length and difficulty, what to bring along and how to use New York-New Jersey Trail Conference hiking maps. He will discuss the use of GPS devices to locate your position and how to relate these coordinates to the trail maps. The discussion will highlight the beauty of the woods and the tranquility that day hiking offers to those of us who lead busy lives.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0presentation will include a photo show of some of the beautiful mountain peaks in the area, the rivers and valleys and views from all four seasons of hiking. Following his presentation, Peter will answer your questions and tell you how to get started as a new hiker or someone with more experience. Overall, this will be a lively, interesting topic to get you thinking about hiking and enjoying the wonderful woods that surround our area.<\/p> <p>Starts at 7 pm at the Sloatsburg Library, 1 Liberty Rock Road, Sloatsburg, NY.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/5\/f\/600_437116223.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/9\/f\/600_441592383.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/b\/c\/600_441592412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/c\/9\/600_441592425.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/d\/2\/600_441592434.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/e\/4\/600_441592452.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>* \u00a0 * \u00a0 * \u00a0 * \u00a0 * \u00a0 *<\/p> <p>The <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hudsonhikers.org\/\">North Jersey Ramapo Chapter of the Adirondack Mountain Club<\/a><\/b>, an outdoor recreation and conservation group founded in 1922 in New York City, sponsors hikes of different levels and other events on weekends and Thursdays throughout the year.

Still very exciting!<\/p> <p>We have a new-old idea that leaps beyond the news hype and celebrates the wonder of the activity itself. Let's get together every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations. And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=224+West+4th+street%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10014%2C+us","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/230060253\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"duration":9000000,"name":"3D Thursdays! 3D PRINTING FASHION EVENT","id":"kggzmlyvgbcc","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461403205000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364936758000,"name":"fat cat FAB LAB","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":7890972,"urlname":"fat-cat-fab-lab","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pearl River","address_1":"275 E Central Ave","name":"Pearl River High School","lon":-74.004929,"id":23938113,"lat":41.059891,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.4691772461,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450215903000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Thursday's are for Tempo pace runs.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pearl-River-Track-Running-Meetup\/events\/230059781\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Tempo Workout","id":"kvjxmlyvgbcc","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461291977000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449704243000,"name":"Pearl River Track Running Meetup","group_lon":-74.0199966431,"id":19198608,"urlname":"Pearl-River-Track-Running-Meetup","group_lat":41.0600013733,"who":"To-Run-Ers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10009","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"10009","address_1":"E 6 ST & FDR DR","name":"East River Park Track","lon":-73.974739,"id":14312322,"state":"NY","lat":40.721565,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.12535595894,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458245437000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The East River Park track is east of the FDR at East 6th Street.

Still very exciting!\u00a0<\/p> <p>We have a new-old idea that leaps beyond the news hype and celebrates the wonder of the activity itself. Let's get together\u00a0every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations. And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together\u00a0sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"HOW TO GET IN TONIGHT:\nGo to 224 W4th St., off of 7th Ave, next to the Bank of America.

Unless we receive feedback on our speeches to know what our strengths and weaknesses are, we will not improve our communication and listening skills.<\/p> <p>In the club meeting, you practice giving prepared speeches as well as brief impromptu presentations (Table Topics). There is no rush and no pressure: The Toastmasters program allows you to progress at your own pace.<\/p> <p>Constructive evaluation is central to the Toastmasters philosophy. Receiving - and giving - such feedback is a great learning experience.

You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations. You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Floral-Park-Toastmasters-Club\/events\/230387214\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"General Toastmasters Club Meeting","id":"230387214","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461292071000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452653266000,"name":"Floral Park Toastmasters Club","group_lon":-73.7099990845,"id":19330309,"urlname":"Floral-Park-Toastmasters-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":12.0630092621,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460665451000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>this is our first meet and greet so come by and meet some friendly tech and design folks in your neighborhood<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queens-Code-design\/events\/230380054\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":5400000,"name":"code and design whatever is on your mind","id":"230380054","time":1461279600000,"updated":1461286166000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1456453944000,"name":"Queens Coders and Designers","group_lon":-73.7600021362,"id":19626869,"urlname":"Queens-Code-design","group_lat":40.75,"who":"shakers and movers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"500 8th Avenue","name":"Pearl Studios, 12th Floor","lon":-73.992393,"id":1537783,"state":"NY","lat":40.753044,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.245340690017,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453352766000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open House<br\/>3rd Thursday of the Month Once a month join Strictly Tango NYC for a very special Open House!

Harry is good\u2014humored about Carla\u2019s reappearance on his doorstep\u2014until he realizes that Carla, who spends her days soaking in the city, exploring Frida Kahlo\u2019s house, and learning Spanish, has no intention of leaving.<\/p> <p>When Harry and Carla\u2019s relationship of mutual tolerance reaches its inevitable end, she rejects his world of Anglo expats for her own set of friends: pretty-boy Oscar, who sells pot and dreams of being a DJ, and charismatic Memo, a left-wing, pseudo\u2013intellectual ladies\u2019 man. Determined to experience the real Mexico, Carla turns a blind eye to her new friends\u2019 inconsistencies. But then she catches the eye of a drug don, el Gordo, and from that moment on her life gets a lot more complicated, and she is forced to confront the irreparable consequences of her willful innocence.<\/p> <p>Jessica Abel\u2019s evocative black\u2013and\u2013white drawings and creative mix of English and Spanish bring Mexico City\u2019s past and present to life, unfurling Carla\u2019s dark history against the legacies of Burroughs and Kahlo. A story about the youthful desire to live an authentic life and the consequences of trusting easy answers,\u00a0<i>La Perdida<\/i>\u2013at once grounded in the particulars of life in Mexico and resonantly universal\u2013is a story about finding oneself by getting lost.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club\/events\/229717413\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"NBCBC #47: La Perdida by Jessica Abel","id":"229717413","time":1461281400000,"updated":1461293693000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334339313000,"name":"North Brooklyn Comic Book Club","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":3663112,"urlname":"North-Brooklyn-Comic-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Comic Geeks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hoboken","address_1":" 80 River Street","name":"Cadillac Cantina","lon":-74.029106,"id":23654005,"state":"NJ","lat":40.736389,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.25761890411,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458162628000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>RSVP Here<\/b>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njyp.org\/events\/thirsty-thursday-with-diageo-in-hoboken\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njyp.org\/events\/thirsty-thursday-with-diageo-in-hoboken<\/a><br\/><b>Buy Tix Here<\/b>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/thirsty-thursday-cadillac-cantina-hoboken-tickets-23197066049\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/thirsty-thursday-cadillac-cantina-hoboken-tickets-23197066049<\/a><\/p> <p>Event fee gives you a guaranteed good crowd to mix with in our reserved area, plus NJYP-only Drink and Food Specials:\u00a0<br\/><b>$5 basic cocktails:<\/b> Ketel One, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Don Julio, and Guinness<br\/><b>$8 specialty cocktails:\u00a0<br\/><\/b>Spiked Palmer\u00a0(Ketel Citroen, Sweet Tea, Club Soda, Garnish Lemon and Mint)<br\/>Ketel One Dirty Martini\u00a0(Dutch Mule, Ketel One, Ginger beer, lime juice)<br\/>Captains Punch\u00a0(Captain Morgan, Peach Schnapps, Cranberry, Pineapple)<br\/>Crown Royal Flush\u00a0(Crown Royal, Peach Schnapps, cranberry, Pineapple)<br\/>Crown Appletini\u00a0(Crown Royal apple, Sour Mix, Splash of Sprite)<br\/>Royal Old Fashioned\u00a0(Crown Royal, dash of bitters, simple syrup)<br\/>Jalapeno Spiced margarita\u00a0(Don Julio Blanco, Triple Sec, Lime Juice, Muddled Jalape\u00f1os, Splash of OJ)<br\/>Mexican Mule\u00a0(Don Julio, Ginger Beer, Jalape\u00f1os, Lime Juice)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Member Cost<\/b>: $5 online, $6 at the door<br\/><b>Non-Member Cost<\/b>: $6 online, $8 at the door<\/p> <p>Who can attend: Young professionals, single or married, who are 21-39 years of age.<\/p> <p><i>Note: Being in the MeetUp group does not make you an NJYP member.

The War was over and the bubbles were endlessly rising in the champagne.<\/p> <p>Ernest Hemingway\u2019s famous phrase was: \u201cIf you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.\u201d But Hemingway also knew that during the War, his generation witnessed more than its share of destruction and was ready for a clean and formal \u201ccall to order,\u201d as the architect Le Corbusier declared. From the wild rhapsodies of jazz and the experimental poetry of e.e. cummings to Corbusier\u2019s white-cube houses of Le Corbusier and the crisp outlines of Fernand Leger\u2019s still life painting, the dialectic of freedom and order played out in an era of unparalleled creativity.

Her unique approach to integrative healing fuses both the past and the future into a powerful vortex of presence, that is as revealing as it is enlightening.<br\/>More about her here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamanicgrace.com\/about\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.shamanicgrace.com\/about\/<\/a><\/p> <p>This new healing technique: the Language of Light activation, has taken Kerry many years to channel the information from a formless wordless reality.<\/p> <p>It is a beautiful healing script that any person can use to lead their family, friends, clients, and Self to align to their true nature. This workshop is suitable to all, regardless of spiritual practice or prior practitioner training.<\/p> <p>It helps bring forward one's Soul and Monad qualities, these qualities are our true natures and are what hold our destinies.<\/p> <p>The Monadic essence is an inseparable part of the whole of creation, a spark in the One Flame, a life within the One Life. It is the aspect that experiences no separateness, no limitations, and no failure. It is One with eternal bliss and joy, absolute love, and Divine Will. The Monad is pure Being for whom past and future have resolved themselves into the eternal Present. The Monad is that which is neither dual nor non-dual, neither form nor consciousness, and neither the creator nor the created. The Monad is one with the universal whole, and like that universe, is eternal and unceasing; it has no discernible beginning and has no definable end. The Monad is a citizen of the cosmos, a traveller among the stars, and journeys from one realm of existence to another, one solar system to another, and one constellation to another over countless, unimaginable ages of time. The Monad is the force of evolution itself, that strives ever onwards toward fuller expression. The Monad is that which is absolutely and eternally perfect within us, and when we connect up with it, that perfection manifests itself in all aspects of our lives.<\/p> <p>Language Of Light brings unconscious wisdom to the surface of our minds and gives us the opportunity to activate our destiny.<\/p> <p>With the Language of Light Alignment and Activation, you become the script. In this three day experience you will be given the script and energy tools to take home with you; you will be personally activated to use the script on yourself and others.<\/p> <p>Sacred sounds with be given to you to activate your Monadic field, your light bodies, and DNA. This sound will turn the energetic key to align you to your star seed within the star seed is the Language Of Unity.<\/p> <p>In these three days the feeling of Oneness returns to your energetic body, emotional body, physical body.<\/p> <p>We will restore our native soul tongue, a language not of words nor of the mind, it is perceived sensorially from our hearts, a unified language which empowers you within the Quantum presence.<\/p> <p>Language Of Light teaches you to recognize that each moment is a continuum of consciousness not subject to the past or future, and a knowing that our Soul\/Monad is continuously available in every instant.<\/p> <p>The \"Cellular Shaman\" will learn and embrace:<\/p> <p>* Western psychology versus Eastern psychology<br\/>* We will talk about Cyclical theory: Understanding the order of nature.<br\/>* Understanding of paradox: the idea of opposite<br\/>* The nervous system- sympathetic parasympathetic -And how they directly relate to the imbalance in all systems. Some imbalance come from chakras (store memory in the vibrational fields) which then works through the organs. This creates a reaction in the physical<br\/>* The way that you approach life or how others in life react to you is through the nervous system. All beings (human, animal, plant) in the natural world have an energy field, some of them are more complicated then others. Even the smallest of creatures have sensory perception. All of life is changing, growing, and birthing from these fields long before it moves into Matter. We will learn to fine tune our fields of perception.<\/p> <p>You will also learn:<br\/>* Cranial Tibetan pulsing.<br\/>* How to use and generate the field of electromagnetic energy with nature.<br\/>* How to unwind our DNA<br\/>* Using the spiritual energy laws of the Torus, Vortex and Vacuum, you will learn to enhance your healing tools by unifying and aligning our systems with the Monad.<\/p> <p>We will also look at the Seven Principles and how they affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.<br\/>The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy is based, are as follows:<br\/>1. The Principle of Mentalism.<br\/>2. The Principle of Correspondence.<br\/>3. The Principle of Vibration.<br\/>4. The Principle of Polarity.<br\/>5. The Principle of Rhythm.<br\/>6. The Principle of Cause and Effect.<br\/>7.

Suggested time is around 15-30 minutes, with 2 minutes for serves practice.<br\/>* <b>Teaming\/Pairing<\/b>: Players can pick their partners for the day. Ladies get a chance to make their choices first. Attempt is made to have balanced teams to have a good engaging tennis game.<br\/>* <b>Game<br\/><\/b>- We play 1 set and follow the standard rules of tennis.<br\/>- For first set \"First-Ball-In (FBI)\" so this ensures that at least you get your first serve in as courtesy by taking maximum 10 chances. It is only for the first set of the day. Subsequent sets start without any practice serves or first-ball-in.<br\/>- Sides are rotated on every odd number of games such as 1, 3, 5 etc.<br\/>- In case of 6-6, the set is settled through tie-break.<br\/>- The scores are to be spoken out loud by the server after every point, so that there is no confusion or conflict during or at the end of the game.<br\/>- If the court has counter to keep the set-score, it must be updated so that other players get to know the score to coordinate the switching smoothly.<br\/>* <b>After Set<\/b>:<br\/>- The winner pair stays together and they move \"up\" to play against the winners of next court. Move \"up\" means towards the higher ratings and move \"down\" means towards lower ratings.<br\/>- The loosing pair moves \"down\" and splits to form new team, hoping to find the winning combination.<br\/>- Ultimately there is one pair who stands out as the \"Champs of the day\" if no more challenger pair left. That is the official ending of the tennis day, though players can stay longer to play more among themselves.<\/p> <p>* <b>Social<\/b>: Depending on the mood and liking of the group, we can go out to eat, drink, and chit-chat somewhere close-by after the game.<\/p> <p><b>Miscellaneous other stuff<\/b>:<br\/>- Please bring a can of new \/ practice balls to play on hard courts.<br\/>- Players get tips by other players if they are open to improve their games.

You get a wide experience here- from the traditional eastern religions and philosophies to a modern sense of spirtuality and perception, and also a perfect blend of the two together. That sound snooty enough for you? All that aside, they have beautiful collections here, both ancient and modern art. Plus they have a trendy lounge with food, drinks, and a DJ. And you know what else? It's free- Yep, free, every Friday night from 6-10pm. You can't beat that- get some culture, get some food, and maybe get some groovin' to the music. For an added bonus, there's a happy hour from 6-7pm, 2-for-1 drink specials. They even allow us into the downstairs gallery while still enjoying our drinks. I don't know about you, but art appreciation seems a little easier with a drink in your hand.<\/p> <p>For those of you that won't be able to make it at 6pm, that's fine. The museum has a fairly simple layout and it shouldn't be too dificult to meet up when you get there.<\/p> <p>So the plan is: arrive when you can, enjoy the happy hour if you get there before it ends, check out some really interesting art, and do all that while getting to know some good people. Sounds like a great plan to me.<\/p> <p><i>A little about the Museum from their website:<\/i> The Rubin Museum of Art is home to a comprehensive collection of art from the Himalayas and surrounding regions. The artistic heritage of this vast and culturally varied area of the world remains relatively obscure. Through changing exhibitions and an array of engaging public programs, the museum offers opportunities to explore the artistic legacy of the Himalayan region and to appreciate its place in the context of world cultures.<\/p> <p>The museum's collection consists of paintings, sculptures, and textiles. Although works of art range in date over two millennia, most reflect major periods and schools of Himalayan art from the twelfth century onward.<\/p> <p>The exhibitions are organized with particular care to assist viewers who are new to Himalayan art. Wall texts and interpretive panels supply aesthetic, social, and historical perspectives to both scholars and casual viewers. The Explore Art Galleries on the third and fifth floors (with a video alcove on the sixth floor) take the viewer behind the scenes, answering questions about why and for whom the art was made. Books, paintings, photographs, artifacts, and computer terminals accessing the museum's website and affiliated sites offer other examples of Himalayan and related art.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/230365359\/","yes_rsvp_count":53,"name":"The Rubin Museum of Art","id":"230365359","time":1461362400000,"updated":1461515113000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"118 Greenwich Ave","name":"Rossopomodoro","lon":-74.002327,"id":23930858,"lat":40.738636,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":5,"distance":1.0185135603,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458749745000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's have a Friday night pizza night!!

Roy Neary (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/richard-dreyfuss-p88268\">Richard Dreyfuss<\/a>) is an electrical lineman who, while sent out on emergency repairs, witnesses an unidentified flying object, and even has a \"sunburn\" from its bright lights to prove it. Neary's wife and children are at first skeptical, then concerned, and eventually fearful, as Roy refuses to accept a \"logical\" explanation for what he saw and is prepared to give up his job, his home, and his family to pursue the \"truth\" about UFOs. Neary's obsession eventually puts him in contact with others who've had close encounters with alien spacecraft, including Jillian (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/melinda-dillon-p19211\">Melinda Dillon<\/a>), a single mother whose son disappeared during her UFO experience, and Claude Lacombe (celebrated French filmmaker\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/fran%C3%A7ois-truffaut-p114620\">Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut<\/a>), a French researcher who believes that we can use a musical language to communicate with alien visitors. Lacombe's theory is put to the test when a band of government researchers and underground UFO enthusiasts (including Neary) join for an exchange with alien visitors near Devil's Tower, Wyoming. In 1980, a \"Special Edition\" was released. While its primary selling point was the addition of scenes inside the alien spaceship, Spielberg claimed that he also cleaned up some choppy editing in the second act.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxp32VHaYdE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fxp32VHaYdE<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/230476183\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Close Encounters of The Third Kind Director's Cut 35mm film print movie at 7","id":"230476183","time":1461364200000,"updated":1461376545000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto -

He states:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>\"I do not cure anybody. God heals, and in his infinite goodness permits the Entities to heal and console my brothers. I am merely an instrument in God's divine hands\".<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Millions of people have consulted with John since 1965.[<i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed<\/a><\/i>] Up to 3,000 people per day stand and wait in line to see him individually.[<i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed<\/a><\/i>] He encourages research into his healing abilities in the hope that medical science can make use of his success in the treatment of humankind.[<i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed<\/a><\/i>] At the Casa de Dom In\u00e1cio, where treatments take place, John invites medical doctors to come onto the stage to observe his work.[<i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed<\/a><\/i>] He also regularly prescribes meditation and walks to a nearby waterfall as part of treatment. The Casa also sells herbs, blessed items and artefacts such as magic triangles. It was estimated by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/60_Minutes_%28Australian_TV_program%29\">60 Minutes Australia<\/a> in 2014 that these sales earn John over $10 million per year.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Deus_%28medium%29#cite_note-9Jumpin-9\">[9]<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>When called for a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychic_surgery\">spiritual surgery<\/a> by John, patients are offered the choice of 'visible' or 'invisible' operations. If they select an 'invisible' operation (or are younger than 18 or older than 52) they are directed to sit in a room and meditate. John also claims that spiritual physicians can perform surgery on the actual patient via a surrogate when the actual patient is unable to make the trip.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Deus_%28medium%29#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>A very small percentage of people choose a 'visible' operation where John operates without traditional anesthetic. Instead he says he uses \"energized\" mineral water and the spiritual energies present, the latter which are provided by groups of volunteers who meditate in a separate room called the 'current room'. These practices such as inserting scissors or forceps deep into a nose and scraping an eye without an anesthetic or antiseptics have been scrutinized by medical authorities and skeptical investigators.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>John tells people not to stop taking their medicine and says not everyone he serves will be cured. Often the treatment includes capsules containing pure <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Passion_flower\">passion flower<\/a> that are claimed to carry special blessed spiritual energy to support the individual's healing process.

Phone #[masked] Cell #[masked]<\/p> <p>In May 1921, the new musical Shuffle Along became the unlikeliest of hits, significantly altering the face of the Broadway musical as well as that of New York City. By the time Shuffle Along stumbled into town after a back-breaking pre-Broadway tour, it was deeply in debt and set to open at a remote Broadway house on West 63rd Street. In a season full of spectacles, such as Sally - a Ziegfeld musical - and another edition of George White\u2019s Scandals, Shuffle Along\u2019s failure was almost a foregone conclusion. New York City was still in the throes of the Depression of 1920. And despite being celebrated vaudeville performers, Miller and Lyles and Sissle and Blake had never performed on Broadway, much less written a musical. But with an infectious jazz score and exuberant dancing, Shuffle Along ignited not just Broadway but all of New York City. George Gershwin, Fanny Brice, Al Jolson, Langston Hughes, and famed critic George Jean Nathan were among the many fans who repeatedly flocked to West 63rd Street to see a cast which - during its run of 504 performances - featured such incipient luminaries as Josephine Baker, Paul Robeson, Florence Mills, Fredi Washington, and Adelaide Hall. Because of Shuffle Along, Uptown and Downtown met and became one.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-East-Coast-Travel-Meetup\/events\/225744915\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":44100000,"name":"Is Anyone Interested in seeing a Play In New York?","id":"225744915","time":1461406500000,"updated":1461475851000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421072491000,"name":"Baltimore East Coast Travel & Events Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":18326310,"urlname":"Baltimore-East-Coast-Travel-Meetup","group_lat":39.3499984741,"who":"East Coast Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"324 Grove St","name":"Clock @ Grove PATH","lon":-74.042641,"id":24182693,"state":"NJ","lat":40.719635,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.47082209587,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1418909483000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/d\/e\/event_143802462.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us at 7 am for a run to Liberty Park and back.<\/p> <p>We shall be back at 8 am to join the meetup after this one.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at Grove Plaza clock base (picture below)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/jcrunners\/events\/224426702\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Saturday run at 7 am from Grove Path","id":"wzgwllyvgbfc","time":1461409200000,"updated":1461421649000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1209393745000,"name":"Jersey City Road and Trail Running Meetup","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":1128237,"urlname":"jcrunners","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"JC Runners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Jamaica","address_1":"14732 Jamaica Ave","name":"Choices Women's Medical ","lon":-73.80666,"id":24421530,"state":"NY","lat":40.701584,"repinned":true},"headcount":0,"distance":11.435634613,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457715062000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey everyone!<\/p> <p>In collaboration with the National Organization for Women, MPofNYC will stand up against protesters trying to intimidate women from accessing health care outside of women\u2019s health clinics in NYC.

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, after school programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods programs to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/230534898\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":11700000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"230534898","time":1461415500000,"updated":1461428782000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Long Beach","address_1":"on the Long Beach Boardwalk in front of the Allegria Hotel","name":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Boardwalk,+Long+Beach,+NY+11561\/@40.584055,-73.6690273,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x89c27","lon":-73.657906,"id":24467417,"state":"NY","lat":40.588436,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.7182216644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459794007000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet on the boardwalk in front of the Allegria Hotel for a run together. \u00a0We will stay on the boardwalk for this run.\u00a0Also, if the weather is terrible then we will postpone our meetup. \u00a0I am a fair-weather runner :). \u00a0I am looking forward to meeting everyone!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be the ones wearing running shoes.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Long-Beach-Running-and-Exercise\/events\/230122067\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Let's meet at the Allegria Hotel on the boardwalk - National Blvd","id":"230122067","time":1461416400000,"updated":1461428847000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1459354806000,"name":"Long Beach Running and Exercise","group_lon":-73.6399993896,"id":19777664,"urlname":"Long-Beach-Running-and-Exercise","group_lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Runners!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459986652000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's that time of the year! Time to get outside and soak in some nice views and vitamin D and enjoy the fresh Spring air.<\/p> <p>Let's get off the beaten path and explore one of the less visited areas of the Hudson Highlands - Black Rock Forest.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/9\/8\/600_436983992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nBlack Rock Forest owes its name to the magnetite that was mined in this area in the 18th century. Although this natural preserve is located just across the road from the Storm King Park, it is often overlooked by the people in the hiking community...which means less crowded trails for us!<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/2\/f\/600_436983887.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe Hike:<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll do a 8-10 miles long loop, depending on trail and weather conditions. There is a network of developed hiking trails and gravel roads inside of the preserve, so we'll have some flexibility in choosing the exact route, but you can expect some steady moderate climbs\/descents with some shorter steep sections that may require light rock scrambling. About 3 hours into the hike, we'll take a lunch break, so please bring something to snack on. The entire hike with all breaks, at a decent pace, should not take more than 5-6 hours.<\/p> <p>Gear:<\/p> <p>Proper\u00a0footwear\u00a0is essential - a pair of\u00a0comfortable, broken-in shoes, with good\u00a0traction. Please no flip-flops, clogs, skate shoes and similar\u00a0footwear\u00a0on this hike.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bring enough water for the entire day. There is no potable water source anywhere along this hike, so come with your bottles\/hydration\u00a0packs filed up and\u00a0ready to go.<\/p> <p>You will need a small backpack to carry your food, water, and extra clothing. As I mentioned before, on some portions of this hike you may need to use your hands to climb up rocks, so you need your hands to be free.<\/p> <p>The weather in the early spring can be\u00a0unpredictable, and with a bit of a wind chill at the top of the hills along the way, a sunny day can turn into a cold one - so be ready and dress in layers. Bring an extra layer, a hat, \u00a0and rain\/wind jacket that can fit into your backpack.\u00a0A pair of gloves can be helpful on a cold, windy day.<\/p> <p>As on any given hike - it is always a good idea to have your own map of the area you are hiking. You can purchase NY\/NJ conference's West Hudson trail map pack - and bring map #113 with you, or at least print out this map as a backup:<\/p> <p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/blackrockforest.org\/files\/blackrock\/content\/MapNewLogo-EC.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/blackrockforest.org\/files\/blackrock\/content\/MapNewLogo-EC.pdf<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Sunblock and insect\u00a0repellents\u00a0are good to have handy.<\/p> <p>We should be done with this hike long before it gets dark, but it's always a good idea to pack a headlamp\/flashlight - for\u00a0unforeseen\u00a0circumstances.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/5\/6\/600_436983926.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nGetting there:<\/p> <p><br\/>We will carpool, and share the cost of gas\/tolls. Please use the comment field to offer\/ask for a ride.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Driving Directions\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>From NYC, take the Palisades Interstate Parkway to its northern terminus at the Bear Mountain Bridge and then continue north on U.S. 9W for about 10 miles to the parking lot on your left. Other option is to take Rt.4 to Rt.17 to I-87 to exit 17, then follow route 32 to Cornwall, take the southbound U.S. 9W, and arrive at the parking lot on your right, after about 1.7 miles. Or just enter the GPS coordinates into your GPS unit and let it lead you to the parking lot.<\/p> <p>GPS Coordinates:\u00a0[masked], [masked]<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/1\/9\/600_436411769.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nDISCLAIMER<\/p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities; per Meetup.com's Terms of Service Agreements, organizers and hike\/trip leaders are released from any and all forms of liability related to events.Full text of our liability waiver can be found on the following page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/events\/230184644\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Black Rock Forest Loop Day Hike","id":"230184644","time":1461416400000,"updated":1461826948000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1357706438000,"name":"Adventure Outlet","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6566782,"urlname":"Adventure-Outlet","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"45 Ave., 45 Rd. bet. 11 St. and 21 St. ","name":"John F.

(I count backwards!) In Part II we visited the High Bridge and then headed North. This time, Part I, we are going to visit the High Bridge from the South.<\/p> <p>Closed for some 40 years, the High Bridge recently opened up. It spans the Harlem River and connects Manhattan to the Bronx and was once used to bring water from the Croton Aqueduct to New York City. (The Manhattan Boro President said \u201cThis is almost the eighth wonder of the world\u201d and that is one great exaggeration but it is pretty cool to walk over it.) Before we visit the High Bridge we\u2019ll tour Riverside Park, we\u2019ll then see the the amazing Viaduct, \u00a0travel thru what was once the old village of Manhattanville and then we\u2019ll stop very briefly for lunch at Riverbank State Park. There will be some spectacular views of the Hudson River along the way. We will move at a fast pace but we\u2019ll stop for a very short while a number of times to talk about what we see. Much of the hike will be along the waterfront. In addition, right before we get to the High Bridge, we\u2019ll visit what was once the little village of Carmansville located in the West 150\u2019s and then we\u2019ll walk back and forth over the High Bridge. WE WILL THEN CLIMB UP ONE HUGE FLIGHT OF STAIRS-trust me this is the best way to do this for a number of reasons-and then we\u2019ll finish up at a subway station. THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF SURPRISES ON THIS ONE.<\/p> <p>BRING LUNCH AND WATER. NO FOOD STOPS TO BUY LUNCH. PLAN ON FINISHING BEFORE DINNER. (That means I\u2019m not sure when we will finish-maybe around 5 or so?!)<\/p> <p>We will meet BEFORE 10:30 A.M. to sign in. WE LEAVE PROMPTLY.<\/p> <p>Meeting place will be close to a subway.<\/p> <p>I bet you stopped reading by now-if not earlier! KEEP GOING-EXERT YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT.<\/p> <p>Please consider joining the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amc-ny.org\/<\/a> The Club offers many hikes, walks and events and is also active in conservation efforts and trail maintenance. Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup. Since this event will be posted as a last minute hike to AMC Club members, there is NO need for AMC club members to RSVP for this-unless you don\u2019t get last minute e-mails from Yahoo. (Contact me a few days before the hike if you are a dues paying AMC Club member and don\u2019t get these e-mails and I\u2019ll tell you how). Let\u2019s leave 10 spaces for AMC Meetup members.<\/p> <p>Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. SPACE IS LIMITED. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup event that I have led or are an abuser of the RSVP process\u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP. Let someone else go who will actually show up. SOME PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED OTHER AMC MEETUP EVENTS THAT I HAVE LED OR ORIGINALLY SIGNED UP FOR THIS EVENT ON APRIL 9. I ONLY KEEP A WAIT LIST FOR A SHORT TIME.<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 8:00 A.M. If there is no notice, we go. We will finish at the A subway station at 175 th Street.<\/p> <p>ON APRIL 30, I WILL BE LEADING A HIKE ON ROOSEVELT ISLAND DURING THE CHERRY BLOSSOM FESTIVAL.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-New-York-North-Jersey\/events\/230233241\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"The High Bridge from the South!

However, the Black Hole Complementarity hypothesis says that perhaps neither is violated and yet there are two very different quantum theories of black holes, one from an external perspective and one from an internal perspective, where these theories are dual and \"complementary\" to each other in the same sense that waves and particles were viewed by Bohr as dual and complementary to each other.<\/p> <p>suggested reference:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/hep-th\/9306069v2\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/hep-th\/9306069v2<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note:<br\/>The NY Quantum Theory Meetup group is most thankful to ThoughtWorks for gracefully allowing us to use their premises.

But if we look at the strength of kindness--the way it reminds us of a sense of inner abundance, the way it helps us feel connected to others instead of isolated and apart--we can appreciate kindness as the force it is. Kindness isn\u2019t an ally of foolishness or gullibility, but rather an ally of wisdom and courage.<\/p> <p>Sharon Salzberg<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis week we will look at Loving-Kindness and Compassion as they relate to our previous discussion of Aversion and Hatred.<\/p> <p>Last time we saw that our perceptions seem to tell us that the \u201cI\u201d we know as our self is separate and exists independently from\u00a0everything that isn't me. We often feel that things outside of our separate self are threats and require protective actions and those actions are often motivated by our anger or hatred of those external objects.<\/p> <p>In Buddhist teachings, this perceived separateness between \"me\" and \"other\" is considered to be a misperception or delusion that masks a deeper reality of unity or oneness and lack of separation. It is through direct experience of this universal oneness that the states of Loving-Kindness and Compassion arise naturally in us.<\/p> <p>In the Loving-Kindness practice we understand that just as we wish to be happy, healthy, safe and live with ease, so does every fellow being. Similarly, in the Compassion practice we cultivate an understanding that we all have suffering or dissatisfaction in life and wish an end to it for ourselves and other beings. The instructions for these two practices are simple, but living them directly and earnestly in meditation is what opens our hearts and awakens our minds.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

Let's continue getting April going by having another adventure with a wonderful trotting meetup. This one will be in the shimmering lights of Manehattan for all you local NY Bronies and also for those who like traveling in looking to see more of the Big Apple~!<\/p> <p>This go around we are going up to the tip of Manehattan: our lovely Washington Heights! It is named for Fort Washington, a fortification that had been constructed at the highest point of Manhattan by the Continental Army troops during the American Revolutionary War[masked]), as to defend the area from the British forces. We will be meeting at NY Penn station and from there taking the 1 train uptown to 157th street. There we will be starting our trot walking along side of the Trinity Cemetery (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_Church_Cemetery\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_Church_Cemetery<\/a>) to the Hudson River Greenway.<br\/>We will be working our way up north on the Greenway all the way to the Inwood Hill Park! (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inwood_Hill_Park\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inwood_Hill_Park<\/a>)<br\/>After completing the trot we will get down into a new local eatery to cool down, chat, relax, and regain our energy from our successful hike before we break off and say our farewells. No one is obligated to stay if they are scheduled to be somewhere else though ^^.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will leave 30 minutes, past the hour. So please get there EARLY!<br\/>NOTE: We will NOT be waiting on anyone past 12:30 PM. It is unfair for those who get here early, so please plan to get here early. If you will be late, please Un-RSVP from the event, catching up with the rest of the group would be neigh impossible.<\/p> <p>Notice about necessary fare: For use, the NYC subway will cost $2.75 per ride.<\/p> <p>It is important to keep well hydrated. Bringing along some bottled water is advisable. There is some water fountains in the parks, but the first option is highly recommended, this time.<br\/>Other recommendations would be possibly a light snack if you get a munchies moment while on the hike, also a small towel.<br\/>Any other questions or recommendations, please let us know in the comments! Phone number will be posted on the morning of the Meetup. We look forward to seeing every pony again! ^^<\/p> <p>MORE INFORMATION WILL BE COMING SOON!!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bronies-NYC\/events\/229427166\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Trotting Crusaders of NYC","id":"229427166","time":1461427200000,"updated":1461887377000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1327525494000,"name":"Bronies-NYC","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3168022,"urlname":"Bronies-NYC","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Ponies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"968 3rd Avenue","name":"Capital One 360 Cafe","lon":-73.967415,"id":24397781,"state":"NY","lat":40.760952,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":1.40620195866,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458444481000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Surviving as an artist in the modern age is tricky.

We yearn for likeminded budding and established women who want to have fun (cocktails) but also those that want to create and inspire each other with passionate projects and events.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Hence why we started a networking group called #girlBOSSnyc. We are a social network of empowered and inspired NYC women supporting community, careers and each other. Our goal is to have monthly passion and purpose filled events that cultivate friendship and conversation amongst other ladies who are really busy like us. Most of the women in our networking group are writers, bloggers, PR execs, fashion, film, art, and music young professionals.

If you have never heard of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thesavemovement\/\">The Save Movement<\/a>, it started with Toronto Pig Save back in December 2010 when a woman named Anita Krajnc noticed trucks of frightened pigs being transported to a nearby slaughterhouse. By July 2011, three vigils were held each week for pigs, chickens, and cows.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/0\/e\/600_448998958.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>I had the opportunity to visit Toronto this month and was able to attend each one of the vigils. It is difficult to describe this experience, but it was one that forever changed me. It is one thing to hear about animal suffering and watch videos documenting it, but being present with these sentient beings while they are experiencing immense pain and trauma is entirely another and reinforces the reality that this injustice is truly an everyday occurrence. It made the situation that much more urgent and gave me motivation to fight even harder for animals.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/1\/e\/600_448998974.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We found out about NY Farm Animal Save and decided it would be great to attend their events and provide support! Their monthly vigil is held outside La Granja Live Poultry. The main purpose of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/936880719760172\/\">event<\/a> is to bear witness to the animals, document the conditions they are in, and educate the public about veganism. The Animal Save Movement utilizes a love-based approach inspired by Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/2\/e\/600_448998990.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There is also a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njfarmanimalsave\/\">NJ Farm Animal Save<\/a>, and we would like to attend their next event, so keep an eye out for that!

Let's enjoy spring together through beautiful Riverdale\u00a0;<\/p> <p>Starting with marble Hill, a very peculiar neighborhood which used to be a bump on the northern tip of Manhattan but it is now attached to the Bronx (the local area code is 718 -Bronx-) but residents still vote in Manhattan. The name comes from the Inwood marble that starts cropping there...<\/p> <p>From here, we will walk along the scenic \u00ab\u00a0Palisade avenue\u00a0\u00bb towards Wave Hill and we will encounter many beautiful houses and mansions protected by an ancien forest, facing the Hudson.<\/p> <p>The high of the walk will be in Wave Hill, which used to be the former residence of Mark Twain and now is a botanical garden overlooking the Hudson River.<\/p> <p>Superbe\u00a0!<\/p> <p>Riverdale covers about three square miles in area. It has one of the highest\u00a0elevation in New York City, affording it views of the Empire State bd, George Washington Bridge, Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades.<\/p> <p>NOTICE THAT\u00a0:<\/p> <p>-Bring water, sun protection (maybe?), and comfortable walking shoes.<\/p> <p>-The Wave Hill admission fee is $8 Adults, $4 Students and Seniors 65+<\/p> <p>-This walk is about\u00a07 miles and moderate paced. You don't have to walk on the Palisade avenue to Wave Hill, you can leave from 231st if you want after visiting Marble Hill.<\/p> <p>-The meeting\u00a0time is (before lunch) at 1:00 PM.<\/p> <p>DIRECTIONS\u00a0?<\/p> <p>Public Transportation by Metro-North:\u00a0 Take the No. 1 subway train to\u00a0Marble Hill\/225th Street.<\/p> <p>For the way back, we will get a one way Metro-North train ticket from Riverdale to several other stations, including Grand Central Terminal, 125th Street in Harlem.\u00a0If you\u00a0take the train to Grand Central Terminal, the fare will be higher than taking the train to Yankee Stadium or 125th Street in Harlem for instance. The fare depends on the zone. ..<\/p> <p>We can try to buy a ticket at the Marble Hill station's vending machine before starting the walk. That will save us time. And purchasing a regular fare ticket on board the train is\u00a0considerably more expensive.<\/p> <p>-IMPORTANT\u00a0: Before the walk, there are few places where you can have access to restrooms. There are NO restrooms available on the Palisade avenue.\u00a0Later on, restrooms will be available at Wave Hill.<\/p> <p>-If you are registered for this walk and can't attend, just please change your RSVP online from \"YES\" to \"NO\".\u00a0There is no need to post why you can't make the event.

The current Greek Revival church building was built in 1836.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/4\/b\/600_446150507.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe parish also opened the first Catholic school in the US in 1800. It was home to famous early parishioners like St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, who converted to Catholicism here in 1805, and the Venerable Pierre Toussaint, a former slave who became a great 19th-century philanthropist. The French Holy Cross fathers who founded the University of Notre Dame celebrated Mass here the day after they arrived in the US in 1841, on their way to South Bend, Indiana.<\/p> <p>The Venerable Father Felix Varela was a priest here in the early 1800s. Mother Adelaide O'Sullivan of St. Theresa, a Carmelite missionary,\u00a0was baptized here. Not all the parishioners were saints. Old West outlaw Billy the Kid (Henry McCarty) was baptized here as well.<\/p> <p>More recently, the late Father Mychal Judge was laid before the altar of St. Peter's by firefighters who recovered his body from the World Trade Center on 9\/11. The church itself suffered minor damage from the terrorist attacks when part of the landing gear from one of the planes hit its roof.<\/p> <p>St. Peter's is renowned for its works of art, including Jose Vallejo's The Crucifixion, which remains above the main altar ever since it was gifted to the church by the Archbishop of Mexico City in 1789.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/3\/c\/600_446150748.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Mass at 4 p.m., feel free to arrive early to explore (the church is open 24\/7) during the Year of Mercy).

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty-five years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

Why in the world would you want to hike in the dark? With your vision reduced your other senses become hyper aware and you'll experience the forest in a whole new way. You'll be able to smell and hear that bear about to eat you rather than just see him!<\/p> <p>We're going to have a nocturnal adventure at Harriman State Park, one of my favorite local playgrounds. Starting at the Reeves Visitor Center trailheads in the Southern section of the park, we'll trek through the forest along the Seven Hills trail, follow a bubbling brook for a bit, then trek through the forest and ascend to a westward-facing\u00a0 rocky plateau overlooking the Hudson Valley. Here we will stop for a while and enjoy what should be a beautiful sunset.<\/p> <p><br\/>After the sun goes down, we'll trek a bit further and descend the mountainside to our next destination, Pine Meadow Lake. We'll hang out lakeside for a bit under the full moon, enjoying the stars and serenity of night, and if the mood strikes -- and we can find dry wood -- we'll make a campfire to toast some marshmallows and other fireside goodies.<\/p> <p><br\/>A little heads up, if you are afraid of things that go bump in the night then you might want to sit this hike out.<\/p> <p><b>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your organizer is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.

You don't need to be a world-class athlete to participate, but you need to be in decent physical shape.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0This is a <b>social<\/b> hike, the pace will be moderate. If you yearn to channel your inner Mountain Goat and feel the need to race everyone to the top of the mountain, this is not the hiking trip for you.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dress in layers of non-cotton clothing -- remember it is chillier at night, wear hiking boots or trail shoes (I wouldn't recommend sneakers but that is at your discretion), a hat, bring 2-3 liters of fluid, a packed dinner and\/or snacks, and insect repellent. Also pack a pocket poncho in case of showers.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Bring a headlamp and spare batteries. You may want to bring an additional handheld flashlight as well.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Heavy rain cancels the hike.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I will distribute my mobile phone number to the confirmed RSVPs.<\/p> <p><i><b>How To Get There ... Carpool!<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i>There is no mass transit option for this hike so drivers are needed.<\/i><\/p> <p>Take NJ Route 17 north to the New York State Thruway and take the first exit, Exit 15A (Sloatsburg). Turn left at the bottom of the ramp onto N.Y. Route 17 north, and continue through the Village of Sloatsburg. Just past the village, turn right at the traffic light, following the sign for Harriman State Park. Cross an overpass over railroad tracks and continue along the Seven Lakes Drive, passing under the Thruway overpass, and soon entering Harriman State Park. Proceed for another mile to the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center, on the right side of the road. Park in the Visitor Center's parking lot (SEE PHOTO BELOW). If the lot is full, parking is allowed in certain roadside areas.<\/p> <p>Please post if you are driving and can pick up passengers (how many and from where). If you need a ride, please be proactive and contact a driver directly. Passengers, as a courtesy you should chip in for gas, tolls, and coffee for the driver.<\/p> <p><i><b><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/6\/event_53935222.jpeg\" \/><\/b><\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/229045028\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Not So Urban Athletics: Sunset and Full Moon Night Hike in Harriman State Park","id":"229045028","time":1461448800000,"updated":1462076172000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11366","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"NY","address_1":"301 W 51st St","address_2":"upstairs","lon":-73.985684,"phone":"212-541-7080","name":"House of Brews","id":806417,"state":"NY","lat":40.76293,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.923350870609,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459694560000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Online dating is great.

Why in the world would you want to hike in the dark? With your vision reduced your other senses become hyper aware and you'll experience the forest in a whole new way. You'll be able to smell and hear that bear about to eat you rather than just see him!<\/p> <p>We're going to have a nocturnal adventure at Harriman State Park, one of my favorite local playgrounds. Starting at the Reeves Visitor Center trailheads in the Southern section of the park, we'll trek through the forest along the Seven Hills trail, follow a bubbling brook for a bit, then trek through the forest and ascend to a westward-facing\u00a0 rocky plateau overlooking the Hudson Valley. Here we will stop for a while and enjoy what should be a beautiful sunset.<\/p> <p>After the sun goes down, we'll trek a bit further and descend the mountainside to our next destination, Pine Meadow Lake. We'll hang out lakeside for a bit under the full moon, enjoying the stars and serenity of night, and if the mood strikes -- and we can find dry wood -- we'll make a campfire to toast some marshmallows and other fireside goodies.<\/p> <p>A little heads up, if you are afraid of things that go bump in the night then you might want to sit this hike out.<\/p> <p><b>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your organizer is in the running for hardest working person on meetup. While everyone else is running in the other direction, I'll be the first one to jump in front of that bear when he tries to eat you.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Important Stuff ...<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is going to be an <b>INTERMEDIATE<\/b> hike of about 8 miles and expect to be in the forest until about midnight. You don't need to be a world-class athlete to participate, but you need to be in decent physical shape.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a social hike, the pace will be moderate. If you yearn to channel your inner Mountain Goat and feel the need to race everyone to the top of the mountain, this is not the hiking trip for you.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dress in layers of non-cotton clothing -- remember it is chillier at night, wear hiking boots or trail shoes (I wouldn't recommend sneakers but that is at your discretion), a hat, bring 2-3 liters of fluid, a packed dinner and\/or snacks, and insect repellent. Also pack a pocket poncho in case of showers.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Bring a headlamp and spare batteries. You may want to bring an additional handheld flashlight as well.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Heavy rain cancels the hike.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I will distribute my mobile phone number to the confirmed RSVPs.<\/p> <p><b>How To Get There ... Carpool!<\/b><\/p> <p>There is no mass transit option for this hike so drivers are needed.<\/p> <p>Take NJ Route 17 north to the New York State Thruway and take the first exit, Exit 15A (Sloatsburg). Turn left at the bottom of the ramp onto N.Y. Route 17 north, and continue through the Village of Sloatsburg. Just past the village, turn right at the traffic light, following the sign for Harriman State Park. Cross an overpass over railroad tracks and continue along the Seven Lakes Drive, passing under the Thruway overpass, and soon entering Harriman State Park. Proceed for another mile to the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center, on the right side of the road. Park in the Visitor Center's parking lot (SEE PHOTO BELOW). If the lot is full, parking is allowed in certain roadside areas.<\/p> <p>Please post if you are driving and can pick up passengers (how many and from where). If you need a ride, please be proactive and contact a driver directly. Passengers, as a courtesy you should chip in for gas, tolls, and coffee for the driver.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/6\/event_53935222.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Chill-Hiking-Camping-Meetup\/events\/229045641\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Not So Urban Athletics: Sunset and Full Moon Night Hike in Harriman State Park","id":"229045641","time":1461448800000,"updated":1462119424000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1348679858000,"name":"NYC Chill Hiking, Camping, and Other Activities","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":5118552,"urlname":"NYC-Chill-Hiking-Camping-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11205","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"497 DEKALB AVENUE ","lon":-73.957067,"phone":"3475292617","name":"Brooklyn Nights ","id":1100994,"state":"NY","lat":40.690912,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.44083547592,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458604572000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Steppers we'll be at the NEW BROOKLYN NIGHTS. \u00a0Come to Brooklyn to eat, drink, learn, and dance Chicago Style Steppin' at Brooklyn Nights! \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>They have new management, decor, kitchen, and Bar! \u00a0Menu is below. \u00a0We're excited about the new spot as it changes things up. \u00a0As always, the soul food goes with the best soul music-- R&amp;B, Neo-Soul, Funk, Hip-Hop, classics.<\/p> <p>Brooklyn Nights<\/p> <p>497 Dekalb Ave, Brooklyn, NY (right down the street from Rustik Tavern)<\/p> <p>(Train: G to Classon Ave- 2 blocks)\u00a0<\/p> <p>Time: 6-10p;\u00a0Lesson: \u00a06-7p ($10);\u00a0Open dance after: $5 (Free w\/ Lesson) but SUPPORT the kitchen and bar.<\/p> <p>*The BEST Instruction in Chi Step. \u00a0Beginners, new friends are are lways welcome! \u00a0No Partner Necessary!<\/p> <p><b>*Special: Click RSVP so we begin to reflect actual attendance, and we will enter you each time for a drawing of a Free volume of our Steppers Music CDs or Free Class\/ Admission!\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>MENU ITEMS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Buffalo Wings,\u00a0French Fries,\u00a0Tater Tots,\u00a0Fried Kosher Dill Pickles,\u00a0Cajun Style Popcorn Shrimp \u00a0(gluten free), Pork, Chicken, and fish\u00a0Tacos,\u00a0Super Salads, Caribbean Caesar Salad,\u00a0Pulled Pork Sandwiches,\u00a0Grill Chicken Sanwiches, Grilled chicken, pulled pork, and Fish cake Sliders, Brooklyn Fish and Chips, B.B.Q.

Trained by her mother, Viji Prakash, in Bharata Natyam dance, she is now mentored by India\u2019s acclaimed master Malavika Sarukkai. Mythili\u2019s use of traditional Bharata Natyam technique and extended repertoire creates new structures that awaken the physicality, musicality, and theatricality of the art form.
