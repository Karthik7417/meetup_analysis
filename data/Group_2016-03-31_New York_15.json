All nationalities are welcome.\n\nWhat can you expect? Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 30-40 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Baby Sign Language lets babies, as young as six months old communicate their needs so they don't need to cry as often. Your baby will learn how to tell you when she is hungry, wants more, or is all done; if he is too cold or too hot, or if she just needs a hug. Studies reveal that babies who sign begin speaking earlier and have a larger vocabulary than their non-signing peers. I started this group because I wanted to empower my baby girl to express herself through signing and because I could find no classes in our local area. Packing baby up to take her into the City or into Bergen County was not something that I wanted to do on a regular basis. Instead, I've created a network of instructors who will travel to us to provide classes. Classes are fun and interactive as babies and their parents learn signing through song and music. We will meet at local (Hudson County) libraries and community centers.<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/highres_447266739.jpeg","photo_id":447266739,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/600_447266739.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/thumb_447266739.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200531712,"name":"Deborah Hines","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/highres_254274848.jpeg","photo_id":254274848,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/member_254274848.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/thumb_254274848.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"Hudson County Baby Signers","id":19633124,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Hudson-County-Baby-Signers","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Parents of Baby Signers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Beach","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456592362000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"environment","name":"Environment","id":89},{"urlkey":"alternativeenergy","name":"Alternative Energy","id":1980},{"urlkey":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","id":15998},{"urlkey":"environmental-activism","name":"Environmental Activism","id":18721},{"urlkey":"environmental-awareness","name":"Environmental Awareness","id":23842},{"urlkey":"save-widlife","name":"Save Widlife","id":450102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Surfrider-Central-LI-Chapter\/","rating":0,"description":"The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to the the protection and enjoyment of oceans, waves and beaches through a powerful activist network.

Please respect your fellow members. Any inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and person with the inappropriate behavior will be kicked out of the group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT OUR CLIMBING EVENTS<\/strong>: Rock climbing provides a full-body workout that tests the mind as much as it does the body -- and also happens to be a lot of FUN and ADDICTIVE. There are more opportunities to do it than ever before, too, with several indoor facilities that cater to the vertical workout popping up throughout the city over the past five years. We will do climbs at Brooklyn Boulders in Queens and Brooklyn, as well as at The Cliffs in LIC. No worries if you are new to rock climbing. It's very easy to learn as long as you are open to adventures. We will practice and learn together on our way to becoming ROCK STARS.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to indoor climbing, we will on occasions do outdoor rock climbing as well as ice climbing up in the Shawangunk or the Catskills regions.<\/p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT OUR HIKES<\/strong>: We subscribe to the premise that hiking should be a fun, leisurely experience. It\u2019s NOT about how fast you can hike. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to chase after. Hiking is about taking the time to savor the sights and sounds of nature. It\u2019s about enjoying each other\u2019s company, get to know each other, while on the trails and perhaps even hug some trees along the trails. We will keep at a leisurely pace on our hikes, with plenty of stops for catching our breaths, having refreshments, and taking in all the Kodak moments. Everyone will go at their own pace, with no fear of being left behind.<\/p>\n<p><strong> PLEASE, NO SPEED DEMONS<\/strong>. If you want to go fast, there are plenty of other hiking groups on Meetup that can accommodate your need for speed. All our hikes will be on weekends within the NY\/NJ area, many of which hikes will be serviced by public transportation. Occasionally we\u2019ll do hikes where we\u2019d have to carpool to get there.<\/p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT OTHER ADVENTURES WE WILL PARTAKE IN:<\/strong> Ziplining, skiing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, travelling to places near and far, wine tasting, skydiving \u2026 or even just plain eating out, enjoying a meal together \u2026 the possibilities are ENDLESS.<\/p>\n<p><strong> WHO SHOULD JOIN THIS GROUP: <\/strong>Singles of all ages who like to hike at leisurely pace, rock climbers of all skill levels and\/or just anyone with a sense of adventure and a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and try new things. Please leave the drama and crankiness at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong> MEETUP FEE<\/strong>: It is FREE to join a Meetup group. However, each group\u2019s Organizer does pay a fee to Meetup HQ to keep the site up and running. Meetup Organizers have the option to charge a minimal fee to help defray the monthly Meetup cost. Therefore, a $1.00 Meetup fee will be collected at randomly selected events. Our organizers DO NOT make any profit from running this group.<\/p>\n<p><strong> IMPORTANT GROUP RULES<\/strong>: A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group. It is about the quality of members in the group! We would rather have a small group of \"quality members\" than a huge group of \"joiners\" and \u201clurkers\u201d who never show up to any event.<\/p>\n<p> With that said:<\/p>\n<p> (1) To join the group, you must have a recognizable face picture; <\/p>\n<p> (2) Being a member in the group, you don\u2019t have to attend every event on the calendar, but try to participate in at least 1 event every few months. If you are a general lurker who join the group but not participate in any event, please don\u2019t bother to join.<\/p>\n<p><strong> General rsvp policy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> Yes rsvps ONLY if you are serious about attending an event. No need to rsvp if not attending.<\/p>\n<p> We will enforce a strict ANTI-FLAKE POLICY - Just one (1) no-show or last minute (less than 24 hours) cancel will get you booted out of the group.<\/p>\n<p> If you are an RSVP-aholic, that is, you rsvp to every single event and then bail out last minute, you do not belong in this group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/highres_447379414.jpeg","photo_id":447379414,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/600_447379414.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/d\/6\/thumb_447379414.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":95422062,"name":"Admin","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/highres_245379865.jpeg","photo_id":245379865,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/member_245379865.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/b\/9\/thumb_245379865.jpeg"}},"members":199,"name":"Climbing, Hiking, Adventures & Outdoors for Singles (CHAOS)","id":19639871,"state":"NY","urlname":"chaos-nyc","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"CHAOS-tics"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456713037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy","name":"Stand Up Comedy","id":29712},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"comedians","name":"comedians","id":52161},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"standup-comedy","name":"standup comedy","id":108531},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Laugh-Lounge-Comedy-Show-at-the-Velvet-Lounge-Brooklyn\/","rating":0,"description":"Bring the Funny!

Our goal is to provide a space for professional women from a diverse range of disciplines can relax unwind and network with peers in a collaborative and rewarding environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>While the group is mainly geared towards women, we aren't in this alone; men make up the other half of the equation and as such, men who support women's empowerment are critical allies and are welcome to bring a fresh perspective from a male p.o.v. to the group. A sample of the important areas of focus for the group include the following: <br><\/p>\n<p>Business Ideas and Strategies to Maximize Success. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you've got it all figured out and want to share, or are struggling along, this group formulates ideas and strategies to move you to the next level your career. <br><\/p>\n<p>Interpersonal Relationships and Communication <br><\/p>\n<p>Balancing work and relationships is a challenge every successful business woman must master. Here women share their experiences and strategies for having a rewarding personal life outside of the boardroom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Women's Leadership and Political Representation <br><\/p>\n<p>Representation in the business and political worlds is key to the successful integration of women into the decision-making fabric of our society. Business women explore the means for effective representation in an ever changing world. <br><\/p>\n<p>Children and Career <br><\/p>\n<p>So, we've met all the deadlines, closed the latest deal, or negotiated a jaw-dropping settlement in a lawsuit. What now? This group effectively explores and provides solutions to effectively manage our maternal instincts, with work life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Overcoming Fear of Failure <br><\/p>\n<p>\"Courage allows the successful woman to fail and learn powerful lessons, from the failure. So that in the end, she didn't fail at all.\" -Maya Angelou<\/p>\n<p> Studies show [1], a major inhibitor of success among women, much more so than men, is fear of failure. But why fear failure, when you can mine it for gems that will help you to become even more successful than you would have been without this bump in the road? This group examines the rules of engagement when facing failures. We discuss these teaching moments as phenomenal launching pads to coming back stronger and more successful than ever. <br><\/p>\n<p>Beyond our member-driven seminars and workshops, we also take time to bond and enjoy the wider world. Whether dressing up and having a night on the town or planning an adventurous excursion, anything can happen when women put their minds to it. Come join us and make friendships which will last a lifetime. <br><\/p>\n<p>[1] Clifford, Catherine. \"Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.\" Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.

It was part of a publication known then (and to this day) as \"Mix To Go Magazine.\" \"Massive\" was created to promote the coming together of New Yorkers for parties, social events, travel-oriented events related to music (like a ski weekend, Caribbean cruise or music festival) and the like. The group grew quickly from just a NYC chapter to chapters in Miami, Vegas and Atlanta...then just as quickly its founder \"got busy living\" and shut down the meetups. But \"Mix To Go Massive\" kept going and growing; it is still a very active Facebook group of over 5,000 members (www.facebook.com\/groups\/mixtogo). The return of \"Mix To Go Massive\" to Meetup is to create a NEW atmosphere of fun and excitement for people who like to go out and dance, socialize and hear good music. Most genres are represented musically but the four most requested are top 40\/open format (a little of everything popular in a great DJ mix), EDM Parties (think Pacha and Webster Hall...MINUS those venues; no disrespect if you like them!!), house music (there are a few splits genre-wise...especially during the summer when endless outdoor parties take place)...and Caribbean events (especially if you hang out in Brooklyn). \"Mix To Go Massive\" founder Freedom hosts seven (7) events weekly with additional \"one-offs\" such as yacht parties, 1 day cruises and holiday events...and in 2017 there will be a seasonal travel-oriented event. Join the movement IF you plan to be an active member (this is one of the reasons the groups were disbanded before). Bring friends, make suggestions and attend our weekly \"town hall meetings\" where we discuss the \"business of having fun\" in New York City: Suggestions are made by members, ideas are presented to the group and \"secret\" events and VIP-only events are announced to the most active members. In addition to the Facebook page and now this meetup site you can follow the daily posts on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr @djfreedomlives as well as @djfreedomglobal (over 7,000 followers there). See you in the (social) mix!

I created this group because while many people understand that there is a connection between their environmental space and their mental space, they do not know how to integrate or change their spaces to generate more positive energy flow in their lives. We will discuss various topics including, but not limited to, personal energy and space and it's effect, ways to enhance personal strengths and minimize weaknesses, working smoothly through life transitions, belief and empowerment, learning to let go, and forgiveness as a tool for self growth. Meetings will be held in Ramsey, NJ and on the Upper West Side in Manhattan.

When the yogi and dancer in us meet the interplay of their energies gives birth to a theater fueled not by their search for stardom, but by their quest for the betterment of humanity. The ultimate purpose of this yoga class is to prepare practitioners to develop a discipline and daily yoga practice in order to exercise introspection, build self-awareness and ultimately achieve growth. \"Knowing love, I will allow all things to come and go, to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage. Life is right in any case. My heart is as open as the sky.\" About Sylvie Bayeux Being a multifaceted woman Sylvie sees her self foremost as an Educator. She has been a religious yoga practitioner throughout her entire artistic career in theater and dance, developing her own personal practice based on Iyenger, Ashtanga and Multiversal schools of yoga. Teaching yoga to dancers, athletes and neophytes she helps them achieve strength, flexibility, and balance. Yet most importantly she guides them through a life-transforming experience, that of freeing their power within. Sylvie walks the path of yoga daily, as woman, dancer and artist, sharing her yoga knowledge through what she considers to be her dearest art form, the Art of Teaching.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200863933,"name":"Sylvie Bayeux","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/highres_254443135.jpeg","photo_id":254443135,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/member_254443135.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/thumb_254443135.jpeg"}},"members":51,"name":"Midtown East Yoga & Dance","id":19659610,"state":"NY","urlname":"Midtown-East-Yoga-Dance","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Yoga Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457108011000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"modern-architecture-and-design","name":"Modern Architecture and Design","id":38050},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"residential-real-estate-development","name":"Residential Real Estate Development","id":95710},{"urlkey":"architects-and-interior-designers","name":"architects and interior designers","id":699492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCArchitects-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all architects!

We all know the creative world is a beast and being alone in this world is just not the path you should take. Becoming a fashion designer is my ultimate career goal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/6\/d\/600_447515437.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>However I do not come with an impressive, extensive formal fashion background, I did not attend Parson or the Elite Saint Martins. But I have a God given talent that exudes my entirety. It is the definition of who I am. The one thing that keeps me happy no matter my circumstances. It is the first thing I think about every morning and every night before I go to sleep. However I find myself standing alone in my passion, not being surrounded by a strong network of creative people who share similar interest. While I have been to many places and have met many influential people, still I find myself standing alone in my vision. Never truly making that connection.&nbsp;<span>Therefore I find myself asking these questions without getting much of an answer\u2026 Most people will tell you, go to the Internet, ask Google! However as smart as Google maybe getting the facts or the support from someone who have truly stand or have walked in your shoe is priceless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;Networking is a major contributor to success: Hence here I am, standing alone in my vision and now I invite you to stand with me in yours. Help me build a network of forward thinking, creative, informative but always fabulous, support system. Lets help each other achieve our goals little bit quicker. This group is only open to active, creative, driven individuals. All things beautiful include but not limited to: Fashion Designers, Interior Designers, Fashion Stylist, Hairstylist, Makeup Artist, Photographers, Bloggers, Writers, PR personals.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/0\/f\/highres_447517135.jpeg","photo_id":447517135,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/0\/f\/600_447517135.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/0\/f\/thumb_447517135.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":200966359,"name":"Celeste Matthews","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/4\/c\/highres_254494124.jpeg","photo_id":254494124,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/4\/c\/member_254494124.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/5\/4\/c\/thumb_254494124.jpeg"}},"members":10,"name":"Creative Socials","id":19667143,"state":"NY","urlname":"creativesocials","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457220432000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"addiction","name":"Addiction","id":2734},{"urlkey":"alcoholism","name":"Alcoholism","id":6783},{"urlkey":"nondrinker","name":"Alcohol-Free","id":7174},{"urlkey":"recovery-and-fellowship","name":"Recovery and Fellowship","id":15136},{"urlkey":"support-and-recovery","name":"Support and Recovery","id":17966},{"urlkey":"sober","name":"Sober","id":26144},{"urlkey":"sobriety","name":"Sobriety","id":46198},{"urlkey":"alcohol-and-drug-free","name":"Alcohol and Drug Free","id":68373}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Support-and-Recovery-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Disclaimer: David Hantman is the administrator and not an active member nor involved in recovery. &nbsp;I am administering this site for Ellie Little who is involved in recovery. &nbsp;This is her page. &nbsp;I wish you all success on your journey. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are offering an alternative to AA for anyone who had difficulty with it or felt somehow evil and toxic because of it. And this is not simply for those struggling with substance abuse problems but I promise you are not alone.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>That's why I created: <br>The giant leap! for the other 83%: <br>Did u know that AA and NA programs only help 17% of addicts for whom alcohol is not their main drug of choice? I tried it and frankly it seemed like the more I tried to serve their god the more it felt like I was the butt of the big guy's joke. That is why I have made this giant leap for the other 83% of mankind who were made to feel somehow defective because of AA <br>1 acknowledge that u r not powerless I mean u dragged ur ass to this meeting right? U r trying to take control of ur life so commend urself for that <br>2 write down every craving u have and I guarantee u will find them to be fewer and further between. Also write down everything u have tried in the past to get sober and everything u will do differently. Notice how much prouder u already feel&nbsp; <br>3 if step two is hard because the last thing u wanna do when u have a craving is sit and stew in it, reach out for help. Real friends will be happy to help <br>4 try and remember a time when u knew urself and imagine urself at that age and what pure joys made u happy. Whatever it may be I guarantee u will involuntarily smile <br>5 through the reflection and meditation of step four u should be capable of finding the strength and power within urself: the strength that brought ur ass to this meeting and will hopefully prepare u for the next step <br>6 it is true that u will have to make amends to someone I mean lets be real but u may not always get the response u want so for every apology u make remind urself of something good u have done too even if that good thing is simply getting sober! <br>7 this one is a little tricky granted but will definitely help: think back to when u were a child and try to remember anything u were obsessed with whether it was a boy girl food or the idea of being popular. If u realize that the disease effected u before u encountered the drug then the next step will not be easy <br>8 by this point things in ur life that were once easy have now become incredibly hard, if they weren't then u would not be an addict. So while the main person u should be doing this for is u there are I'm sure other people in ur life or whom u would like back in ur life that u wish to be stronger for. Just think about them <br>9 confront those people and tell them U want to help them but u may need their help too. If u don't get the response u want remember step6 but the positive feedback is certain to keep u going at least for a while <br>10 by now the pressure of everyone accepting u again is building and you want to trip over ur own foot so u have no one else to blame. At this point return to steps 1,3&amp;4 even simultaneously. Remember that power inside urself? It may feel dim but it cannot be snuffed out. After all ur still alive right?&nbsp; <br>I'll admit I cannot promise that this alone will make me happy but I can tell u it gave me the hope of a happy future. My name is Ellie. And I am an addict <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3330981,"name":"David Hantman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/highres_251120955.jpeg","photo_id":251120955,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/member_251120955.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/1\/d\/b\/thumb_251120955.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"New York Support and Recovery Meetup","id":19667587,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Support-and-Recovery-Meetup","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457220511000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"directors","name":"Directors","id":21003},{"urlkey":"film-production","name":"Film Production","id":26681},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"film-makers","name":"Filmmaking","id":31082},{"urlkey":"filmmakers-screenwriters-other-film-crew","name":"Filmmakers, Screenwriters & Other Film Crew","id":38598},{"urlkey":"meeting-filmmakers-producers-agents","name":"Meeting Filmmakers, Producers, Agents","id":44095},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"grip","name":"Grip","id":86715},{"urlkey":"gaffer","name":"Gaffer","id":86717},{"urlkey":"director-of-photography","name":"Director of Photography","id":86718},{"urlkey":"writers-and-aspiring-writers","name":"Writers and Aspiring Writers","id":163796},{"urlkey":"the-film-crew","name":"The Film Crew","id":216241}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/film-crew-collaborators\/","rating":0,"description":"Film Crew Collaborators NYC is a group for filmmakers.

Do you do booty calls? Do you have a friend with benefits situation you are considering? Well, let me tell you about this awesome group!<\/p>\n<p>This group is for singles (especially women) who have woken up from the Disney fantasy you have been sold and are looking for more logical, sensible and fun relationships. Marriage is great and all but finding a life partner is no small task and you are NOT getting any younger. Maybe you have given up or maybe you still looking but in the meantime, you have a desire for some kind of physical intimacy. You can find somebody in this group or use this group as a support network to help you find somebody. Let's also share ideas and talk about ways to make non-traditional relationships work. How do you avoid getting hurt? How can you be safe? What about dealing with societal issues like women being shamed for having casual relationship? Is there a wrong way and right way to make it work? Let's meet up and do something fun as we talk about things in a safe environment where you don't have to worry about being judged. <br> <br>Although all daters are welcome, this group is more for confident daters who probably could do well with traditional dating if they so chose, but that is not their goal. The daters in this group should ideally not have problems attracting \"good people\" to date, it's just it's more about not finding what THEY want. Like with myself, if I just wanted a traditional girlfriend, I'd have no problem. The problem comes only with finding a woman who I actually want that with. The non-traditional dating options come in with what I do in the meanwhile until I find what I want for the long term.<\/p>\n<p>So ultimately this group is not really about attracting a partner but rather figuring out how to make non-traditional dating options work. It's about once you already find the partner you seek, how does it all work? We are open to discussing all kinds of options from non-sexual type relationships, OGBC, FWB, XWSEX,&nbsp; Cougar or whatever works for YOU, with the one exception of cheating. If that is your thing, that is on you, but this group cannot support you with that.<\/p>","lon":-74.0800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/highres_447741966.jpeg","photo_id":447741966,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/600_447741966.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/thumb_447741966.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":201053631,"name":"Carl","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/highres_254538105.jpeg","photo_id":254538105,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/member_254538105.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/thumb_254538105.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Hasbrouck Heights to hell with tradional Dating Meetup","id":19673746,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Hasbrouck-Heights-to-hell-with-tradional-Dating-Meetup","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Dating Rebels"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Forest Hills","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457345866000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pingpong","name":"Ping Pong","id":3262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Ping-Pong-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Want to play some recreational ping pong, join us at a club here in Forest Hills!

Recently, with improvements in hi-tech tools in cognitive neuroscience, such as EEG and fMRI devices, we can see brain activity better and more clearly than ever before. In addition, with affordable technologies such as tablets, smartphones, Google Glass, etc., we can design more individualized learning media.\n\nDetermining how each student learns based on cognitive neuroscience and designing digital media for learning based on educational theories will lead to success in more students\u2019 learning. Current teaching methods are only targeting a specific group of students; however, we need more individualized learning. We are losing many talents along the way due to our poor understanding of how people learn and our inability to adjust instruction to meet each student\u2019s particular need. \n\nThis group aims to contribute to the study of mind, brain, technology and education to identify individual differences among students, create learning design principles for designing more individualized digital learning media and techniques to improve students\u2019 learning capacity. We believe the social environment affects learning as much as genetics, and we believe each student has their limitations and strengths. It is our mission to encourage students to take advantage of their strengths and to work with them to improve their limitations. \n\nThis group welcomes Cognitive Neuroscientists, Technologists, Educators and any person who is interested in using cognitive neuroscience to improve digital media design for learning.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":101942542,"name":"Aybuke","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/highres_253811800.jpeg","photo_id":253811800,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/member_253811800.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/e\/1\/8\/thumb_253811800.jpeg"}},"members":94,"name":"Mind,

The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative is a series of individual learning events focused on leadership topics that are relevant to both work and personal life. Each leadership development event features a guest speaker with a deep level of expertise on a relevant topic, along with facilitated dialogue and exercises that help participants to apply knowledge to life and work. OPERATING PRINCIPLES 1. We seek to Democratize Leadership Development We believe great development opportunities should be available to anyone, anywhere. The cost however, in both time and money, can be prohibitive for many people to participate. This is especially true for individuals on a limited budget, small business owners, individual realtors and consultants, government officials, and those engaged in non-profit organizations. For people in for-profit business organizations, our offerings will complement your in- house training at a very competitive fee. To help democratize leadership development, our fees will always be reasonable, and based on the presenter's fee and costs for each event. Plus, we will allow you to self- select lower fees, if needed. We even offer a fee where you can choose to attend in exchange for performing a good deed. It will be that easy to afford! 2. Knowledge is an expense, while Applied Knowledge is development and an investment. As an example, take the simple transaction of purchasing a self-help or business book, ideally at your local bookstore. You finish reading the book, but you do not find any content meaningful to you and, as a result, you do not apply any of the content. We would suggest the purchase of this book is an expense. In another instance, you purchase and complete a different self-help or business book, you find the content relevant and, as a result, apply the content and it improves an aspect of your life\/work. This purchase can be characterized as an investment, as you received a return on your investment of the cost of this book. follow up with coaching or peer group meetings. 3. We will always do our Good Deed! In the spirit of creating meaningful change in the world, The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative will donate the net proceeds of each learning event to designated organizations that have a clear purpose of positively contributing to their community.","lon":-74.2699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201100640,"name":"John Harvey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/highres_254563924.jpeg","photo_id":254563924,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/member_254563924.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/thumb_254563924.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative","id":19677729,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Maplewood-Leadership-Development-Initiative","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Particpants"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edgewater","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457405339000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"sound-therapy-healing","name":"Sound Therapy & Healing","id":25952},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"gong-sound-bath-meditation","name":"GONG SOUND BATH MEDITATION","id":293601},{"urlkey":"healing-with-sacred-sounds","name":"HEALING WITH SACRED SOUNDS","id":293651},{"urlkey":"gongs-tibetan-singing-bowls-crystal-bowls","name":"Gongs.

All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

If you are interested in helping organizing events, that'll be great and please let me know so I can make you an organizer. Apart from diner and happy-hour, we will also do various activities such as hiking, picnic and book club. Please feel free to suggest any event on this site even if you are not an organizer.

I hope by joining this group, you can find useful information about NYC and have fun experiences, and make meaningful connection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Apart from being respectful to each other, there is only one rule for this group: if you sign up for an event but can't make it, please change your event status. If you don't, you will have a No-Show record. After having 3 No-Shows, you will loose your membership to this group. This is because some events will have limited spots, so by holding the spot, other people who can make it otherwise will not be able to. In addition, without knowing you are not coming, the group will wait for you, which is inconvenient. On a related note, if you are late, please also let the event-organizer know.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, since I'm paying membership fees of 19 dollars month by month to host this group, each meet-up event will be charged for 1 dollar and you can pay when you come to the event.

This group will consist of the most active members - therefore members who are inactive for months at a time will be removed&nbsp;&nbsp;(while understanding that some time off before\/after the birth of your baby is necessary!)<\/p>\n<p>3. This group will follow proper etiquette - please do not be a 'no show' (let us know if something comes up!) or cancel too often at the last minute (especially if we have reservations\/a wait-list for an event), etc. &nbsp;Understanding that life is (or is about to be) super hectic, just reach out and keep us in the loop of what's going on!<\/p>\n<p>Following these 'rules' will help vet the most active members and allow us to build meaningful friendships and a support system as we all aim to figure this mommy-thing out! &nbsp;;)<\/p>\n<p>Thanks ladies - looking forward to meeting you soon!<\/p>","lon":-74.3099975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/3\/d\/highres_447675421.jpeg","photo_id":447675421,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/3\/d\/600_447675421.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/3\/d\/thumb_447675421.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":144325962,"name":"Stephanie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/f\/a\/6\/highres_213709062.jpeg","photo_id":213709062,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/f\/a\/6\/member_213709062.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/f\/a\/6\/thumb_213709062.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Cranford-Area Pregnant Ladies\/New Moms!","id":19685987,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Cranford-Area-Pregnant-Ladies-New-Moms","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"mommas"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457554699000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"feminism","name":"Feminism","id":312},{"urlkey":"socialism","name":"Socialism","id":1665},{"urlkey":"marxism","name":"Marxism","id":2307},{"urlkey":"civilrights","name":"Civil Rights","id":3508},{"urlkey":"black-women","name":"Black Women","id":18634},{"urlkey":"political-activism","name":"Political Activism","id":19690},{"urlkey":"revolution","name":"Revolution","id":19844},{"urlkey":"african-american","name":"African Americans","id":35203},{"urlkey":"black-men","name":"Black Men","id":35666},{"urlkey":"african-american-history","name":"AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY","id":83993}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Reading-Circle-Revolutionary-Integration\/","rating":0,"description":"Revolutionary Integration: A Marxist Analysis of African American Liberation What will it take to truly end racism in the U.S.?

In this powerful and comprehensive professional two-day training, you will receive everything you need to become a confident and successful Shamanic Reiki I practioner. You will learn to harness this powerful healing energy and channel it to yourself and others. Becoming a Reiki practioner opens energy channels in the body and the spirit. This can lead to deep and profound changes in your quality of life, sense of self, and your ability to manifest. Not to mention giving yourself a holistic way to work with your own physical challenges. Even after a Reiki I training, students often experience a heightened sense of intuition and even psychic sense. Life direction can become clearer, as well as a heightened ability to hold love in a deeper way. Reiki teaches us to align with our innate compassion and goodness, and opens us to new possibilities. Finally, in Reiki, the \u2018healer is made\u2019. We are all healers, and Reiki is said to lie dormant in our DNA, waiting for us to excavate it and use it for the benefit of others and the world. The following will be covered in this SHAMANIC REIKI I class: - Historical background of Traditional Usui Reiki - In depth definition of what Reiki is and what it can do - Shamanic journeying for healing - The hand positions to treat self and others - Working with plants and stones - Energetic extraction and Soul Healing - The Reiki I Attunement Ceremony - The alchemy of healing - Reiki ethics - Using Reiki to cure specific conditions (physical and emotional) - Using Reiki to empower your goals - The energy body (the Aura)and the Chakras - You will learn to do administer a full Reiki treatment - A detailed reiki manual - A certificate of completion - Lots of love and personal attention REIKI, as defined by the International Center for Reiki Training Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by the \u201claying on of hands\u201d and is based on the idea that an unseen \u201clife force energy\u201d flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means \u201cGod\u2019s Wisdom or the Higher Power\u201d and Ki which is \u201clife force energy.\u201d So Reiki is actually \u201cspiritually guided life force energy.\u201d In a Reiki class, one receives a Reiki \u2018attunement\u2019 \u2014 the Reiki Master facilitates a transference of universal life force energy to the student. The student is then able to work with Reiki energy at will.

We are excited to announce that we have scheduled our <b>Kick-Off Meeting for April 11th from 10am-12pm;<\/b> you may already RSVP if you are planning on attending. We will then have our <b>first 2-3 mile walk as a group at Little Bay Park on April 18th at 10am<\/b>. Our spring schedule is complete and we will be adding meet ups to our group calendar shortly.<\/p> \n<p>Now for a little background on your <b>group organizers, Larissa and Debra.<\/b> We are Personal Wellness Coaches as well as Independent Product Distributors for Herbalife. Our goal, up until now, was to simply reach as many people as we could (between our full time Mommy positions) and assist our clients on their personal journeys; health, fitness and nutrition were the focal points of our coaching. While this is still something we love to do, we have learned a few things along the way of our own journeys.<\/p> \n<p><b>Social\/Group Walking<\/b> has been proven to work on many levels. The one that stood out most for us was the community aspect. The fields of fitness and nutrition need a community of like minded people to be there to support one another. When you set out to make a lifestyle change, you need a cheering section and someone to help you up when you stumble. Change can be scary, so having others to offer their experiences, knowledge and accomplishments is a great way to keep your confidence and momentum going. While some are able to achieve success without a community standing behind them, difficulties may emerge, weight will be put back on, meal planning and prepping will no longer be enjoyable, and suddenly, many find themselves right back where they started.<\/p> \n<p><b>We are hoping for a large variety of excited participants from different backgrounds, decades, generations and cultures.<\/b> The individuals that we believe will benefit most from our vision are simply those who believe in the benefits of exercising with a group. <b>Walking, in particular, is a low impact form of exercise that mostly everyone can do on a regular basis. <\/b>We are not looking to conduct high intensity classes, or incorporate weights and other fitness apparatus that would make it difficult to focus on our main objectives of fitness and socialization. Members, you are invited to bring your children, strollers, and babies. Pet parents, your dogs are also welcomed. We see each and every one of you as a valuable member of our growing community and we will not place restrictions on members when at all possible.<\/p> \n<p>It is important to us that our members understand that we are a social walking group and our visions and goals are geared towards creating a community based on the common interest of leading healthier, more active lifestyles. While we may incorporate Herbalife into some of our Meet ups, <b>our main objective is to create our community of Whitestone Walking Warriors<\/b> <b>and make it something we can all be proud of. Members will never be required to take part in Herbalife in order to continue with our Meet ups. <\/b>Herbalife taught us one of the most valuable lessons in the health and fitness field: a community is essential. A strong, active, committed community knows no bounds when it comes to supporting one another on their personal wellness journeys.<\/p> \n<p>We are really looking forward to putting our plan into action!

I am looking to start running some friendly games again sometime in the future and I thought i'll start here to gather some network of players and build a community. Games will be available whenever I can get enough players at any given time of any given day. So far, most of the network consists of Asians (some that are still learning the game lol) so it will be big ++ if you can speak some chinese or don't mind other players speaking that (off course will be kept minimum and monitored to prevent any form of unfairness). Games will consist mostly of 1\/2 or 2\/5 no limit holdem games, nothing too big but who knows, might even get some other games in!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Lets built a nice local community and maybe we can even get to know each other better and do some ac trips in the future :) If you are a poker player or interested and within the Brooklyn area, you should join.

Because we truly want to be all-encompassing, there will be a mix of itineraries with destinations both domestic and international, various accommodation levels and price point, active and leisure itineraries, etc. Also, some trips will be joining larger groups and some will be private tours just for us. &nbsp;Although our main objective is to create itineraries for a mixed group of member, there will be occasional trips that will have a specific demographic focus (i.e. men or women only).<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for upcoming meetups where we can discuss current trips and ideas for the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Look forward to hearing from you and hope you join us one one of our up coming trips!....LET'S SEE THE WORLD TOGETHER!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please contact us with any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Best regards,<\/p>\n<p>Aurelio<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/highres_447935450.jpeg","photo_id":447935450,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/600_447935450.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/thumb_447935450.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185213487,"name":"Aurelio","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/highres_251806829.jpeg","photo_id":251806829,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/member_251806829.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/thumb_251806829.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Rainbow Travelers Network","id":19718659,"state":"NY","urlname":"Rainbow-Travelers-Network","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Rainbow Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Maywood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458164792000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beekeeping","name":"Beekeeping","id":1993},{"urlkey":"honey","name":"Honey","id":58132},{"urlkey":"bees","name":"Bees","id":64759},{"urlkey":"urban-beekeeping","name":"Urban Beekeeping","id":75094},{"urlkey":"community-beekeeping","name":"Community Beekeeping","id":75095},{"urlkey":"keeping-your-honey-bees-healthy","name":"Keeping your Honey Bees Healthy","id":83603},{"urlkey":"meeting-local-beekeepers","name":"Meeting Local Beekeepers","id":83604},{"urlkey":"bee-keeping","name":"Bee keeping","id":148173},{"urlkey":"honeybees","name":"honeybees","id":304401},{"urlkey":"beekeeping-basics","name":"Beekeeping Basics","id":625042}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maywood-Meetup-for-local-beekeepers-meet-n-2-work-together\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Looking for local beekeepers who want to work together on keeping our hives healthy.

How you define yourself often limits you to playing a role, rather than developing an expanding sense of purpose. The truth is, these are simply our roles in society, not who we truly are. What happens when we attach ourselves to these roles too much? Attachment to our roles leads to overwhelming expectations, self-judgment, negative thoughts and beliefs. We can have expectations of attaining the perfect version of whatever role we are in, have fears of vulnerability, and judge ourselves harshly. We can become plagued with self-doubt: Am I smart enough? Am I good enough? Our thoughts and beliefs lead to our perceptions about the world and ourselves. It is as if we have blinders on which we seem to have no choice and a limited view on everything. Because of this, we are disconnected from others and ourselves. Success and happiness seem unreachable. How can we live a life where we honor who we really are, make conscious choices unaffected by misconceptions, and create the success and happiness we want? Mission: Transcend Group Coaching is a network of individuals that are on the journey to understand themselves better and create deep connection to others by supporting each other in living passionate and authentic lives. Through releasing these attachments to our roles, we can live more authentically, honoring who we truly are, and enjoying every moment. Together this group will support each other in reducing unrealistic societal, familial, and personal expectations. We will break through barriers we have created with in ourselves for years and live more in the present moment. We will reduce fear and judgment while increasing happiness, success, and connection. Imagine this new you at a crowded party, talking to someone you are attracted to; at a work event; or an awkward family gathering, having the confidence to connect with people in new ways, having meaningful conversation, and engaging with others like never before. In this group you will release self-doubt, fear, loneliness, and insecurities, and replace it with confidence, courage, and a support network to live a connected, conscious, and aware life. In my coaching practice, I have been recognized for my ability to ask thought-provoking questions to help individuals and groups dig deeper into exploring who they are and what is important to them. With monthly conference phone calls, an online community forum, weekly discussion questions, and individually defined actions steps, I will help create an environment of support, motivation, and inspiration. We will break down physical, mental, and spiritual barriers that have gotten in the way of connecting with others and ourselves. The fact is that everyone has challenges, limiting beliefs, assumptions and judgments about themselves and the world. Together we will embrace our challenges, understand our desires, and live our purpose\u2026 Get ready to Transcend! The Benefits of Conference Calls for Group Coaching As we connect with people around us we are drawn to similarities. We are attracted to people that look like us, have similar clothing or other outward traits. These superficial characteristics can either create connection with people or stop us from getting to know them. It is common to put more weight on these superficial characteristics of people but the reality is that it can keep us from getting to know them in deeper ways. Through group phone conversation, we will transcend physical superficial barriers and focus instead on the energy, values, and beliefs of each person. It will help create a new way of being. With this new awareness, we will honor what makes us all unique, truly learning from each other and growing together.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201707330,"name":"Carson Cooper","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/highres_254861845.jpeg","photo_id":254861845,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/member_254861845.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/thumb_254861845.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"New York Transcend Group Coaching","id":19724076,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Transcend-Group-Coaching","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Transcenders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458263503000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"politicalcafe","name":"Political Cafe","id":3334},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"critical-thinking","name":"Critical Thinking","id":15544},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-socials","name":"Coffee and Tea Socials","id":18105},{"urlkey":"vote","name":"Vote","id":19278},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"elections","name":"Elections","id":40198},{"urlkey":"national-politics","name":"National Politics","id":112476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversation-Group-Lets-Talk-About-Trump\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>***THIS IS NOT A PRO OR ANTI TRUMP GROUP.

Each monthly meetup will be in formal setting where we will be divided into groups of 5-10 to discuss a series of specific topics covered in the media around Trump's rise and eminent nomination or brokered\/open convention. We will change groups with each topic, to mix things up and get to know other people and points of view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is NOT a Trump event. This is not meant to support, or denounce Trump or any political party.

Tired of clicking \"submit\" to hundreds of online applications and not receiving any responses? Do the pixels on your computer screen seem to be moving because you've been staring at it for so long? This group is designed for those that are unemployed and looking for a career or those that are looking to transition careers. Family and friends can provide only so much support, but I found the most comfort in people who were in the same situation as myself. The goal is to provide you with free professional development advice and strategy to help you in your career search. Whether you're a new graduate looking for your first career or a tenured professional looking to transition, all are welcome. Additionally, if you are in a neighboring area (Hoboken), feel free to attend. I believe that anyone who joins this group has something to offer, you may not know it yet. There are so many online resources to help with your job search that it can be overwhelming. I would like to put it out there that there are multiple opinions on how to handle job searching and these are just my own. Find what works best for you and try new avenues if what you're doing isn't working. I am starting this group because I want to help give others more opportunities to succeed in their job search. I know firsthand that unemployment\/career transition can leave you feeling a little lost and in need of some direction. All suggestions are welcome - interview prep, resume critique, professional dress, rolling over your 401k from a previous employer without penalty or taxes, etc. I realize that working in a team is better than working alone. If you are a professional that is looking to contribute back to your community, please let me know and we can meetup and find ways to make this group more effective.

Distinctions among genres, and between genre and literary fiction, have become irrelevant. Once, Kurt Vonnegut angrily denied that he wrote science fiction; now, the New Yorker gives it an entire issue. And Henry James scorned historical fiction as \"essentially impossible,\" which would surprise Hilary Mantel. Our program will address craft issues common to fiction in all its forms, whether mainstream or cross-genre. Our first day is a master class led by award-winning authors whose work explores the boundaries of literary, speculative, and historical fiction. On the next, you'll discuss your own and fellow writers' work in small groups. Our faculty are nationally known writers as well as experienced and accessible teachers. John Crowley's Little, Big won the World Fantasy Award and was nominated for the American Book Award. He has also received the Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He has taught creative writing at Yale since 1993. Louis Bayard is the author of Roosevelt's Beast and Mr. Timothy and teaches at George Washington University. He also wrote the New York Times' weekly recap of Downtown Abbey.

This type living is one of the greatest networking opportunities you can ever experience; many of us have been doing beach shares for several years and have become life long friends. If you love the beach and love being around like minded people, this could be an opportunity for you. The group shares a beautiful 6 bedroom house in beautiful Sea Girt, NJ that is a mere 1 block to the beach and 1 block from the popular Parker House bar\/restaurant. This is by far the nicest house and most conveniently located still available for this type rental. If you live in the city or Hoboken, as many that spend the summer in this town are, there is mass transit that can take you back and forth so many spend SUnday night and do the direct morning commute into work.

We take a 'no pressure' and 'no force' approach to our trips where we offer our people to be a part of BornWild without the pressure of educational talks on wild animals, nor do our travellers need to have a strong interest in Wild Animals. All we ask is for you to come along, have fun, meet new people and enjoy the social gathering. BornWild is different, as the profits we make, we donate a generous donation to wild animal charities. Our chosen charity of the season is WildCRU.org and they are supporting our every step, thats what makes us different to the rest. Not only will you have an amazing time with us, you'll be helping make the world a better place too.

I'm Carrie Pink, Your Financial Stylist, and I love teaching overspenders, impulse buyers and shop-a-holics how to take control of their personal finances. I do this by showing you how to blur the lines between frugal and fabulous in your closets and wallets so you can stop spending and start building wealth. Since 2002 I have been teaching financial literacy and since 2007 I have been providing financial tips and tricks on my blog www.carriepink.com.

A little more info:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 &nbsp;The group meets every other Monday at 7pm in the Columbus Circle\/Upper West Sideish area. If you cannot regularly attend, this group unfortunately won't be a good fit. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 We keep the group to 6-8 people in order to make sure that everybody can regularly get feedback. As mentioned, everybody is in their 20s and 30s and we would like to keep it that group dynamic. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Work is posted ahead of time on a Google Groups page. The rule is, if you would like to post your work, you have to have given feedback to the people the previous meeting. Fair is fair. This is to prevent people who only show up when it's their turn to get critiques. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Variety of genres are welcome. If you have an erotic Ted Cruz fanfic, that might be a little too weird for us, but we are otherwise pretty open. You get different perspectives and idea.

I would like to create a support group for those of you out there who might be going through some anxiety, health problems, or both (they often come hand in hand), and are having trouble finding support among the people you know. It can be tough finding the right emotional support and\/or advice you need that will help you through the difficult times. And it might be nice to connect with others who are going through something similar. Lets get together, share stories, and offer patience and kindness to each other. Lets create a safe place to talk, give and receive support, and maybe laugh too :) I'd love to have Meetups in relaxing settings where we can comfortably get to know each other and also enjoy our surroundings in peace.

Dennis is a Holistic Health and Fitness Coach, as well as a Crossfit Level 1 trainer. He is HUGE into sports, fitness, healthy eating, preventing diseases, gut health and an incredible inspiration to our family, friends, his clients and mostly myself. I grew up passionate about dancing, painting, being outdoors in nature but for over 10 years, I have been challenged with ADHD problems and smoking addiction, which caused me to steer away form myself and from what I love. Upon meeting Dennis, I had the strong desire to change but I always felt like I was alone in my journey. Now, after almost 2 years I have been enjoying a much fresher side of life, mainly because I discovered that unhealthy habits, loneliness and depression can be best cured through movement, through being outdoors, connecting with nature and mainly through sharing this experience with other people. I love Dennis' approach to exercise and fitness, not because he is my husband, but because he is extremely creative in making workouts fun, playful, unique in such a way that while you sweat all the 'bad' stuff, you gain some great laughs with your team mates. This is something I feel like is missing in the \"gym\" world and wanted to bring it out to you too, because I know it helps, because I know you will love it too and because you will want to start moving not because you have to but because you want to. We began this type of group training, while living in New Zealand. It felt so refreshing that we decided to bring it to you too, here in New York, so you can also experience a Fresh New Day. The Hoops are excited to meet you!","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193794179,"name":"Iva","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/c\/highres_255220620.jpeg","photo_id":255220620,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/c\/member_255220620.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/e\/a\/c\/thumb_255220620.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Fresh New Day","id":19777602,"state":"NY","urlname":"Fresh-New-Day","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Fresh Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Oceanside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459354806000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"triathlon","name":"Triathlon","id":1155},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"trail-running","name":"Trail Running","id":16301},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Long-Beach-Running-and-Exercise\/","rating":0,"description":"Want to meet to run on the boardwalk or beach?
