But one of those Keys has just resurfaced and numerous factions are dead-set on possessing it. This means certain doom for the poor souls who've stumbled upon it.<\/p> <p>Are these unfortunate souls mere pawns in a greater game? Do they even know of that which fate has cast their way?<\/p> <p>If they are truly unaware of the significance of that which they now possess, it would be to their benefit to become aware of it. Fate and destiny have converged upon them and, before long, many will vie to possess the item they hold. Many will seek to become the Keeper of the Keys and our intrepid adventurers stand in their way.<\/p> <p>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I am looking to run this campaign as part of the Edison MeetUp group. However, I cannot run\/attend a weekly game. My schedule simply does not allow for it.<\/p> <p>So I'm setting this group up as a bi-weekly game; sort-of. Specifically, I will schedule a recurring MeetUp for the first and third Monday of each month beginning with February 15th, 2016. I will also schedule a bonus MeetUp for the fifth Monday of those months that have five Mondays. This means our first four meetings will be February 15th &amp; 29th and March 7th &amp; 21st.<\/p> <p>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game.<\/p> <p>Each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers. In other words, if you join and stay in my game, you can be fairly certain it won't end until your character has reached the maximum level of experience.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet at the top of the \"up\" escalator inside the Barnes & Noble store.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/228891453\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":12600000,"name":"The Keeper of the Keys","id":"228891453","time":1456786800000,"updated":1456801041000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nyack","address_1":"142 Main Street (corner of Franklin and Main - the entrance is off the rear parking lot)","name":"Helen Hayes Studios","lon":-73.917915,"id":17020732,"state":"NY","lat":41.090652,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.8844184875,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1384987554000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come for the sheer joy of moving to the music, in a nurturing and supportive setting.<\/p> <p>Whether you have never danced before or want to continue, this is a class for you.<\/p> <p>The classes are one hour and half in length and provide quality instruction.<\/p> <p>Ballet is one of the most healthy and intense forms of dance.<br\/>It can provide a complete full-body workout, increasing your flexibility, range of motion and strength.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s also a great alternative to aerobics.<\/p> <p>The classes are on-going, join in anytime.<\/p> <p>PRICES Walk-Ins: $20.<br\/>Package: $180 for a card of 10 classes (over a course of 6 months).<br\/>Talk to us about multiple class per week discount!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR<br\/>Bruce Weitzmon is a choreographer, dancer and teacher.

The spacecraft New Horizons flew by Pluto, giving humanity its first pictures of the Ninth Planet. The journey was 9 years to get to Pluto, and the discoveries were beyond what anyone had expected. Jason Kendall will highlight the trip and what was found, as well as giving a bit of background to the battle over the word \u201cplanet.\u201d Then he will take us to Mars, where Curiosity has been roaming the surface, seeking signs of past habitability of Mars. The recent confirmation of current, seasonal water flows on Mars only raises our own desire to set foot on this not-so-alien world. Through the rovers and orbiters, we see a place that is quite familiar, and that popular media as well as serious explorers hope to put feet on the ground of the red planet within the next 20 to 30 years. We\u2019ll discuss the nature of the past conditions on Mars and how they were discovered and how humans may soon reach out and grasp the dirt of the Red Planet with their own hands.<\/p> <p>Jason Kendall is currently adjunct faculty at William Paterson University teaching astronomy. He holds a Master of Science in Astronomy from New Mexico State University and a Master of Fine Arts in Theater from the University of Texas at Austin. This unique combination has propelled him to be one of the foremost astronomy and science popularizers in the US. As a board member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York since 2008, Jason has led the over 200 events of stargazing and public astronomy outreach to upper Manhattan, including the historic Inwood Star Fest, where Inwood Hill Park lights were turned off as part of the 100 Hours of Astronomy event in IYA2009. This was the first time in New York City history when park lights were turned off for an astronomy event. Jason also focused on park safety due to an uptick in sexual assaults in Washington Heights and Inwood during 2011. Jason\u2019s start in astronomy was back in the fourth grade by the encouragement of two noted astronomers, Charles Schweighauser and Bart Bok. After seeing Saturn through Charlie's telescope at Sangamon State University on a clear Illinois night, and with Bart\u2019s encouragement and confidence, Jason studied astronomy to walk in their footsteps. This is not just a scientific journey, as Jason\u2019s great-grandfather was a Midwestern minister who used to preach his sermons out under the dark, cloudless nights. Landy Haven always believed that getting out and experiencing the wonders of the natural world was a central part of being a complete person. Landy\u2019s profound words under the stars continue to guide Jason in his quest to share the night sky as \"We look up to look within.\" jasonkendall.com<br\/>Date: February 29, 2016<\/p> <p>Time: 6:00 pm Reception, 7:00 pm Lecture<\/p> <p>Location: Club Headquarters, 46 East 70th Street, New York, NY, 10021<\/p> <p>Member Ticket price: $10<\/p> <p>Guest Ticket Price: $25<\/p> <p>Student Ticket Price:<\/p> <p>$5 w\/ a valid Student ID<\/p> <p>Reservation Notes:<\/p> <p>Reservations are allotted on a first-come, first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>To secure a reservation, please call us at[masked] or email us at [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blackhole\/events\/228328082\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":10800000,"name":"\"Pluto and Mars\" Public Lecture with Jason Kendall at The Explorers Club","id":"228328082","time":1456786800000,"updated":1456799766000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1194523820000,"name":"The NYC Physics and Astronomy Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":804843,"urlname":"blackhole","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Physics & Astronomy Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14198327065,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456017386000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The cost of the workshop is $12 .

RSVP-ing here is NOT sufficient. You must email or call the reservation line.<\/b><\/p> <p><b> Latest Discoveries at Pluto and Mars<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>2015 heralded astonishing discoveries in the Solar System. The spacecraft New Horizons flew by Pluto, giving humanity its first pictures of the Ninth Planet. The journey was 9 years to get to Pluto, and the discoveries were beyond what anyone had expected. Jason Kendall will highlight the trip and what was found, as well as giving a bit of background to the battle over the word \u201cplanet.\u201d Then he will take us to Mars, where Curiosity has been roaming the surface, seeking signs of past habitability of Mars. The recent confirmation of current, seasonal water flows on Mars only raises our own desire to set foot on this not-so-alien world. Through the rovers and orbiters, we see a place that is quite familiar, and that popular media as well as serious explorers hope to put feet on the ground of the red planet within the next 20 to 30 years. We\u2019ll discuss the nature of the past conditions on Mars and how they were discovered and how humans may soon reach out and grasp the dirt of the Red Planet with their own hands.<\/p> <p>Jason Kendall is currently adjunct faculty at William Paterson University teaching astronomy. He holds a Master of Science in Astronomy from New Mexico State University and a Master of Fine Arts in Theater from the University of Texas at Austin. This unique combination has propelled him to be one of the foremost astronomy and science popularizers in the US. As a board member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York since 2008, Jason has led the over 200 events of stargazing and public astronomy outreach to upper Manhattan, including the historic Inwood Star Fest, where Inwood Hill Park lights were turned off as part of the 100 Hours of Astronomy event in IYA2009. This was the first time in New York City history when park lights were turned off for an astronomy event. Jason also focused on park safety due to an uptick in sexual assaults in Washington Heights and Inwood during 2011. Jason\u2019s start in astronomy was back in the fourth grade by the encouragement of two noted astronomers, Charles Schweighauser and Bart Bok. After seeing Saturn through Charlie's telescope at Sangamon State University on a clear Illinois night, and with Bart\u2019s encouragement and confidence, Jason studied astronomy to walk in their footsteps. This is not just a scientific journey, as Jason\u2019s great-grandfather was a Midwestern minister who used to preach his sermons out under the dark, cloudless nights. Landy Haven always believed that getting out and experiencing the wonders of the natural world was a central part of being a complete person. Landy\u2019s profound words under the stars continue to guide Jason in his quest to share the night sky as \"We look up to look within.\" jasonkendall.com<br\/>Date: February 29, 2016<\/p> <p>Time: 6:00 pm Reception, 7:00 pm Lecture<\/p> <p>Location: Club Headquarters, 46 East 70th Street, New York, NY, 10021<\/p> <p>Member Ticket price: $10<\/p> <p>Guest Ticket Price: $25<\/p> <p>Student Ticket Price:<\/p> <p>$5 w\/ a valid Student ID<\/p> <p>Reservation Notes:<\/p> <p>Reservations are allotted on a first-come, first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>To secure a reservation, please call us at[masked] or email us at [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/new-york-brainiacs\/events\/228328078\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"\"Pluto and Mars\" Public Lecture with Jason Kendall at The Explorers Club","id":"228328078","time":1456786800000,"updated":1456799251000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221950508000,"name":"New York Brainiacs Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1286261,"urlname":"new-york-brainiacs","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Brainiacs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"13 West 38th Street","lon":-73.9837,"phone":"212-246-5984","name":"Bene Rialto","id":24167509,"state":"NY","lat":40.751503,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":0.346290230751,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454381451000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Networking social for NYC stylist to exchange ideas while discovering a unique Fashion Retail Incubator dedicated to growing brands and their business's through a community work space.<\/p> <p>Enjoy wine, small bites and good conversation on growing your styling business or learning how to get your's started.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP through our Eventbrite site :<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/new-york-city-stylists-social-networking-event-tickets-21242133794\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/new-york-city-stylists-social-networking-event-tickets-21242133794<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In the heart of the Fashion District.

He holds a Master of Science in Astronomy from New Mexico State University and a Master of Fine Arts in Theater from the University of Texas at Austin. This unique combination has propelled him to be one of the foremost astronomy and science popularizers in the US. As a board member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York since 2008, Jason has led the over 200 events of stargazing and public astronomy outreach to upper Manhattan, including the historic Inwood Star Fest, where Inwood Hill Park lights were turned off as part of the 100 Hours of Astronomy event in IYA2009. This was the first time in New York City history when park lights were turned off for an astronomy event. Jason also focused on park safety due to an uptick in sexual assaults in Washington Heights and Inwood during 2011. Jason\u2019s start in astronomy was back in the fourth grade by the encouragement of two noted astronomers, Charles Schweighauser and Bart Bok. After seeing Saturn through Charlie's telescope at Sangamon State University on a clear Illinois night, and with Bart\u2019s encouragement and confidence, Jason studied astronomy to walk in their footsteps. This is not just a scientific journey, as Jason\u2019s great-grandfather was a Midwestern minister who used to preach his sermons out under the dark, cloudless nights. Landy Haven always believed that getting out and experiencing the wonders of the natural world was a central part of being a complete person.

When you come, be prepared to talk about<br\/>--what your project is<br\/>--who your potential audience is (and what kind of readers you'd ideally like in your group)<br\/>--Where in the process you are*<br\/>--what kind of schedule you would like. (i.e. assuming each group looks at 3-4 pieces of 10-15 pages (double spaced) each time, do you want to read and submit once a month? once a week? Have more feedback and less submissions (with maybe 8 people in a group instead of 4?)<\/p> <p>Hopefully, but the end, we will have several working groups of 4-8 people, and you can all trade info, commit to a time (I would recommend 6-8 weeks) and have each other's contact information. (I don't think these should be posted on Meetup, because anyone can come to Meetup--these are committed working groups.)<\/p> <p><br\/>* Linda Joy Meyers defines three phases that I think are useful for full-length works. We might also have a group working on short essays.<br\/>*Kick-starting: \"You are beginning to learn what your story is trying to become. You discover significant moments that create the spine of your memoir. You clarify your themes and free-write your memories. You learn about sorting through themes and topics, character development and how to sketch an outline for the rest of your book. In this stage you get acquainted with what a memoir requires of you and what it will give back.<\/p> <p>The Muddy Middle: In this stage you start to question why are are writing a memoir. Self-doubt and the inner critic start whispering in your ear, and yet you're also learning a lot--about yourself, the past, and the kind of structure and story line your memoir needs. Doubts that have to do with memory, family, and truth come up at this time. You learn how to affirm yourself and your writing. You learn to find the structure that your memoir needs during this stage, and how to write your way to the end of a first draft. This stage is long, exciting, tiring and exhilarating. It's a ride that gets you to \"the End.\"<\/p> <p>* Birthing your book: This is the later phase of writing your memoir, the home stretch. By now you know your story, you have solved many of the problems of ploy and memory and you've made your way through various bouts of self-doubt. Your story has helped to teach you the focus of your work and you have learned many writing skills by this stage. You have a clear sense of what you are writing about. You are past the Muddy Middle. You can see \"the End\" looming. You are celebrating, and you are beginning to think about editing and building a platform, and you're continuing to read memoirs that feed your learning curve. You learn to become your own editor in the revision process, which is a part of this stage, and you're in the process of deciding how you want to have your books published.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Memoir-Writers-Meetup\/events\/228884225\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Matchmaking for writing goups","id":"228884225","time":1456790400000,"updated":1456871243000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1454609104000,"name":"New York Memoir Writers Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19509641,"urlname":"New-York-Memoir-Writers-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Memoirists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"45 Ave., 45 Rd. bet. 11 St. and 21 St. ","name":"John F.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.\u00a0<br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses\u00a0<br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.\u00a0<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you\u00a0<br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind\u00a0<br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.\u00a0<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The talk will be given by Donn Felker, a Google Developer Expert on Android.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Learn about the new mobile database on the block, Realm. With Realm you work with regular Java objects - not SQL, cursors or object mappers. These same Java objects are native to Realm. Learn how to use Realm and its reactive features to build apps faster and more efficiently without having to write a line of SQL. You'll leave with a firm understanding of how to install, setup, store and retrieve data with a Realm database. When you get back to the office you can use Realm to help you focus on solving a business problem instead of worrying about how to get your data in and out of a database.<\/p> <p>Pizza and beer will be provided by Audible!<\/p> <p>Audible Inc.<br\/>1 Washington Place, Newark, NJ, 15th Floor (map)<\/p> <p>How to get here:<br\/>1.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols.

Send your best, a recent shoot or something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713519\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713519","time":1456873200000,"updated":1456878164000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/4270306722363417603","name":"Online","lon":0,"id":24392053,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456512152000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join Leigh Drogen, CEO of Estimize, and Vinesh Jha, CEO of ExtractAlpha, former director of Quantitative Research at StarMine, and Seong Lee, client engineer at Quantopian, as we explore the differences between crowd-sourced earnings estimates versus Wall Street.

You really only need to meet one person to make your entire night worthwhile if you know what you are doing. You will have an opportunity to speak to everyone in the room, and you will absolutely meet people you might\u00a0otherwise\u00a0never have an opportunity to meet and you will see that's it's not what you are selling or how you sell it that matters, you will instead learn the importance of building 'know, like and trust' relationships!

While we are, and will continue to be, mostly a social group, we'd like to step up the number of activist events we do.<\/p> <p>This March 1st event will be outreach to the general public to promote and encourage a vegan diet &amp; lifestyle. We will hand out literature in a welcoming manner so our audience will be open to seeing how great the benefits of veganism are\u00a0for people, the non-human animals who share our world, and the planet itself.<\/p> <p>We will meet at the designated location in Union Square at 6:30 pm (please arrive on time!). After a brief discussion on strategy and positioning of people, along with a few reminders for the group, we'll leaflet from 6:45 pm to 7:45 pm. Then our group will reassemble at the designated location and walk over to a nearby, all-vegan restaurant to have dinner, discuss our experiences and thoughts, and socialize.<\/p> <p>We know that not everyone in our group is vegan, but on this day we will be promoting veganism. You are very welcome to join us even if you are not yet 100% vegan, but please understand that the literature we will hand out will promote a purely vegan lifestyle. Mostly on this day you will be handing out literature rather than talking to people, but if you do happen to speak with people, we are promoting a vegan diet and lifestyle for\u00a0their tremendous benefits.<\/p> <p><b>Where to meet:<\/b> We will be meeting at the extreme southwest corner of Union Square Park, <b>where Union Square West meets East 14th Street. We'll meet on the actual park block, right on the corner. You will see us holding a \"VEG MEETUP\" sign.<\/b> We will meet right at 6:30pm. You may want to plan on being there early in order to be on time. Don't be late! We will talk for 15 minutes and then disperse to various nearby locations in the park.<\/p> <p>We believe that grass-roots activism is vital in advancing the ideal, practice, and potential normalization of veganism in our world.

Kandel,\u00a0<i>The Age of Insight<\/i>\u00a0takes us to Vienna 1900, where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind\u2014our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions\u2014and how mind and brain relate to art.<\/p> <p>The Vienna School of Medicine led the way with its realization that truth lies hidden beneath the surface. That principle infused Viennese culture and strongly influenced the other pioneers of Vienna 1900. Sigmund Freud shocked the world with his insights into how our everyday unconscious aggressive and erotic desires are repressed and disguised in symbols, dreams, and behavior. Arthur Schnitzler revealed women\u2019s unconscious sexuality in his novels through his innovative use of the interior monologue. Gustav Klimt, Oscar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele created startlingly evocative and honest portraits that expressed unconscious lust, desire, anxiety, and the fear of death.<\/p> <p>Kandel tells the story of how these pioneers\u2014Freud, Schnitzler, Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele\u2014inspired by the Vienna School of Medicine, in turn influenced the founders of the Vienna School of Art History to ask pivotal questions such as What does the viewer bring to a work of art? How does the beholder respond to it? These questions prompted new and ongoing discoveries in psychology and brain biology, leading to revelations about how we see and perceive, how we think and feel, and how we respond to and create works of art. Kandel, one of the leading scientific thinkers of our time, places these five innovators in the context of today\u2019s cutting-edge science and gives us a new understanding of the modernist art of Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele, as well as the school of thought of Freud and Schnitzler. Reinvigorating the intellectual enquiry that began in Vienna 1900,\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>The Age of Insight<\/i>\u00a0is a wonderfully written, superbly researched, and beautifully illustrated book that also provides a foundation for future work in neuroscience and the humanities. It is an extraordinary book from an international leader in neuroscience and intellectual history.<\/p> <p>This event is hosted by Bob Braine. for information on this month's book, email [masked].

While her longtime lover, S\u00f8ren\u2014whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruin\u2014is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora's lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury.<\/p> <p>Her host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends.<\/p> <p>But while her flesh is willing, Nora's mind is wandering. To thoughts of S\u00f8ren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora's past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It's a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nSo This is where we usually include one good review and one bad review from Goodreads. \u00a0But I honestly couldn't find a bad review. Just a lot of \"OMG Love This Book\" and a lot of pictures of that Scarsgard dude from True Blood. \u00a0So enjoy I guess.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSee you in March at Smutty Book Club!<\/p> <p>Dawn<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are the loud laughing people in the back.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

We\u2019ve personally watched the group grow in passion and excitement, which makes this announcement that much more fulfilling.<\/p> <p><br\/>Every month starting from March, the Think Tank will propose a moonshot challenge for all interested members and participants to solve. Each month will kick off a\u00a0<b>4-week incubation period<\/b>\u00a0that will nurture any and all ideas that tackle the monthly challenge into viable product plans. You'll be provided with valuable resources, network, and guidance on every step of the way, so you will never feel like you are solving this alone.<\/p> <p><br\/>This month of March, we\u2019re going to be investigating the topic of <b>Urban Farming<\/b>. Along with Think Tank leaders and a local entrepreneur making waves in NYC urban farming, you\u2019ll be able to learn about this area of emerging technology as well as creating a solution that could revolutionize it.<\/p> <p><br\/>The challenge that we\u2019re proposing is the following:<\/p> <p><i>Create a solution that makes\u00a0vegetative\u00a0urban farming fun,\u00a0accessible, and financially feasible for the average NYC resident, while supporting the city\u2019s impoverished and promoting environmental sustainability.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p>There are 5 parts to this challenge explained:<\/p> <p><b>Fun<\/b>: Right now urban farming is considered a \u2018nice to have\u2019 niche. But as you will learn at this event, the idea of growing one\u2019s produce can involve something very different than the perceived inconvenience of managing your own produce.<\/p> <p><b>Accessible<\/b>:\u00a0Your solution should be easily accessible by the average NYC resident. No expensive equipment or complex assembly\/maintenance please!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Financially feasible<\/b>: The only way that urban farming can gain traction in a city like NYC is through business incentives. Commercial models and cost saving measures will offer us the first two major areas of improvement when it comes to grocery shopping and food access.<\/p> <p><b>Supporting the impoverished<\/b>: Urban farming can provide a potentially limitless source of food for a city setting. We believe that those who currently lack access to fresh, nutritious produce will greatly benefit from this abundance.<\/p> <p><b>Promoting environmental sustainability:\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0By growing food in our own urban backyard, we can significantly reduce carbon emission due to external food transportation and more efficient means of production.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, if you want to learn more about urban farming, create an innovative and\u00a0effective solution to this challenge from scratch, and make impact in NYC (and the greater world of course), definitely show up this Tuesday!! We'll have brainstorming session and assemble teams based on the qualities of the idea from the brainstorms. At the end of March, there will be a\u00a0<b>Think Tank Pitchfest<\/b>, where all participating teams pitch their hashed-out idea\/product plan to the audience and a panel of judges, which may include potential investors and industry experts. \u00a0We\u2019ll provide more details over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's make it happen.\u00a0See you soon!<\/p> <p><br\/>The Think Tank Team<\/p> <p>\n\n\nP.S.

Many people are also aware of using EFT for physical well being. Sometimes we need to look at the emotional aspects that may be behind the issues of concern, and sometimes we just tap directly on the symptoms and notice if we get relief just from that. Its very nice when this happens and it happens a lot.<\/p> <p>Tong Ren is another form of healing using tapping but unlike EFT it doesnt involve any dialog to describe the issues of concern. We just tap on a surragate model (Tong Ren) as if we were doing acupunture on a real body with intention of healing and it works!!!!<\/p> <p>We'll meet at Jain's home in Scarsdale every 2nd and 4th Tuesday evening and whoever is interested in joining us is welcome.

In the\u00a0middle of that awesome visualization I felt a burst, a huge leap of energy expanding in my heart chakra (and since I am an energy healer it makes so much sense). Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears. I can feel at ease knowing I have this new tool in my hands, it's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and\u00a0I wanted to first thank you for hosting this. I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I love how you said to write down all your thoughts\/ lists about yourself, as well as goals, to see where the conflicts lie. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"I met Ayelet at a free Lust to Love Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>Ayelet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron\">www.Facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron<\/a>) is a relationship expert. I asked for her advice regarding my recent breakup with my boyfriend of six years, which is why I went to her event. Ayelet explained that we have a tendency to constantly chase guys who don't treat us right, and we have expectations of other people that in turn, create unhappiness in our lives. Working on the root chakra helps us let go of those expectations and find inner peace.<\/p> <p>The meditation event helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships.

Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share.

Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! \u00a0All first time guests can come without becoming a full Collective member.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713532\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713532","time":1456959600000,"updated":1456965498000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"394 Broadway, 5th Floor","name":"Impact Hub NYC","lon":-74.002365,"id":24165205,"state":"NY","lat":40.718342,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":2.28586030006,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1452036780000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCJan6\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCMar2\"&gt;<a href=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/7Ik_0dW124jxjIA6rwJHVrMDreJ0Ib0njZPtOoTLstH_fr3SB0PyjJpBv0db6YHo_LGuEzuW3PO9gDNjm4NP0_DN8MpjtZiE1PPA7VBmJSiMbpNUsJdTR4RHLzNSKEd3WN-S-IQk\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/7Ik_0dW124jxjIA6rwJHVrMDreJ0Ib0njZPtOoTLstH_fr3SB0PyjJpBv0db6YHo_LGuEzuW3PO9gDNjm4NP0_DN8MpjtZiE1PPA7VBmJSiMbpNUsJdTR4RHLzNSKEd3WN-S-IQk<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCMar2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/yqVZz-TRO3hAbt92MYIhcDOK4iHRSSGFPiYA04n5K8xnlPw6LvQQsKVP3BytHJRqMagIuI_Icpke4lIYAWBd3_xfF3ti8Q2fNLcfo9nbPaIY-9Ot5ORizidBzs458abOPxE2IYiV\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/yqVZz-TRO3hAbt92MYIhcDOK4iHRSSGFPiYA04n5K8xnlPw6LvQQsKVP3BytHJRqMagIuI_Icpke4lIYAWBd3_xfF3ti8Q2fNLcfo9nbPaIY-9Ot5ORizidBzs458abOPxE2IYiV<\/a><\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evaluateforchange.com\/\">Evaluate for Change<\/a>\u2019s 6-week <b><i><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCMar2\">Introduction to Measuring Your Impact for Social Sector Professionals<\/a><\/i><\/b>\u00a0course is for individuals interested in learning the skills needed to become data-driven and results-oriented.<\/p> <p><b>===========================================<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a paid course.

Whether you are looking to advance your career or focus on helping your current organization become stronger, you will leave with the skills you need to measure your impact.<\/p> <p>All 6-week courses will be conducted through hands-on activities, out-of-class assignments, and readings. Using a small class size model ensures that all students get one-on-one time with trainers. Students should expect to spend 2-3 hours each week outside of class completing readings and assignments. This course is ideal for individuals with little to no evaluation and data experience. The six-week course covers the following topics in detail:<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 1 (Mar. 2): Understanding the Power of Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Explore the broad reasons for engaging in evaluation in order to understand the power that data can deliver to your organization. This session provides students a high-level overview of the evaluation cycle. Learn why using data-driven practices are important and leave knowing how to articulate how the social sector can leverage data to measure their impact.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 2 (Mar. 9): Assessment Phase &amp; Logic Models<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Dissecting programs through a critical analysis helps to articulate the core components of any initiative, including inputs, outputs, and expected outcomes \u2013 also known as conducting a Logic Model or Theory of Change.\u00a0 Determine what data you already track and what data still needs to be collected for each component. Explore the complementary aspects of regular data collection, and targeted, periodic evaluation.<\/p> <p><b><i>Week 3 (Mar. 16): Transforming Programming into Measureable Outcomes &amp; Outputs<\/i>\u00a0<\/b>Want to make sure your measurement tools are as efficient as possible? First, you need to make sure you are asking the right questions. In this training, we start by breaking down your program\u2019s purpose and mission. Throughout the process we train nonprofit professionals to be strategic when designing an evaluation. Participants will leave with a set of variables\/indicators to be used in a survey or interview and discuss how they could be best measured.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 4 (Mar. 23): Designing Measurement Tools Using a Mixed-Methods Approach<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Sometimes, numbers can give you a good indication of how well an organization is doing, but it\u2019s not always the whole story. Organizations need to also support evidence of their impact with humanizing stories and real-world anecdotes of how their program changes lives. Explore the complementary aspects of quantitative and qualitative research and be ready to address your own biases!\u00a0 Learn about mixed methods approaches and how to develop measurement tools that actually capture the results you are looking to measure.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 5 (Mar. 30): Organizing, Managing, and Analyzing Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Once you have collected your data, the next step is to take it from raw data to aggregate results. It is imperative to value the methodologies of this process over simply obtaining advanced statistical technological programs. Learning how to handle your data and manage any pitfalls that occurred during the implementation phase will help you maximize the data you have collected.\u00a0 This will also mitigate the effects of any less-than-perfect implementations. Learn more advanced methodologies to help you ensure your analysis is sound and impress stakeholders.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 6 (Apr. 6): Storytelling Using Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Having aggregate data of your evaluation is not enough. This session will teach you how to craft this data in a format that effectively conveys your true impact. Understanding how to present your results to a variety of audiences ensures your efforts are communicated in the best light. Learn how to take your results to the next level by analyzing your audience and customizing your data to convince all stakeholders that you are making a real impact.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0<\/a><\/p> <p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.evaluateforchange.com\/\"><b>Evaluate for Change<\/b><\/a>, we are dedicated to shifting the social sector towards a more data-driven and results-oriented industry, all while remembering people are more than just numbers!

We try to adjust the numbers on the Meetup to reflect that, but we err on the side of lowballing. As of Nov. 2015 we are averaging out around 25 people<b> throughout the night<\/b> though for special events we've had up to 80.<\/p> <p>HOW MUCH IS THIS EVENT?<\/p> <p>There's no admission fee, but there is a two drink minimum* which you will be expected to honor.<\/p> <p>* (or monetary equivalent in non-alcoholic purchases if you don't touch the stuff.)<\/p> <p>WHAT TYPE OF GAMES ARE PLAYED?<\/p> <p>All types. Real short bluffing games decorated with skulls and flowers. Cooperative games fighting horrible diseases. Classic euro games where you haggle over sheep and wheat. Whether you want to fight unspeakable horrors in Arkham or build railroads across America or rebuild your farm after the black plague (more fun than it sounds) you can probably find a game you would like.<\/p> <p>Some games you might see are 7 Wonders, Settlers of Catan, Pandemic, Dominion, Dixit, Puerto Rico, Eldritch Horror, Ticket to Ride, Carcasonne among many others. You're also welcome to bring any game you want to play!<\/p> <p>I DON'T KNOW THESE GAMES? IS IT COOL IF I COME?<\/p> <p>We're very friendly and if you have no idea what the hell we're talking about just trust us when we say it's ton of fun. We'll have tons of games and we're very happy to show you the rules. Hang out, haves some drinks, and learn a new game.<\/p> <p>Questions? Comments?

The place is a blue-collar town in upstate New York, where five high school girls are joined in a gang dedicated to pride, power and vengeance on a world that seems made to denigrate and destroy them. Foxfire is an engrossing, often shocking evocation of female rage, gallantry, and grit. Here is the secret history of a sisterhood of blood, a haven from a world of male oppressors, marked by liberating fury that burns too hot to last. Above all, it is the story of Legs Sadovsky, with her lean, on-the-edge, icy beauty, whose nerve, muscle, hate, and hurt maker her the spark of Foxfire. Amid scenes of violence and vengeance lies this novel's greatest power: the exquisite, astonishing rendering of the bonds that link the Foxfire girls together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\/\/ <b>Location<br\/><\/b>Location will be announced soon.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\/\/ <b>Dues\u00a0<br\/><\/b>This book club does not require annual membership dues.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/226908432\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklyvfbdb","time":1456963200000,"updated":1456977306000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"48 Wall Street ","name":"Hope Hill","lon":-74.009041,"id":24244721,"state":"NY","lat":40.706566,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.16892170906,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456802312000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/1\/b\/600_447401499.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ve all made mistakes, and we\u2019ve all had others hurt and wound us \u2014 sometimes in ways that scar us emotionally.

Whether you are looking to connect with a loved one who has recently passed or to receive messages from spirit, our group offers a warm and friendly environment to all who are interested. Before each s\u00e9ance we begin our group with a 15 minute lesson on psychic development, covering topics from psychic impressions to spirit communication. We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours. The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20.

We even think anger will help us \u2018win\u2019 our battles, and we rely on it as if it were our trusted friend. The mind of anger, however, leaves a trail of broken relationships, lost opportunities, and painful feelings in its wake. In this class, we will learn to use Buddha\u2019s skillful techniques to remain balanced, flexible and peaceful in the midst of difficult circumstances, thereby overcoming our real enemy, the painful mind of anger itself. It is not enough to simple KNOW anger is a negative force in our lives, we need to see it for ourselves. It is only when we understand the dangers of anger that we actually develop the internal power to oppose and reduce its effects. In this series, we will learn to meditate on anger and patience, discovering how to transform a disturbed, turbulent mind into a peaceful attitude that will enable us to solve our conflicts and leave us feeling peaceful and focused.<\/p> <p>The classes will include instruction, guided meditations and discussion.<\/p> <p>The mind-training methods taught in this course include meditation and meditation break exercises; these are tried-and-tested methods which can be practiced by anyone\u2013regardless of prior experience.<br\/>Give yourself and your loved ones the gift of a patient mind!<\/p> <p>$15 suggested donation.

You're invited to turn on yourself, your relationships, your sex. This is the place to excavate what you truly desire through fun communication games with open minded, sex-positive people. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself? We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

At its core is a stream processing engine that enables development of highly performant, fully scalable and completely fault tolerant enterprise grade applications on Hadoop. It is in production use in various industries where real time performance and fault tolerance are critical. It also comes with rich set of functional building blocks and an easy to use API for the developers to build real-time and batch applications. Apex applications are multi-tenant and run natively on YARN and HDFS alongside your other Hadoop applications. DataTorrent Inc was the initial developer of Apex and contributed it to the Apache Foundation. It continues to be actively involved in the development of Apache Apex and offers an enterprise edition of Apex. In this talk you will learn about Apex, the different features and functionality it offers and the architectural overview. You will also see demo applications and in this context see the tools provided by the DataTorrent enterprise edition. You will also see hands-on development of an Apex application from scratch in Java and see it running in Hadoop.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Presenter:\u00a0<b>Pramod Immaneni\u00a0<\/b>is Apache Apex (incubating) PPMC member, committer and senior architect at DataTorrent Inc, where he works on Apex and specializes in big data applications. Prior to DataTorrent he was a co-founder and CTO of Leaf Networks LLC, eventually acquired by Netgear Inc, where he built products in core networking space and was granted patents in peer-to-peer VPNs. Prior to that he was a technical co-founder of a mobile startup where he was an architect of a dynamic content rendering engine for mobile devices.<\/p> <p>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"It is an online Webcast","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Apache-Apex-New-York-Chapter\/events\/229238803\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"Stream Processing with Apache Apex - Next Gen Native Hadoop Big Data Platform","id":"229238803","time":1456966800000,"updated":1456975801000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446585303000,"name":"Apache Apex (native Hadoop), New York Chapter","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19087720,"urlname":"Apache-Apex-New-York-Chapter","group_lat":40.75,"who":"BigFoots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"406 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"OneTaste New York Center","lon":0,"id":23779946,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439325416000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/0\/0\/600_441335840.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and TurnOn.
