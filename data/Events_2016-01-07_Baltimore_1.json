Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit.<\/p> <p>For this weeks Sound Bath I will begin with a brief guided visualization to bring in peace.\u00a0I will be using many types of sound healing from ancient drumming, to newer technologies of Crystal singing bowls and many more in between. \u00a0You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. \u00a0From there all you need to do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

However, riding weather is not fully predictable so we need to set some expectations for what is \"reasonable.\"<\/p> <p>Weather forecasts more than 4 days ahead of a ride are only a guide to what may come. As the date of the ride gets closer the forecast becomes more accurate but then needs to be read in detail to decide if you will participate. 50% probability of rain looks pretty bad at first glance but what about 50% probability of .1\" ending at 5am on ride day? The day's forecast will continue to show 50% probability and many riders will stay home on a great riding day.<\/p> <p>I generally use 30% probability forecast at the time of the ride as acceptable, especially if the amount is measured in tenths of an inch. Looking at an online weather map set in motion will also tell us if we're going to be in the middle of something ugly or just skirting the edges. If a ride encounters rain, we take whatever steps are necessary to ensure a safe, comfortable ride including delayed start, shelter for a while, modified route or even last minute cancellation in the worst case. With a 30% probability of rain forecast, I have only had 1 of about 15 rides get rained on and that was intermittent.<\/p> <p>[b]I prefer that if you want to participate in a ride, RSVP without consideration for the weather [\/b]but include a note indicating your intent to stay home if it rains. [b]This tells me that there is group interest in the ride and you can update your RSVP anytime. Otherwise, I get the impression that there isn't any interest in the ride and accordingly may never schedule that ride again.[\/b]<\/p> <p>Bottom line, communicate. [b]Let me know what you're thinking and be sure to have an accurate RSVP by ride day since I may ride an hour to the start point only to find myself the only one there.[\/b]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WomenOn2-3\/events\/227597692\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Glen Rock Mill Inn Rest in Glen Rock, PA - Sunny & 75!","id":"227597692","time":1451232000000,"updated":1451256069000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1361744421000,"name":"Women On Two & Three","group_lon":-76.4100036621,"id":7328372,"urlname":"WomenOn2-3","group_lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Lady Riders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"411 Cathedral Street","name":"My Sister's Place Women's Center","lon":-76.616798,"id":23718168,"state":"MD","lat":39.294788,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":0.373293042183,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":15,"created":1436480129000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>My Sister's Place relies on volunteers. \u00a0Please be sure to update your RSVP if your plans change<\/b><\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>My Sister's Place Women's Center serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, 7 days week, to homeless women and their children.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Breakfast: 7am - 9am<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Lunch: 11am - 1:30pm<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Dinner: 4pm - 6:30pm<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Volunteer Duties:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Prepare food<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Serve guests,\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 Refill drinks<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Clear plates<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Parking will be available at the Franklin Street Garage, located at<br\/>15 W.

All players take home a limited edition Cthulhu Gangster Standee! \u00a0In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can't agree on the split! It's time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!<\/p> <p>Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.<\/p> <p>Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their gun...s by secretly selecting either a \"Bang!\" or a \"Click! Click!\" card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on \"Three\" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.<\/p> <p>Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a \"Bang!\" takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table \u2014 money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a \"Bang!\" card to your hand) \u2014 until everything has been claimed.<\/p> <p>After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be where they are playing this game--either on the Sales Floor or in the back in the game room.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boardgames-543\/events\/227323960\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"\"Cash and Guns\"--This is a Game","id":"227323960","time":1451430000000,"updated":1451442223000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1207503530000,"name":"The Anne Arundel Boardgames Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1099209,"urlname":"boardgames-543","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Game Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":14.8717002869,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449009268000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Stitchin-and-Bitchin\/events\/227168668\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Craft and Chat","id":"gpxpmlytqbmc","time":1451430000000,"updated":1451441933000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379449501000,"name":"Stitchin' and Bitchin'","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":10310672,"urlname":"Stitchin-and-Bitchin","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"craft lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"Key Highway & Pierside Dr","name":"Key Highway & Pierside Dr","lon":0,"id":17421062,"state":"MD","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.48455500603,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1387310742000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We'll start at 23 Pierside Drive...on the sidewalk at the corner of Pierside\/Cross St. &amp; Key Highway.<\/p> <p>Parking is available at meters along Key Hwy. but you have to pay. \u00a0Free parking is available on Covington st which is one street up parallel to Key Highway.<\/p> <p>We generally stick to the harbor route (running along the water) so that people can run at their own pace\/distance and turn around whenever they are ready to.<\/p> <p>For those interested, we generally go to Social Pie and Pub <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialpubbaltimore.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialpubbaltimore.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.socialpubbaltimore.com\/<\/a><\/a> for half price pizza on Tuesdays!

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

Once the weather and water warm up virtually all of our paddling events go to a wait list. \u00a0It frequently happens\u00a0within\u00a0minutes of them opening for RSVP's.<\/p> <p>The VOLUNTARY annual dues for 2015 remain unchanged at $16.00 per year if paid online using a credit or debit card by signing up for this non-event. \u00a0You can also just hand me $15.00 cash at any paddle. \u00a0About every 7 to 14 days I will go through those who have paid and give you a *2015 in your profile and remove your name from the list on this page.<\/p> <p>The dues are for the 2015 CALENDAR year. \u00a0If you pay them in November or December I will also give you credit for the following year. \u00a0If you did that last year your should already have the *2015 designation in your profile. \u00a0If not, please send me a quick note and I will correct it.<\/p> <p>CKA event hosts get their Voluntary dues paid for them. \u00a0It is the only compensation they receive other than our profound thanks for what is ultimately a lot of work. \u00a0Be sure to tell them how much you appreciate what they do to help organize and plan events while keeping us safe on the water.<\/p> <p>The group and it's activities are my only means of support or income and I have several years to go before I am eligible for retirement. \u00a0I can assure you that the amount of time effort and resources I put into this group are significantly more than the few thousand dollars I receive from this system but if you have a problem with that concept, they are VOLUNTARY. \u00a0Don't pay them, I guarantee I won't hold it against you. \u00a0<\/p> <p>CKA offers it's members more opportunities to get out and paddle with the camaraderie and safety of a group more times per year in well organized thoughtfully planned events than any of the other great kayaking organizations in the area. \u00a0If you own your own boat there is usually no cost to you for the majority of our weekly events throughout the season.<\/p> <p>Chuck<\/p> <p>02\/23\/2015: \u00a0I know lots of you, especially the newer members of the group have lots of questions about how things work around here. \u00a0I have been working on our Season Startup Newsletter and expect to get it out to all of you by the end of this week. \u00a0It should answer a most of those questions. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures\/events\/220703773\/","yes_rsvp_count":101,"name":"Pay Your *2015 VOLUNTARY Annual Dues Here","id":"220703773","time":1451606400000,"updated":1451618588000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1320709784000,"name":"Chesapeake Kayak Adventures","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":2775772,"urlname":"Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures","group_lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Chesapeake Paddlers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hanover","address_1":"7000 Arundel Mills Circle","name":"Dave and Buster's","lon":-76.725616,"id":23611202,"state":"MD","lat":39.162334,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.4981880188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447780020000,"fee":{"amount":46.6500015259,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":12,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Celebrate 2015 and bring in 2016 with a room full of fun and friendly Christian Singles at Dave &amp;

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

Each time we interact with another we make an exchange on the more subtle levels of our being and even after we physically separate from the other, energetic and emotional ties remain. Energetic cords are not restricted by space or time, so you can be connected to someone far away, a person from your past, or someone who is no longer living. The same we are attached with our old believe systems and programming.<\/p> <p>Your belief system is the actual set of precepts from which you live your daily life, those which govern your thoughts, words, and actions.<\/p> <p>Cords are a method of high speed communication and sharing energy. Healthy cords create a nurturing sharing of information and energy. Unhealthy cords can be a huge drain or a means of control. They are attached by mutual agreement, but there are lots of ways to persuade, trick, or con people into being corded. Often they were useful, but outlive their usefulness. The cord may have been very important. Anytime you are transitioning to a new stage or phase of your life and you feel there are things you need to let go of cord cutting is a very simple and beneficial tool to release!<br\/>Cutting a cord does not mean ending a relationship with a person or a believe system. It means releasing problems that repeat endlessly on the level of energy.<br\/>One of many benefit from cutting cords are growth, healing, release of toxins in organs\/tissues, to trigger the natural growth of healthy chakras, to positively change relationships, to embrace happiness and bliss; to see the glass as half full, increased creativity, to conquer the carnal self to unite with the higher self and to ultimately become an active participant in one\u2019s own evolutionary enfoldment.<\/p> <p>Class Fee is $25.00, if paid in advance, $30.00 at the door.<br\/>Larry Lambert will facilitate this guided visualization.<br\/>RSVP today to reserve your seat for this event.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If you are unfamiliar with the Crofton area GPS the Friendly's restaurant in Crofton, MD and as you enter the parking lot you will pass our building.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tranquil-Souls-Maryland-Meetup\/events\/227559924\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cord Cutting of Belief Systems or Attachments","id":"227559924","time":1451847600000,"updated":1451871100000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1408468055000,"name":"Tranquil Souls Maryland Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":16489602,"urlname":"Tranquil-Souls-Maryland-Meetup","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Enlightened Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"20715","country":"us","city":"Bowie","phone":"301-233-1694","address_1":"3120 Belair Dr","name":"Imagine Yoga & Wellness Center","lon":-76.741503,"id":1460315,"state":"MD","lat":38.975479,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.7322025299,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442163879000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Whether you feel as though you are just starting your spiritual journey or you\u2019ve found an unexpected fork in the road,\u00a0First Day Reflections at Imagine Yoga &amp; Wellness Center offers a place just right for you to listen to the wisdom of your own heart.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/227470273\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglyvcbhb","time":1452033000000,"updated":1452044846000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion Post #22","lon":-76.604248,"id":11655302,"state":"MD","lat":39.39748,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.48896884918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451724911000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Here's the scoop from Betsy101's web page:<\/p> <p>\"Lower impact Zumba Gold makes it possible for almost EVERYONE to Zumba!

Try waking up in a Maryland trauma center two months after being blown up in an MRAP (mine-resistant ambush protected) vehicle in Afghanistan. That's what happened to Adam Keys. An Army Sgt. in the 27th Engineer Battalion, Adam lost his best friend from middle school in the attack plus three other soldiers as they were working to keep supply lines open. He was given practically no odds of recovery by his doctors, but his mom, Julie, never gave up hope or the belief that Adam was still \u201cin there\u201d as he lay motionless in a hospital bed with a raging infection that would later claim three of his limbs in order for him to survive. A triple amputee, Adam and Julie will take us on a journey of self belief, positive attitude and struggle to overcome life\u2019s greatest challenges. All great messages to start off the year in 2016. Don't miss this story!<\/p> <p>Meeting will begin at 11:30 am on Wednesday January 6th at Union Jack's British Pub, located at 2072 Somerville Road in Annapolis with networking, with lunch promptly served at noon as the program gets underway.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>The 1747 Pub downstairs from Reynold's Tavern at Church Circle in Annapolis is an excellent place for happy hour. It's a vibrant pub with tasty food and an open bar area with a warm and inviting fireplace that provides a cozy ambience. Their special on Wednesdays is half-price wings and $5 burgers.<\/p> <p>Our SHR group has visited the 1747 Pub several times and really enjoyed it. Let's give it another try!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Full details, directions, and reviews of the 1747 Pub below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.reynoldstavern.org\/about\/about-the-1747-pub\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:30 pm to hopefully find a good spot in the bar area.

What that means to a beginner, is that you will work on the most basic part of the step (for example, a slow balanced movement that will lead to a shimmy), while more experienced dancers will work at their level (maybe taking a shimmy up to tempo, or sliding it around, or walking tossing their hair, chewing gum and shimmying).

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter the building anywhere and follow the Columbia Insight Meditation signs to the room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/events\/227523136\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"duration":5400000,"name":"Insight Meditation Class","id":"cjtwjlyvcbjb","time":1452126600000,"updated":1452133634000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334625474000,"name":"Columbia Insight Meditation Group","group_lon":-76.8700027466,"id":3684172,"urlname":"Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"20770","country":"us","city":"Greenbelt","address_1":"1 Hillside Rd","name":"Greenbelt Community Church","lon":-76.875565,"id":7127602,"state":"MD","lat":39.004875,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.0410232544,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1352350792000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greenbelt-Toastmasters\/events\/227256463\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Greenbelt Toastmasters Meeting -- All Welcome!","id":"dnkhtdyvcbjb","time":1452126600000,"updated":1452138249000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1305286723000,"name":"Greenbelt Toastmasters","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":1853161,"urlname":"Greenbelt-Toastmasters","group_lat":39,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21117","country":"us","city":"Reisterstown","address_1":"5513 Deer Park Road","name":"Baltimore Ramblers Club House","lon":-76.840263,"id":5999132,"state":"MD","lat":39.421211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.8849000931,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1330813816000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There is always something going on.\u00a0 We have a schedule full of rides and events.\u00a0 Join us to find out more.<\/p> <p>No Need to RSVP<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=5513+Deer+Park+Road,+Reisterstown,+MD&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=39.426514,-76.838894&amp;spn=0.036597,0.094585&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.365962,96.855469&amp;oq=5513+Deer+Park+Road&amp;hnear=5513+Deer+Park+Rd,+Reisterstown,+Baltimore,+Maryland+21117&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A\">Click for Map &amp; Directions<\/a> <img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/d\/6\/event_98249142.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"3 minutes from 795 See directions below","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Ramblers-Motorcycle-Club-Meetup-Group\/events\/227071646\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Baltimore Ramblers Club Meeting (1st Wednesday of each month)","id":"qvvfqcyvcbjb","time":1452128400000,"updated":1452140771000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330811916000,"name":"Baltimore Ramblers Motorcycle Club Meetup Group","group_lon":-76.8099975586,"id":3408932,"urlname":"Baltimore-Ramblers-Motorcycle-Club-Meetup-Group","group_lat":39.4700012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":1180,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":380,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
