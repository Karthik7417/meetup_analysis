Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.

As corporate America becomes more inclusive and further diversifies its supply chain, certification offers the opportunity for LGBT-owned businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors.<\/p>","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":68500742,"name":"Joe Renga"},"members":151,"name":"New Jersey LGBT Chamber of Commerce","id":18757966,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-LGBT-Chamber-of-Commerce","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437503918000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LES-Writers-Salon\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Fiction writers, playwrights, and poets who want to get critiqued , get published, and make friends.<\/p> \n<p>No memoir writers please<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138438392,"name":"Ana Wieder Blank"},"members":12,"name":"LES  Writers Salon","id":18758170,"state":"NY","urlname":"LES-Writers-Salon","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437508595000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"exchangestud","name":"International and Exchange Students","id":3451},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/embracepotential-events\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.embracepotential.com\">Embrace Potential<\/a><\/b><span> provides monthly pro bono group coaching to international students in Greater New York City.&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;This is a pro bono service.

Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through the New Age Movement. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace. Many people pay high fees for seminars to gain the skill and confidence necessary to face an audience.

As such, they do not allow others to sacrifice them. In life, we cannot ask for respect, and we cannot demand it; we must command it! Being a member of \u201cTeam Good Guys\u201d means that you have to cultivate, and maintain yourself in \u201cThe Spirit of Goodness\u201d. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to spend time with children who have cancer, and interact with them, without reflecting their cancer back to them. <br> <\/p>\n<p>This group is fee-based (pay-to-play), because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth. <br><\/p>\n<p>I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others. I want you to value yourself. Join me, and let's work to make this group great, for everyone!

Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master.

That said, Telerik gives us the opportunity to hold three different meet-ups, where you will gain an extremely high-level perspective of the NativeScript runtime; however, if demand for this meet-up is low, we will be forced to condense it into one meet-up, which will be a deep-dive on NativeScript.<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The time and place of NYC's Summer of NativeScript meet-ups will be announced in the upcoming weeks, so be sure to join to stay updated on any new information!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Below, I have attached the material used thus far for Summer of NativeScript meet-ups.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey"},"members":37,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

I thought to myself, maybe I should try Craigslist. The moment I started to comb through Craigslist for a roommate I got overwhelmed and simply gave up. I couldn't tell who was authentic or who was a bot. The first emails I sent left me bombarded with spam.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I tried two other sites that I will not mention here because it is not important but they could not deliver what I was expecting. Plus, the ritual of going back and forth instead of simply meeting and deciding within a short time and move on with my live was taking too much time. The frustration got to me and if you are here I believe you share this frustration. I have good news for you however. We can take the reins and take back control. Who says we need a third party to find you a roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This meetup will serve to find to find, professionals like yourself, &nbsp;a roommate that meets your expectations. The success of this meetup will be in direct correlation to your commitment in showing up and participating. Basically, do not waste my time as I will not waster yours.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>The format of the meetup will be the same each week and will be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>1. Pre-populated Questionnaire \u2013 You will only have to do this once and given that your criteria for a roommate does not change you won\u2019t have to do this ever again&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>2. First 10 minutes - Chat or mingle or whatever you New Yorkers want to call it.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>3. Then 20 minutes of \"algorithmically\" matching you up with a roommate. Basically, I will use the information from the questionnaire to match you up with a few people and you get to decide if you want to talk with this person or not.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4. Then another 25 minutes of you walking over and talking to someone that you think might be a great roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>5. 5 minutes wrap up. You get to hear the success stories of people who found their roommate for that session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/highres_440841330.jpeg","photo_id":440841330,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/600_440841330.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_440841330.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11996088,"name":"Alfie Walker"},"members":9,"name":"Roommate Matchup for Professionals - New York City","id":18826991,"state":"NY","urlname":"Roommate-Matchup-for-Professionals-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Alfie"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439411717000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Womens-Cycling-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are many great women's cycling groups in NYC, but this one will focus on the LBTQ community.

We don't have the luxury of wide open fields with no one around to bother. I am a member of a local aviation club, but it can take up an hour or longer each way to get there and it just isn't always practical. I like to fly small to larger airplanes as well. I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions. I have a whole series of future events and plans that I am working on but this is a simple start.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176296482,"name":"Daso"},"members":19,"name":"New York Radio Control Airplanes Meetup","id":18842509,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Radio-Control-Airplanes-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Flyers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439841130000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"flash-mobs","name":"Flash Mobs","id":25168},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"anything-and-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-do","name":"Anything and everything you've ever wanted to do.","id":56684},{"urlkey":"random-fun","name":"Random Fun","id":100994},{"urlkey":"a-little-bit-of-everything","name":"A little bit of everything","id":125692},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-adventure","name":"Spontaneous Adventure","id":169461},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-meetups","name":"Spontaneous Meetups","id":607482},{"urlkey":"any-spontaneous-fun-suggestions","name":"Any spontaneous fun suggestions!","id":1028392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Spontaneous-People\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is an experimental Meetup group for those of us who do things a bit more impromptu: we might wake up on a Saturday morning and decide to go rock climbing or hiking; or we thought we were going to have a mellow weekend but get a little restless.

I AM native to the high desert of central Mexico, of Toltec ancestry, born in the land of the Chichimeca. I recently relocated to New York from Los Angeles, CA. and I look forward to contributing sound vibration therapy as a healing art modality. I offer to guide my fellow sound alchemists into a beautiful dream through which we will all reach a zero point state of being. My intention for NY Sound Alchemy is to create a comfortable, invigorating, magical, mysterious, and healing \"sound-bath\/sound-scape\" for my guests. I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage &amp; Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal &amp; Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

To that end, we want to bridge the gaps that may jeopardize the health and vitality of this and future generations. We will use new tools to fulfill time-tested objectives. To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

We are going to try something different; we will get together, read a book of our own choosing (you must bring your own book), and afterward, each member will explain to the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. What compelled you to choose the book that you were reading.<\/p>\n<p>2. What are your learning from the book, and how are you applying it to life.<\/p>\n<p>3. Convince other members, why they should read the book. <br><\/p>\n<p>In life, you can never tell others what to read, listen to, or watch; their lives, and their desires lead them toward discovering themselves, but you can influence them, and even if they do not follow your lead immediately, they may do so in the future when the need arises. I often see people reading books, and I want to know what they are reading, and why they are reading it. What you are compelled to read, or avoid reading is a reflection of you. It not only matters that you read, what you read matters! Join me at the New York Public Library Schwarzman Building, as I sit among the tourists, and enjoy the works of the masters, and give them their due, by immersing myself in their works. At the conclusion of the 2 hours, we will share our thoughts (each member receiving 5 minutes of time, and I getting the last word before we conclude) about what we are reading, and hopefully we will be able to inspire each other. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join me, and we will travel into the minds of others, use their knowledge, and wisdom to improve ourselves, our lives, and the world that enabled us to be! <br><\/p>\n<p>I just want to warn you guys, that prior to attending this event, I will be practicing Krav Maga. Only a true badass, can practice kicking ass, and then sit down, and enjoy reading a book, while lesser men, resist reading, and want to fight. You can't do the latter without the former, or else the consequences will be severe for you!<\/p>\n<p>This group requires is fee-based (pay-to-play), because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth.<\/p>\n<p> I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others. I want you to value yourself. Join me, and let's work to make this group great, for everyone!

OUR FOCUS is LOCALISM and driving $$$ and sustainability to your business. We have a signature event called the ReMIXX every month where we feature an entrepreneur. NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities. Now is the time to join forces to protect, foster, and strengthen the local businesses in our neighborhoods that give us a sense of place, ensure our diverse culture, and provide us with strong unique communities we are proud to call home","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14366314,"name":"Karen Brown-Stovell"},"members":20,"name":"Newark Forward Ever Business Alliance Meetup","id":18889045,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Newark-Forward-Ever-Business-Alliance-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Localists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441121892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More-testing\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Tus us to nick si do belfry fleet bled Clift sm ni fb agog Cheryl varnish cleon Xbox sm bc clerk Clifty salud cl do all\u00edspey delito vi salvocorreo claro<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":151833872,"name":"Amy "},"members":1,"name":"More testing","id":18889179,"state":"NY","urlname":"More-testing","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441122327000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"spark","name":"Spark","id":360491},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"apache-spark","name":"Apache spark","id":1471442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spark-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"NYC Spark users group for those interested in distributed computing technologies.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":117500482,"name":"Matthew Hunt"},"members":340,"name":"New York Spark Meetup","id":18889202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Spark-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sparkies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441135114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223},{"urlkey":"social-philanthropy","name":"Social Philanthropy","id":113816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BE-A-FRIEND-Walkathon-2015\/","rating":0,"description":"Join friends, family members and colleagues as you walk, run or stroll along beautiful Hudson River Park in support of Samaritans 24-hour Suicide Prevention Center at our 2nd Annual BE A FRIEND 5K Walkathon, Saturday, September 19.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals! Let's travel together and not be conformed to this world BUT see the beautiful world God has created!!! There's so much out there to see and I've only touched 9% of the countries in this world.
