I'm Francesca - a 45 year old mom living in Maplewood. As a plus-sized woman, it's harder for me to find a network of like-minded women who come across the same challenges as I do in life... everything from shopping for clothes, to fitting in movie theater seats, to exercise. Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

We will have a meeting one evening soon in New York City, but as new organizers are added to this group there can be Meetups set up ANYWHERE under the NED umbrella - including cross-geography, worldwide meetings set up through a virtual conference.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10471670,"name":"Janice Dru","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/f\/highres_241591567.jpeg","photo_id":241591567,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/f\/member_241591567.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/4\/f\/thumb_241591567.jpeg"}},"members":358,"name":"Nonprofit Executive Directors (NED) Meetup","id":18401127,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nonprofit-Executive-Directors-NED-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Nonprofit Executive Directors"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422761136000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"figuredrawing","name":"Figure Drawing","id":2784},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"portrait-photography","name":"Portrait Photography","id":16613},{"urlkey":"sketching","name":"Sketching","id":16783},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"draw","name":"Drawing","id":20805},{"urlkey":"life-drawing","name":"Life Drawing","id":23981},{"urlkey":"painting-oil-acrylic-watercolor-etc","name":"Painting - Oil, Acrylic, Watercolor, etc.","id":25223},{"urlkey":"life-figure-drawing","name":"Life Figure Drawing","id":105191},{"urlkey":"face","name":"Face","id":117895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/live-portrait-drawing\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Practice capturing the depth of a human face through paint or pencil.

Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace. The experience is often sublime, and always tailored to exactly what it is that you need next in your life.

The Rethink Yoga style combines external work (postures and breath) with internal work (cultivating a yogic lifestyle, meditation, and wisdom) creating a practice that encourages students to find their personal power. Always set with an intention of practice, Dahlia\u2019s classes provide a thorough workout while encouraging students to reach out of their comfort zones mentally and physically.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/highres_243811229.jpeg","photo_id":243811229,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/member_243811229.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/thumb_243811229.jpeg"}},"members":170,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423514461000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"lunch","name":"Lunch","id":19892},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"meet-for-lunches","name":"Meet for Lunches","id":28189},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Focused-Networking-Happy-Hours-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi all!

You can expect to find a supportive and inspiring group of women here who are looking to create and live their luscious legends for the good of all. We hold regular workshops and retreats in New York City and the Hudson River Valley so we can connect in person with on-going support. We hope to spread to locations around the world. We believe if you teach a woman how to create her most pleasurable version of her life and dare to aim for her magnificent dreams, she will inspire others to do the same, thus, creating a happier healthier world.<\/p>\n<p>We delight, create, learn, dance, play and explore in nourishing nature-based programming.<\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MagneticExplorators\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MagneticExplorator...<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/e\/a\/highres_441903818.jpeg","photo_id":441903818,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/e\/a\/600_441903818.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/e\/a\/thumb_441903818.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184309099,"name":"Magnetic Explorators","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/a\/6\/highres_249474182.jpeg","photo_id":249474182,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/a\/6\/member_249474182.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/a\/6\/thumb_249474182.jpeg"}},"members":30,"name":"Magnetic Explorators","id":18423744,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Magnetic-Explorators-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Magnetic Explorators"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423524972000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"workathome","name":"Work At Home","id":589},{"urlkey":"graphicdesign","name":"Graphic Design","id":781},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"collegelife","name":"College Life","id":2887},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"recent-college-grads","name":"recent college grads","id":18778},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"college-students","name":"College Students","id":29723},{"urlkey":"virtual-freelancers","name":"Virtual Freelancers","id":57903},{"urlkey":"freelance-translation","name":"Freelance Translation","id":70037},{"urlkey":"freelance-content-writers","name":"Freelance Content Writers","id":92765},{"urlkey":"freelance-communication-marketing-professionals","name":"Freelance Communication & Marketing Professionals","id":102249},{"urlkey":"freelancer-networking","name":"Freelancer Networking","id":496242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Student-Side-Hustlers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Congratulations, you've made it to New York.

With the great advancement of technology, it is often not hard to help others in need for pay, but sometimes you need a little help figuring out what skills you can sell and how to go about it. We look to host regular Meetups bringing together students with experts that can help you reach your goals of additional money and beyond. We hope to bring business leaders, teachers, successful freelancers and much more who can help get you in the right mindset and guide you with the right tools to be more financially independent and set yourself up for beyond your years in school.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/highres_434228956.jpeg","photo_id":434228956,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/600_434228956.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/f\/c\/thumb_434228956.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184309468,"name":"Tek Kim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/7\/1\/highres_243680337.jpeg","photo_id":243680337,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/7\/1\/member_243680337.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/7\/1\/thumb_243680337.jpeg"}},"members":57,"name":"Student Side Hustlers","id":18423750,"state":"NY","urlname":"Student-Side-Hustlers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Side Hustlers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423543510000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"exchangestud","name":"International and Exchange Students","id":3451},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"international-professionals","name":"International Professionals","id":18912},{"urlkey":"career-coaching","name":"Career Coaching","id":20251},{"urlkey":"networking-for-job-seekers","name":"Networking for Job Seekers","id":21836},{"urlkey":"career-advice-career-help-interview-skills","name":"Career Advice, Career Help, Interview Skills","id":26658}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/International-Students-Professionals-Career-Development\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>Who Are We?<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Did you want to chase your dreams so that you leave everything you knew and came to the U.S.?

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/highres_66728792.jpeg","photo_id":66728792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/member_66728792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/thumb_66728792.jpeg"}},"members":181,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp;

I like to call these events \"Girl's Night Out\" because I want you to feel like you are pampered!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy teaching new techniques, stamping with my friends, and making various home decor items using rubber stamps, die cuts, and beautiful papers.  Join my monthly classes for inspiration, socialization, or to learn something new!  \n\nI have several ideas for upcoming meetups -- some will be classes where we will make several cards or a home decor item, and others will be an open house style where you can each bring your own paper crafting projects, and you can use all of my non-consumables such as punches, the Big Shot die cutting machine (and all the many dies I have), stamps, and ink.  I will provide great snacks (usually involves CHOCOLATE in one form or another) and drinks, and assist you with your creative projects.

Guest speakers working at the local, state, and federal level will be part of the group's agenda.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":36018382,"name":"Lisa Ewart","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/d\/a\/7\/highres_243932167.jpeg","photo_id":243932167,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/d\/a\/7\/member_243932167.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/d\/a\/7\/thumb_243932167.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Disaster Preparedness and Response","id":18446153,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Disaster-Preparedness-and-Response","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.8300018311,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424368510000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"php","name":"PHP","id":455},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"witi","name":"Women in Technology","id":10296},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"girl-develop-it","name":"Girl Develop It","id":358581},{"urlkey":"women-who-code","name":"Women Who Code","id":1398192}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-DevLab-Coding-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><i><b>High quality, free coding workshops and hackathons by AT&amp;T.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>We&nbsp;only hold a couple of coding workshops or hackathons in New York each year, so you won't get a lot of messages from us.

All our members know that our club is the best place you can learn communication and leadership skills in both English and Japanese. We have accomplished the \"Distinguished Toastmasters Club Award\" 5 years in a row. This award is given by Toastmasters International to the clubs that accomplished at least 5 of its specified goals. Not only is our club effective, but it is so much fun that it\u2019s addictive! Our membership is open to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills in a culturally diverse environment. We meet in mid-town Manhattan twice a month, and in each meeting, we run two sessions; first in English and then in Japanese. However, you do not need to speak Japanese and you are very welcome to participate in the English session only. Our club provides a friendly and supportive environment where you can build up confidence with each speaking assignment. By regularly presenting a speech in front of like-minded professionals, you will soon find yourself speaking in a more relaxed and confident manner to the board of directors, to your customers or even in job interviews! Feel free to join us as a guest and see for yourself how it works.

Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other.

Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.

We originated as a result of day trips into the city for a number of years to share the light of the gospel. As we made acquaintances here, they requested a church where we could meet together. We started out as a one Sunday a month Bible study and as more interest grew we became a local body of believers with church services every Sunday and some services in the week. In June of 2014 we moved a pastor into the Bronx. Our congregation consists of the two families here, two families and some youth who drive in from Pennsylvania, and a number of dedicated people from the city. A personal note from the pastor:<br>Hi there! I am Tim. I was born in 1976. My brother (my co-pastor) and I are in the middle of six children. Today of those six, two are missionaries in Honduras, two of us are involved in the church plant here in the Bronx, and two are settled in Pennsylvania. My wife and I are known in the community here in South Bronx as the family with the 5 boys. That recently changed when boy number 6 joined the family.

I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":131857822,"name":"Marthe","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/highres_242952651.jpeg","photo_id":242952651,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/member_242952651.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/6\/b\/thumb_242952651.jpeg"}},"members":130,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

Pepperdata delivers predictability, increasing performance, and visibility for business-critical Hadoop jobs on existing clusters running multiple applications. Pepperdata's software makes every Hadoop node more efficient, allowing companies to run more jobs on the existing infrastructure.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/highres_244267464.jpeg","photo_id":244267464,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/member_244267464.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/d\/2\/8\/thumb_244267464.jpeg"}},"members":543,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

[Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.

While learning Jeremy\u2019s six point ACCESS method, you will have the opportunity to practice the ACCESS method by directing actors in short movie scene rehearsals during each class.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jeremy will coach you through these rehearsals to help guide you to your vision. You will have the opportunity to observe your fellow directors working with the same scene and actors during each class in order to witness how much a director\u2019s input can radically change any scene for better or worse. And by the final class, you will select a movie scene of your choice and direct that scene rehearsal in class to implement what you have learned.<\/p>\n<p>\"Directors ACCESS&nbsp;Workshop\" is a fun and safe place to explore your craft of directing the actor while expanding your director\u2019s tool box and skill set. When a scene is not working, directors often make a misdiagnosis of where the problem emanates. This workshop is a great opportunity to discover how to correct that common mistake by learning all six points of Jeremy\u2019s ACCESS method. During the workshop you\u2019ll learn to diagnose a performance problem accurately, so the correct method of adjustment can be implemented. This workshop is open to directors of all experience levels.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/2\/6\/d\/600_435349773.jpeg\"><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/0\/f\/highres_445902511.jpeg","photo_id":445902511,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/0\/f\/600_445902511.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/0\/f\/thumb_445902511.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":60085522,"name":"Jeremy Wechter","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/f\/c\/highres_244385628.jpeg","photo_id":244385628,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/f\/c\/member_244385628.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/f\/c\/thumb_244385628.jpeg"}},"members":640,"name":"Directors Access Worshop","id":18486718,"state":"NY","urlname":"Directors-Access-Workshop","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Directing Students"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425874052000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"museum","name":"Museum","id":7319},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"walking-tours","name":"Walking Tours","id":19605},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"tours","name":"Tours","id":20754},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"art-walks-and-tours","name":"Art Walks and Tours","id":26567},{"urlkey":"historical-tours","name":"Historical Tours","id":73281},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256},{"urlkey":"museums-galleries","name":"Museums & Galleries","id":117248},{"urlkey":"arts-culture","name":"Arts & Culture","id":154787}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/5dguide\/","rating":4.84,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in exploring NYC's sights from a creative perspective.

To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment. You are different every time you walk into the room; so is the group and so is your teacher. Therefore, each class holds completely unique possibilities.

Join Us - MeetOut NYC. In-addition to the meetup events we will hold, we will use the accompanying MeetOut app (meetoutapp.com), to give you the flexibility to further connect with the people in this group. This is a free app that the organizer (me) created to help foster greater engagement within our meetup groups. We are staying true to the Meetup mission and allow our members greater collaboration among themselves based on common interests and activities. This is a Meetup group first and foremost, and we will follow all meetup guidelines and policies.

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/highres_244821015.jpeg","photo_id":244821015,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/member_244821015.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/thumb_244821015.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

You'll also learn natural running form, helping you become stronger, healthier, and more injury resistant. Look out PR's, here you come! And if you've ever been injured, mindful running will help you come back faster, with a more relaxed and super-charged body, mind and soul.

Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br><\/b><b>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English? <br>3.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

A bit about moi: in my 20s, a musician, somewhat trans and going by the name Michael, can't understand why GAY can't encompass all of us, especially queer. I consider myself a queer a a result of how I dress and interact with the gender I am attracted to. In being trans, I am particularly interested in talking with trans folk who are truly \"open\", and thus not black and white, and thus, who would be open to discussing more of our estate in being trans, and what it means, and why and what we feel.

Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month. Beginners are encouraged to come and try it out--experience not needed--and a beginners\u2019 workshop precedes the dance. Come alone, with a partner or with friends.<\/p>\n<p>In the contra community, Swingin\u2019 Tern is known both as a beginner-friendly dance group and the host of special dances that draw dancers from several states.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: The First Presbyterian Church Parish House, 14 Hanover Road, East Hanover, NJ <br>First and third Saturday every month.

In 2004, a french guy (Olivier Lafay) developed a training method that relies completely on your body weight and his method became a bestseller in the sports category in France.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The method consists of a plan to develop your muscles without using any machines, painful exercises or dedicating hours to training. The core idea is to promote steady evolution of your fitness level by increasing the intensity of the activity and let the muscles heal, rest and grow. This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!). This is all about building a cool community, meeting new people, being supportive, eating local, quality food and kicking off the weekend with some positivity. Why not avoid the brunch wait, and instead come enjoy the sun, fresh air, and good company?

These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting.

Depending on the sport of the day, one or two Dads will be responsible for keeping an eye on the kids for very short periods.  We will play with frequent substitutions to rotate playing and babysitting.

Just by showing up and paying the entry free you are supporting a local musician or band. Typically cover charges go directly to a performing act once a minimum threshold has been met by the host venue. Due to the the vast amount of venues in NYC local bands may encounter audiences that are spread very thinly from venue to venue. By forming a group we can give selected local acts eager for new fans an opportunity to play for larger audience.<br><\/p>\n<p>In the future, Rock &amp; Effect NYC will be looking to partner with local music arts charitable organizations in combination with local venues to provide fundraising opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><b>How can I join the group?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Joining is easy.

All that is necessary is a love for the Beatles and music from that rock n roll generation.","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":86466452,"name":"Marian Murray","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/f\/2\/highres_234203282.jpeg","photo_id":234203282,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/f\/2\/member_234203282.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/f\/2\/thumb_234203282.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"Yonkers The Beatles Meetup","id":18565606,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yonkers-The-Beatles-Meetup","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"Fans of the Beatles"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Westfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430146807000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"yoga-in-the-park","name":"Yoga in the Park","id":16588},{"urlkey":"outdoor-yoga","name":"Outdoor Yoga","id":22571},{"urlkey":"yoga-community","name":"Yoga Community","id":29136}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Yoga-in-the-Park-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Meditation and Healing Meetup\nWhere: Mindowaskin Park Westfile,Nj \nWhen: May 6,Thursday. 1-2:30pm\nWhat to bring: A yoga mat or a chair.\nCost:Free\n","lon":-74.3499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182866242,"name":"Reshma Shah","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/4\/highres_245701524.jpeg","photo_id":245701524,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/4\/member_245701524.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/f\/4\/thumb_245701524.jpeg"}},"members":130,"name":"Westfield Yoga in the Park Meetup","id":18565790,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Westfield-Yoga-in-the-Park-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Lightholders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430154682000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"womensports","name":"Women's Sports","id":6828},{"urlkey":"netball","name":"Netball","id":7267},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"team-sport","name":"Team Sport","id":30568},{"urlkey":"mixed-netball","name":"Mixed Netball","id":124632},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"recreational-team-sport","name":"recreational team sport","id":287161}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Netball-Meetup\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>Let's meet up and play netball all over Brooklyn.
