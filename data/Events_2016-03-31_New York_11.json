This has led to a plethora of \u2018best practices\u2019 that are painfully passed on from older to younger generations via books, lectures, consulting, blog posts, etc. Many of these \u2018best practices\u2019 must be explicitly taught, because they don\u2019t evolve naturally from object-oriented programming. Surprisingly, many of these hard-won \u2018best practices\u2019 fall naturally into place when applying functional programming. Instead of deliberate design, functional programming forms pits of success where you naturally fall into the same \u2018best practices\u2019 that you have to deliberately work for in object-oriented programming. In this session, you\u2019ll learn about a handful of such \u2018best practices\u2019, and how functional programming automatically lead you there, without your explicit effort.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><b>A Functional architecture with F#<\/b><\/p> <p><i>F# is a Functional language in the .NET framework; while most people still regard it as a niche language, it\u2019s a Turing complete, general purpose language, so you can build almost any sort of application with it. However, with its strong focus on immutability, programmers used to Object Orientation struggle with creating a proper architecture for a Functional system.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>One way to approach Functional architecture is to separate the system into abstractions for writing data, and abstractions for reading data.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>A set of design patterns collectively known as Pipes and Filters provide a model for receiving and persisting data, while a programming model known as Map\/Reduce addresses the concerns of reading (persisted) data and transforming it into useful boundary constructs.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Mark Seemann<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i>Mark Seemann helps programmers make code easier to maintain. His professional interests include functional programming, object-oriented development, software architecture, as well as software development in general. Apart from writing a book about Dependency Injection he has also created several Pluralsight courses, and written numerous articles and blog posts about programming. Originally poised to become a rock star or (failing that) graphic novelist (in the European tradition) he one day found himself with insufficient talent for either, a master\u2019s degree in Economics, and a desire for working with computers. He has been doing the latter intermittently since 1995.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/229826790\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvfbmc","time":1459290600000,"updated":1459303140000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449173781000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/6\/0\/600_445115680.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come out and play some games, hang out, have fun and may be make some new friends.<\/p> <p><br\/>Leave a comment if you are bringing any games.

Rebelling against her father\u2019s films of passion, intrigue, and spirits from beyond, Severin starts making documentaries, traveling through space and investigating the levitator cults of Neptune and the lawless saloons of Mars. For this is not our solar system, but one drawn from classic science fiction in which all the planets are inhabited and we travel through space on beautiful rockets. Severin is a realist in a fantastic universe.<\/p> <p>But her latest film, which investigates the disappearance of a diving colony on a watery Venus populated by island-sized alien creatures, will be her last. Though her crew limps home to earth and her story is preserved by the colony\u2019s last survivor, Severin will never return.<\/p> <p>Aesthetically recalling A Trip to the Moon and House of Leaves, and told using techniques from reality TV, classic film, gossip magazines, and meta-fictional narrative, Radiance is a solar system-spanning story of love, exploration, family, loss, quantum physics, and silent film.\"<\/p> <p><b>Some questions to consider while reading:<\/b><\/p> <p>The author claims, in an interview with John Scalzi, that the book has not one big idea, but six.

Does plausibility even matter in this context? Why or why not?<\/p> <p>This author frequently writes for a young adult, and sometimes younger, audience. Is that obvious that this author writes for both young and adult audiences? Does this feel like an \u201cadult\u201d novel?<\/p> <p>This book is a sort of multi-media novel in written form including, in the author\u2019s words, \u201cincluding scripts, audio, shifting POV, and the other ephemera and metafictional elements.\u201d Is this strategy successful? How do these elements contribute to or enhance the reading experience?<\/p> <p>Also, keep an eye on all the standard elements. How do the characters strike you? Do you like them? How does your impression of the characters affect your experience with the book?

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

We are setting the RSVP limit to 26 but do not be disheartened to join the \"wait-list\". \u00a0Those who RSVP\"yes\" are given a definite spot in the game if they arrive before or EXACTLY at 5:30. If you have been \"wait-listed\" and arrive before or at 5:30 and slots are open, you are given a spot. For those who do not RSVP and just show up must wait until 5:30pm and depending upon the order you showed up in and if the conditions mentioned above are not met, you will be allowed to play to make it so the teams are 13 each. If you have RSVP-ed and do not show up by the time we kick off and teams are full, you will be put aside. \u00a0for those who show up late, I will set some cones aside so you can play a smaller game against anyone else who shows up late.\u00a0If you don't show up at all and RSVP-ed \"yes\", you will be warned 3 times and after that every time I see your name on RSVP you will be put as a \"no\".

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

Dressed in black hoods, members of the secret American Protective Association (APA) practiced bizarre rituals to promote hatred and bigotry toward Irish Catholics. Although Irish Americans had dug the canals and laid the rails for the nation\u2019s infrastructure, they still labored in sweat shops at the whim of factory owners. Winning political power was their sole path to counter ruling class oppression, but Irish political success fanned resentments that could only end in violence, as it did in Troy, New York in March of 1894.<br\/>State Democrat Boss Ed Murphy, a Troy brewer, US Senator and Tammany loyalist, maintained total power by voter fraud and violence until one of his henchmen fatally shot Protestant poll-watcher Robert Ross. APA Wizard Frank Black saw how he could turn public outrage for Ross\u2019s murder to his own political advantage using an Irish scapegoat. With no knowledge of the facts, Black declared Bartholomew \u201cBat\u201d Shea the culprit, and publicly vowed to see Shea executed and Murphy dethroned. Black ran Shea\u2019s criminal prosecution behind the scenes, personally conducting witness interviews, burying inconsistent testimony and illegally advising the grand jury. Bat Shea was convicted of first degree murder and sent to the electric chair.<br\/>Three days before Shea\u2019s execution, another man confessed. The governor stayed Shea\u2019s execution to see if a new trial was warranted. Knowing that any scrutiny would expose how he railroaded Shea and thereby end his political career, Frank Black manipulated public opinion to prevent a new trial. Bartholomew Shea, a semi-literate saloon thug, met his death with courage, humility and transcendent forgiveness. Five thousand Irish millworkers followed Shea\u2019s hearse in a blinding snowstorm to lay him to rest. The day after Shea\u2019s execution, New York Republicans nominated Frank Black for governor, and that fall he won.<br\/><b>Jack Casey, attorney, songwriter and author, will bring this true American-Irish tragedy to life at the American Irish Historical Society on March 30, 2016, enhancing his talk with dramatic songs he wrote for the stage play. Casey has told the story of Bat Shea in many formats most recently completing its screenplay. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.BatShea.com\">www.BatShea.com<\/a><br\/>The Society will host a short reception with refreshments following the presentation.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Students: Free<br\/>General Admission: $10<br\/>Register here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-trial-of-bat-shea-a-jack-casey-lecture-with-music-tickets-20950083263?ref=ebtnebregn\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-trial-of-bat-shea-a-jack-casey-lecture-with-music-tickets-20950083263?ref=ebtnebregn\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-trial-of-bat-shea-a-jack-casey-lecture-with-music-tickets-20950083263?ref=ebtnebregn<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Lectures-Conversations\/events\/229572177\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"THE TRIAL OF BAT SHEA: A Lecture with Music - MLC Host: Mila","id":"229572177","time":1459377000000,"updated":1459389214000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367970596000,"name":"\"Manhattan Lectures & Conversations\"","group_lon":-74,"id":8392492,"urlname":"Manhattan-Lectures-Conversations","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Life-long Learners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10016","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"99 Madison Ave., 15th Floor","name":"ThoughtWorks","lon":-73.985008,"id":7502862,"state":"NY","lat":40.74472,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.449668556452,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452189586000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WHAT WE DO<\/p> <p>Open space for artists &amp; technologists to get hands-on with new technology.

A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other.

Dressed in black hoods, members of the secret American Protective Association (APA) practiced bizarre rituals to promote hatred and bigotry toward Irish Catholics. Although Irish Americans had dug the canals and laid the rails for the nation\u2019s infrastructure, they still labored in sweat shops at the whim of factory owners. Winning political power was their sole path to counter ruling class oppression, but Irish political success fanned resentments that could only end in violence, as it did in Troy, New York in March of 1894.<br\/>State Democrat Boss Ed Murphy, a Troy brewer, US Senator and Tammany loyalist, maintained total power by voter fraud and violence until one of his henchmen fatally shot Protestant poll-watcher Robert Ross. APA Wizard Frank Black saw how he could turn public outrage for Ross\u2019s murder to his own political advantage using an Irish scapegoat. With no knowledge of the facts, Black declared Bartholomew \u201cBat\u201d Shea the culprit, and publicly vowed to see Shea executed and Murphy dethroned. Black ran Shea\u2019s criminal prosecution behind the scenes, personally conducting witness interviews, burying inconsistent testimony and illegally advising the grand jury. Bat Shea was convicted of first degree murder and sent to the electric chair.<br\/>Three days before Shea\u2019s execution, another man confessed. The governor stayed Shea\u2019s execution to see if a new trial was warranted. Knowing that any scrutiny would expose how he railroaded Shea and thereby end his political career, Frank Black manipulated public opinion to prevent a new trial. Bartholomew Shea, a semi-literate saloon thug, met his death with courage, humility and transcendent forgiveness. Five thousand Irish millworkers followed Shea\u2019s hearse in a blinding snowstorm to lay him to rest. The day after Shea\u2019s execution, New York Republicans nominated Frank Black for governor, and that fall he won.<br\/>Jack Casey, attorney, songwriter and author, will bring this true American-Irish tragedy to life at the American Irish Historical Society on March 30, 2016, enhancing his talk with dramatic songs he wrote for the stage play. Casey has told the story of Bat Shea in many formats most recently completing its screenplay. www.BatShea.com<br\/>The Society will host a short reception with refreshments following the presentation.<\/p> <p>Students: Free<br\/>General Admission: $10<br\/>Register here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-trial-of-bat-shea-a-jack-casey-lecture-with-music-tickets-20950083263?ref=ebtnebregn\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-trial-of-bat-shea-a-jack-casey-lecture-with-music-tickets-20950083263?ref=ebtnebregn<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Walks-and-Talks\/events\/229847427\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"THE TRIAL OF BAT SHEA: A Lecture with Music","id":"229847427","time":1459377000000,"updated":1459389242000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1410371238000,"name":"NYC Walks and Talks","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":16918472,"urlname":"NYC-Walks-and-Talks","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Local History Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1412 Broadway, 22 Floor","name":"Grind Broadway","lon":-73.986649,"id":14241652,"state":"NY","lat":40.753639,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":0.306953161955,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454188233000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/d\/3\/600_446807315.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Topic Maps At Work. the Next Generation<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Topic maps applications are different from mainstream semantic web applications because they also enable users to define the semantics of their navigation, rather than simply relying on automated algorithms to guess what the content is about.

A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two.

Whenever I have visitors in from out of town, this place is on the top of my list to show off the great restaurants in my hood. The food is always flavorful and the portions are monstrous. I always have leftovers which I'm not mad about! Huge fan of the curry soy ramen (chicken broth) and the chili ramen. Both have excellent flavor profiles. Heat but with flavor, so you aren't getting a spice bomb that just knocks out all of your taste buds. The buns are a great way to start. And whatever tempura veggie they have feature, just get it.<\/p> <p>They have an awesome sake selection as well. Check it out. They are an amazing addition to the UES restaurant scene.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>MENU:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/naparat.wix.com\/meijintemporary#!ramen\/cee5\"><a href=\"http:\/\/naparat.wix.com\/meijintemporary#!ramen\/cee5\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/naparat.wix.com\/meijintemporary#!ramen\/cee5<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Japanese Style Curry with Fried Chicken and Rice\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/478f6b_5fde0444c7d2400e8d7544e943baec61.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_979,h_340,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01\/478f6b_5fde0444c7d2400e8d7544e943baec61.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Beef Broth Spicy Chili: Ground beef, bean sprout, arugula, bamboo, naruto, green onion, garlic chips, sesame, chili pepper, chili oil<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/G-hG6P7qdtVk6d61dzuUDA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Crispy Sesame Chicken Don<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Yhs8lPxuCets3SUXNJwNSw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Chicken Broth Soy: Braised pork, bean sprout, arugula, bamboo, naruto, green onion, egg, sesame<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/vdc1hVZoDB89Z0oBaducNw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Tuna TarTar<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/tcFCdWn0MPh5oOY7MD7yUA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Yuzu CheeseCake<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/A5tnyrieCx6tWMprH4Bq3w\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Dining Room<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/7i3OjYR0rFp4RC_2_7Tf3A\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The Bar &amp; Kitchen<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/MlazGdVW04gPxvQrjy8lBQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Inside Dining Room<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/x0Tc5eF_efUXnSWSvqXUdw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mei-jin-ramen-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mei-jin-ramen-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mei-jin-ramen-new-york<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Whether you are looking to connect with a loved one who has recently passed or to receive messages from spirit, our group offers a warm and friendly environment to all who are interested. Before each s\u00e9ance we begin our group with a 15 minute lesson on psychic development, covering topics from psychic impressions to spirit communication. We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours. The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20. Please be timely, because we do not open our doors once we begin our meditation (for obvious reasons :).
