Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIn the opening pages of Jamie Ford's stunning debut novel,\u00a0<b>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet<\/b>, Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle's Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol.<\/p> <p>\n\nThis simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry's world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While \"scholarshipping\" at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship - and innocent love - that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept.<\/p> <p>Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel's dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family's belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice - words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago.<\/p> <p>Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history,\u00a0Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\u00a0is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope.

It is Ethics applied to a group of people, and discusses how a society should be set up and how one should act within a society. Individual rights (such as the right to life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness, free speech, self-defence, etc) state explicitly the requirements for a person to benefit rather than suffer from living in a society.\u00a0 Political philosophy asks questions like: \"What is a government?\", \"Why are governments needed?\", \"What makes a government legitimate?\", \"What rights and freedoms should a government protect?\", \"What duties do citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any?\" and \"When may a government be legitimately overthrown, if ever?\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophybasics.com\/branch_political.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>From the Enlightenment \u2026\u00a0 These theorists were driven by two basic questions:<\/p> <p>(1)\u00a0 By what right or need do people form states?<\/p> <p>(2)\u00a0 What is the best form for a state?<\/p> <p>These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \"state\" and \"government.\" \u00a0It was decided that:<\/p> <p>(1)\u00a0 \"state\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified.<\/p> <p>(2)\u00a0 \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound.<\/p> <p>Much of the definitional material seems to focus on institutions and their structures.\u00a0 I would suggest that these are pretty well established in the US, and much of the world, and not likely to change much, no matter how much we complain.\u00a0 I would also suggest that what we citizens spend most of our political effort on is \u201cpolitical discourse\u201d, and that much of our complaining stems from problems relating directly to that political discourse.\u00a0 With those propositions I would offer the following as the operative question for the meetup\u2026<\/p> <p><b>Where does political discourse end and political philosophy begin?<\/b><\/p> <p>Proceeding from this question, the proposed strategy for the discussion is to perform a deconstructionist analysis of the elements of our political discourse using the basics of philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics) to gain a better understanding of the nature and content of political discourse, both as we, and our political leaders(?) practice it.<\/p> <p><b>The analytical tools\/framework of philosophy\u2026<\/b><\/p> <p>a.\u00a0 \u00a0Metaphysics \u2013 Whether an entity exists, or possibly exist;

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

Let's go!!!<\/p> <p>\"Becoming an Outdoors-Woman\" (BOW) offers outdoor skills workshops, specifically for women 18 years of age and older, although men are welcome to participate. The workshops enable women to learn about a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities in a casual, non-threatening environment. The classes are designed to be as hands-on as possible, giving participants enough knowledge to further pursue their interests once the workshop is over.<\/p> <p>Weekend workshops begin with lunch on Friday and end with lunch on Sunday. Women who register for the weekend, are given their choice of over 30 classes in which to participate. Class offerings may include: outdoor photography, stream ecology, turkey and deer hunting, fly fishing, hiking, kayaking, outdoor survival skills, and many more.<\/p> <p>In addition to weekend workshops, we are also offering Beyond BOW events. Beyond BOW workshops last from one to three days but are focused on specific activities. Beyond BOW workshops may include a 2-day canoe trip down the Potomac River with an overnight camp out , a 1-day fishing clinic, or an outdoor survival skills weekend. Each workshop we offer is tailored to showcase the resources and opportunities available in that area.<\/p> <p>The emphasis of BOW and Beyond BOW is on the enjoyment and camaraderie that goes along with outdoor recreation, whether hunting, fishing, hiking, or boating.<\/p> <p>All of this for only $195.00.

No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life \u2013 thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious. As the heart grows, so does the love, and so does our ability to experience lasting happiness in all areas of our lives.\u201d Mehrdad Mizani<\/p> <p>To see a sample of Mehrdad's talk, go to the following links:<a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Below Mehrdad on Jordan Rich show....delightful<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Way-of-Heart\/events\/225326867\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Attitude Makes All The Difference...Chat with Mehrdad","id":"dbfvpgytnbvb","time":1445639400000,"updated":1445651371000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1343498654000,"name":"The Way of Heart ~ Life, Relationships, Music, Food & More!","group_lon":-77.0100021362,"id":4413292,"urlname":"The-Way-of-Heart","group_lat":39.0200004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Mount Airy","address_1":"102 S Main Street, Lower Level","name":"Mt Airy Arts Alliance Gallery","lon":-76.701248,"id":24043447,"state":"MD","lat":38.952724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.75548172,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442943000000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We have moved our Song Circle to 6:30 PM this time, because SuperFoods - upstairs - is having an Open Mic starting at 8 PM.

To find a way, or to practice a method, implies inhibiting, controlling, suppressing thought, which is not to understand the mind. It is fairly obvious that the mind does create disease in the physical organism. If you eat when your angry, your stomach is upset. If you violently hate somebody, you have a physical disorder. If you restrict your mind to a particular belief, you become mentally or psychically neurotic, and it reacts upon the body. This all part of the psychosomatic process. Of course, not all diseases are psychosomatic, but fear, anxiety, and other disturbances of the psyche do produce physical diseases. So is it possible for the mind to be made healthy? Many of us are concerned with keeping the body healthy through right diet, and so on; which is essential, but very few are concerned with keeping the mind healthy, young, alert, vital, so that it does not deteriorate.<\/p> <p>\u201cNow, if the mind is not to deteriorate, it must obviously never follow; it must be independent, free. But our education does not help us to be free. On the contrary, it helps us to fit into this deteriorating society. Therefore the mind itself deteriorates. We are encouraged from childhood to be fearful, competitive, to think always about ourselves and our own security. Naturally, such a mind must be in everlasting conflict, and that conflict does produce physical effects. What is important, then, is to discover and understand for ourselves, through our own vigilant watchfulness, the whole process of conflict and not depend on any psychologist or guru. To follow a guru is to destroy your mind. You follow him because you want what you think he has; therefore you set going a process of deterioration. The effort to be somebody, mundanely or spiritually, is another form of deterioration, because such effort always brings anxiety; it produces fear, frustration, making the mind unhealthy, which in turn affects the body. I think this is fairly simple. But to look to another for the cure of the mind is part of the process of deterioration.\u201d<i>The Collected Works of J. Krishnamurti, vol. IX.

After a Q&amp;A period we spend two hours photographing the birds of prey.\u00a0The raptors are controlled, but they are not trained. The handlers place the birds on a natural perch. It is our job to compose an image that minimizes the view of the birds\u2019 jesses and that, more importantly, captures a good expression.

It's a well-maintained, wooded trail. The end, when approaching Weverton Cliffs is rocky - Weverton Cliffs is a rocky outcropping. The one mile walk from the cliffs to the parking lot entails numerous switchbacks, but downhill.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As each group finishes the hike, they'll head over to Big Cork Vineyards.

Then, reward yourself with lunch and some wine tasting at a new, local vineyard a few miles away! It's all about balance. :)<\/p> <p><b>Hiking<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll meet at Gathland State Park near Burkittsville, MD for our hiking portion of the day. The Appalachian Trail stretches from Maine to Georgia, it runs more than 2,175 miles along the one of the oldest mountain chains in the world. Although only a small percentage (about 40 miles) runs through Maryland, it is arguably among the most scenic portions, with monuments dotting the trail.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/a\/7\/600_441646247.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The trail runs through Gathland State Park, once owned by Civil War correspondent George Alfred Townsend (whose nickname was Gath). There he built a journalists' memorial, a castle-like arch listing the names of reporters killed during the war listed on it. Updated plaques around the park include the names of American journalists who have died covering wars around the world.<\/p> <p>The 6-mile hike follows the Appalachian Trail south along the top of the mountain. The hike has a moderate rating for its length, but it is mostly flat with few rocky patches and nearly continuous views of the valleys below. The real treat on this hike is Weverton Cliffs, where you can take in the absolutely beautiful 180 degree panoramic view of the Potomac River as it snakes between Maryland and Virginia, with the Harpers Ferry area just visible at the very western point.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/b\/e\/600_441646270.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Note this is a one-way hike so we'll need to coordinate beforehand to leave a few cars at the end point, i.e., Weverton Cliffs, so we can get everyone back to the start point and to head to the winery (just a few miles away).<\/p> <p><b>Winery<\/b><\/p> <p>After our morning hike, we're off to Big Cork Vineyards for eats and wine tasting!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/d\/c\/600_441646300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Big Cork is nestled on 100 rolling acres in Maryland\u2019s Pleasant Valley with 13 varietals, making Big Cork the second largest vineyard in Washington County. The winery and tasting room opened a few years ago. Big Cork Co-Owner Dave Collins, formerly vineyard manager and winemaker at the award-winning Breaux Vineyards (VA), oversee the planting and on-going operations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Where encampments of Union and Confederate troops once mustered during the Civil War, bountiful fruit now grows. Bog Cork\u2019s idyllic microclimate and fertile soil yield smaller grapes with more concentrated fruits, resulting in more flavorful and aromatic wines.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As a commitment to sustaining the land, the owners are mindful of farming practices and use strategies that help improve the fine quality of the wines and create a better place to live and work.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since its launch, Big Cork has won numerous awards in multiple wine competitions. The latest awards were just last year in 2014 an, included Best of Class for the 2013 Traminette at the Long Beach Grand Cru, Double Gold for the 2013 Russian Kiss at the Indy International Wine Competition, and Best in Show for the \u201cBest Dessert\u201d Vidal Ice at the Maryland Governor\u2019s Cup.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Summary<\/b><\/p> <p>Morning hike on the Appalachian Trail at Gathland State Park, afternoon eats &amp; drinks at Big Cork Vineyards.

Men, women and children compete equally with skill and horsemanship determining the class.<\/p> <p>Jousting tournaments in Maryland are \"ring tournaments\" which involve charging a horse at full-gallop through an 80-yard course toward suspended rings. Using a long, fine-tipped lance, the rider has 8 seconds to complete the course and \"spear\" the rings, scoring points accordingly.<\/p> <p>In a jousting ring tournament, rings are hung 6 feet 9 inches above the ground from three equally-spaced arches (rings range in diameter from one-quarter inch to nearly two inches depending upon the skill-level of the contestant).

Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>Here's a synopsis taken from Amazon so you know what the book is about:\u00a0Does the love for a wife and the jealousy of an infant, warrant murder? After ten years of bad dates and worse relationships, Stan is in heaven, for he has finally found his soul mate, Erica\u2014a beautiful, caring woman who shares all his beliefs, to include not wanting children. They discussed this over bottles of red wine the night they met and promised, if ever they became a couple, they would remain childless and forever the other\u2019s priority. One year after being married, Erica tells Stan she\u2019s pregnant: news she\u2019s very happy about. Stan considers talking Erica out of it, but that would mean aborting her child, something he knows Erica would never do. Two months into the pregnancy, Stan notices changes: times he and Erica enjoyed as a fun-loving childless couple are no longer; Erica\u2019s attention is occupied with all things related to the forthcoming baby, and Stan has gone without sex for months. The child arrives and things get even worse; Stan feels like an outsider: a stranger living among his wife and her son. Erica gives all her time, attention and love to the infant, leaving none for her husband. Stan becomes envious; he looks at the newborn as a threat, tells himself something must be done\u2014but what? He fights his jealous thoughts, knowing horrible things would happen if he were ever to act on them. But one night while drunk, Stan attempts to make love to his wife but is once again rejected. His pride hurt and feeling disowned, Stan stumbles into the baby\u2019s room with intentions of eliminating his problem once and for all, knowing there can only be one man in Erica\u2019s life. That is the promise his wife had made him on the night they met, and it is the promise he intends to make her keep.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/20-30s-African-American-Book-and-Writing-Club\/events\/225805763\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"1st read for the book club: My Wife's Baby: I am not a Murderer by RM Johnson","id":"225805763","time":1445713200000,"updated":1445725093000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443879865000,"name":"20-30s African American Book and Writing Club","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18991616,"urlname":"20-30s-African-American-Book-and-Writing-Club","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":16.9844417572,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444096555000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Woohoo!

It's a FREE and creative, family-friendly festival where people wear colorful costumes, make elaborate lanterns, and participate in activities during the afternoon. As it gets dark, they form a parade at 7:00 pm to march around the park, light up their custom homemade lanterns, and float them on the lake with much revelry.<\/p> <p>Like Artscape and the Kinetic Sculpture Race, this is one of the featured \"Baltimore's Best\" events that's a unique spectacle. The residents of Baltimore's neighborhoods really get into doing these events. Their costumes are terrific and it's always a hoot watching and marching with them.

(maybe even some voice) You will either sit comfortably or lie on the floor and just be. All you need do is relax and listen and let your body feel the vibrations. You will feel rejuvenated and uplifted. See my webpage for a list of benefits of sound healing.\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Sound-Healing.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Sound Healing is an effective and proven modality that uses vibrational sound to help reduce stress, alter consciousness and create a deep sense of peace, well being and better health. Sound tools entrain the brain to move into the deeper Alpha and Theta brain wave frequencies. These are the frequencies that induce deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition. Sound frequency impacts the sympathetic nervous system as your brain waves synchronize to the sound vibrations. The harmonic vibrations engage the relaxation reflex and slow down the respiratory, brain and heart rate and disrupt the pain reflex. Modern medicine can now measure and confirm the practice of sound as a means to promote healing. Thus, sound is a type of energy medicine that creates the sacred space in which people can heal the body, mind and spirit.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a donation based event.

Our village is named Revel Grove, and is set on a beautiful 25-acre wooded site with 85 acres of free parking. The village consists of craft and food booths, five pubs, ten major stages, a Jousting Arena and lots of games.<\/p> <p>Every day is a Festival Day in Revel Grove, in honor of a visit by Henry VIII and his Royal Court. As such, the village will have entertainment, crafts, food, and frivolity fit for a king!<\/p> <p>The gates open at 10:00 am, but you'll want to start the day with the King's Welcome outside the front gate at 9:45am. Once inside the gates, you may want to check your program for a listing of all the shows, but part of the fun of our Renaissance Festival is taking your time to stroll through the lanes and let the experience unfold before you.<\/p> <p>Pause for a moment to listen to a musician. Watch a demonstration of glass blowing. Quench your thirst with a mug of ale and whet your appetite with a gigantic turkey leg. Pick up the latest gossip from the fishmonger. Thrill to the combat joust and then browse through the wares at one of the many fine craft booths. There's too much to do in a single day!<\/p> <p>Performers from across the North America entertain on the Festival's many stages while the streets and woods are filled with characters to amuse and delight. Watch authentic jousting in full armor, listen to music and choral groups, thrill at jugglers, magicians, and comely wenches. Our streets and stages are filled with nonstop entertainment for all ages.<\/p> <p>While jousting takes place on every day of the Festival, on this special weekend we have knights across the country join our Free Lancers jousting company in a special competition to determine who is the greatest knight in the land!<\/p> <p><br\/>------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Maryland designated jousting as the official state sport in 1962. Jousting tournaments have been held in Maryland since early colonial times and became increasingly popular after the Civil War.<\/p> <p>Retaining the pageantry and customs of medieval tournaments, modern competitors are called \"knights\" or \"maids,\" and many dress in colorful costumes. Men, women and children compete equally with skill and horsemanship determining the class.<\/p> <p>Jousting tournaments in Maryland are \"ring tournaments\" which involve charging a horse at full-gallop through an 80-yard course toward suspended rings. Using a long, fine-tipped lance, the rider has 8 seconds to complete the course and \"spear\" the rings, scoring points accordingly.<\/p> <p>In a jousting ring tournament, rings are hung 6 feet 9 inches above the ground from three equally-spaced arches (rings range in diameter from one-quarter inch to nearly two inches depending upon the skill-level of the contestant). A family sport, jousting skills frequently are passed from one generation to the next.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Go-Out-and-Do-Something-B-GODS\/events\/225857972\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":33300000,"name":"Rennfest State Sport Weekend!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north.

But as always keep the end user's (you or the clients) opinion the highest weight in that balance.<\/p> <p>In this workshop our goal is to provoke emotions and thought with \"Subject, Composition, Light, and Exposure\" for that wonderful shot. With all good results planning is needed to increase our shot success ratio. Many items make up a good image and it all starts with good communication, spiritually within the artist (don't shoot until you see it) and verbally with your subject.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our featured model will be the crazy funny Chakira, new to the The DMV Photographer Workshops but not new to some of us. Of course we will other models depending on participation. (And if the ladies sign up we will include a male model of course.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will create the scene, but the focus will be on \"parts\" of the model in the scene. (Again composition is key!) In some \"parts\" assignments photographers work with known viewers fetishes to bring out and provoke emotion for the art viewer; legs, shoes, hands, garters, handcuffs, rope, and so on. Some of these scenes will be done in our studio and outside to help give the final image the look and feel you were looking for. Then we will move into full scene story telling views, if time permits.<\/p> <p><br\/>So, here is another workshop opportunity to broaden your shooting selections while you work on becoming one with your creative balance.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/225996196\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride (MEETING AT THE ICE HOUSE)","id":"rdfpglytnbkc","time":1445981400000,"updated":1446036346000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules brokered under this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with Aviation Velo for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research.<\/p> <p>Speaker<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/pracherla9\">Pavan Racherla<\/a>\u00a0has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on \u201cThe Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.\u201d He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]).

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

The report does\u00a0notinclude detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants. For in-depth learning through classes or workshops on foraging, processing, cooking, or medicine making with wild plants, please visit Charm City Farm's other programming.<\/p> <p>The report runs March 18- Dec 16, for a total of 40 issues. Subscribers can join at any time throughout the year. Subscription is $10 per email address.<\/p> <p>The Charm City Farms Forage Report is authored by Victoria Greba, a Baltimore based nature instructor specializing in the use of wild plants.<\/p> <p>To view a sample report and to subscribe please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/0\/0\/event_435870720.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a weekly email subscription.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Charm-City-Farms\/events\/225998341\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"The Forage Report","id":"kldhglytnblc","time":1446044400000,"updated":1446057741000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1371868523000,"name":"Charm City Farms","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":9036002,"urlname":"Charm-City-Farms","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Friendly earth people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":15.3214464188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1268852545000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet once a week with other local beadwork artists to work on and discuss new beading techniques.

It supports highly configurable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of NiFi's key features include a web-based user interface for monitoring and controlling data flows, guaranteed delivery, data provenance, and easy extensibility through custom processor development.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These features make NiFi a perfect candidate for building production quality data pipelines that interact with Apache Solr. This talk will demonstrate how to use a NiFi processor that delivers data to a Solr update handler, as well as a processor for extracting data from Solr on regular intervals for delivery to down-stream systems. In addition we will show how these processors can be combined with other built-in NiFi processors to solve a variety of use cases,\u00a0including log aggregation, and indexing messages received from Kafka.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p><i>Speaker Bio<\/i><\/p> <p>Bryan Bende is a Software Engineer at Hortonworks where he develops dataflow capabilities around the core framework of Apache NiFi.

Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America.

Looking forward to some Pre-Halloween fun :-)<\/p> <p>**Note: I limited the attendee count to 10 so we would have a small group on the hike, but if you still want to participate in Greene Turtle portion, you are more than welcome to meet us there at 10pm.**<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Black-Young-Professionals\/events\/225396566\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"Haunted History Hike","id":"225396566","time":1446246000000,"updated":1446290461000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1406905627000,"name":"Black Young Professionals of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":16121932,"urlname":"Black-Young-Professionals","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"BYPs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"1721 Reisterstown Rd.

Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh\u2019s musings on the shape of a woman\u2019s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.<\/p> <p>With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55\/events\/224995255\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's Read & Discuss a Book:  A Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh","id":"224995255","time":1446388200000,"updated":1446415224000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422713755000,"name":"Towson Area Inquisitive Women over 55","group_lon":-76.5800018311,"id":18398926,"urlname":"Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55","group_lat":39.4099998474,"who":"Curious women over 55."},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"In Nature","address_1":"Outside","name":"www.CharmCityFarms.org","lon":0,"id":23627592,"state":"MD","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.82481098175,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438314530000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>*** Please follow this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/acorn-processing\/\">link<\/a> to register for this workshop.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

The mind that is malleable is the mind that is powerful.<\/p> <p>In religious science we speak of the promise of the \u201cEternality of the Human Soul\u201d. What is this promise? Simply put in the words of Ernest Holmes:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe Believe in the eternality, the immortality, and the continuity of the individual soul, forever and ever expanding.\u201d<\/p> <p>When we look at life in this way we see that time and space is no limiter of the human soul. In fact, if we are an ever evolving emanation of God then we can easily accept that whatever transition we may ever face, even death, can be viewed in an almost unrecognizable blip on our eternal timeline.<\/p> <p>All the sages of all the ages have agreed that the human soul is something that is not a thing at all. It goes on and on and never ends. It is simply the constant variant that is carried over from one transition to the next, whatever they may be.<\/p> <p>While we never claim to know what these transitions are or what lay beyond them, we acknowledge that it is consistent to believe that we continue to expand in consciousness and as such, there is no transition that will ever be the \u201cend\u201d of our soul.<\/p> <p>Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers, Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\u00a0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/7\/4\/600_422410612.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"6175 Sunny Spring, Columbia, MD 21044","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living\/events\/226258345\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":4500000,"name":"Sunday Experience","id":"226258345","time":1446390000000,"updated":1446402025000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412102441000,"name":"Columbia Center for Spiritual Living","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":17316882,"urlname":"Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21201","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"306 W Franklin St","name":"Baltimore Ethical Society","lon":-76.62037,"id":489553,"state":"MD","lat":39.294926,"repinned":false},"headcount":30,"distance":0.34152123332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445945214000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Melissa Rock, Child Welfare Director, AYC<\/p> <p><br\/>Ms. Rock\u2019s talk will be about how Advocates for Children and Youth improves outcomes for Maryland's foster youth through policy advocacy.

There is no park sign. \u00a0Continue on Bayberry and look for the lower meadow entrance further down on the right.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Rental kayaks, including a paddle and PFD will be available at the rate of $55.00 for the day. \u00a0You must answer the rental question when you RSVP to reserve one.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/226119691\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride (MEETING AT THE ICE HOUSE)","id":"rdfpglytpbfb","time":1446589800000,"updated":1446642286000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules brokered under this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with Aviation Velo for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended.

As a child, dad was constantly taking photos of the family, nature and later in life work. I was usually in front of the camera. I never really had an interest in creating images until I began to travel, even though I was an art student in different medias, at Maryland Institute College of Art. I took my first photography workshop in 1997 with John and Barbara Gerlach. I received the suggested list of gear to have in order to maximize the experience and shortly realized I was in over my head. What the heck was a spot meter? So I did some quick research and purchased a Nikon N90S.<br\/>I decided to take the digital leap in 2006, after having the experience of using Nikon's slide scanner and working a little in Photoshop.I bought my first Mac in 2004 and I was ready to take the plunge. I enjoy being behind the viewfinder where every other thought in the world disappears, trying to capture the most beautiful images possible. My articles and images have been published in Nature Photographer Magazine, iPhoneLife Magazine, Maryland Department of Natural Resources Calendar and in the Maryland Wine Association News.<\/p> <p>In 2008 I decided to give the Photo biz a try, with my first Gallery Show. I have subsequently had images displayed in the Rehoboth Art League, and The Seaford Historical Museum; in support of the Smithsonian Museum's traveling show \"Fences\". Currently I have images on display at Baas Art Gallery In Seattle WA. I teach privately, as well as conduct field workshops. I am an instructor at Johns Hopkins University in the Odyssey Program, I lead workshops and lecture for Capital Photography Center in Washington DC.

This is a small group of people who meet regularly - typically every two weeks. The purposes of such a group would be a) to help develop more a sense of community, b) to deepen your practice of meditation and encourage more consistent practice, and c) to start integrating Buddhist ideas and principles into your daily life.<\/p> <p>I can't stress enough how beneficial being part of such a group can be. I have witnessed and experienced substantial transformations in myself and in the members of my KM groups as we have wrestled with different Buddhist ideas. And I now have groups of people that I know well and can call on when I need to.<\/p> <p>The structure of a typical KM group is as follows: Silent or guided meditation, followed by a brief check-in of how members are feeling or of significant events, followed by a reading or talk (prepared by the leader of the day) and a discussion of the reading, followed by any announcements and group decisions and a closing. Please know that the KM groups are not a substitution for the Tuesday evening class. This class will continue to run in conjunction with the KM groups.

If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

Old forts are very cool. (That's fOrts. FOrts.)<\/b><\/p> <p>Fort Carroll is an abandoned, pre-Civil War era, hexagonal structure that sits on an island in the middle of the Patapsco River. You can see it when driving over the Key Bridge on I-695. The only way you can get to it is by boat. It was built by Robert E Lee. It's named after Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. It's historical. It's cool.

Carroll. Built in the late 1800's, it was part of the series of forts designed to protect the important Port of Baltimore (Ft Carroll, Ft. Howard and Ft. McHenry were all part of this system.) Speaking of Fort McHenry, (George) Armistead was the commander there during the war of 1812.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/b\/0\/600_437666288.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ft. Armistead is historical, but it's hard to call it \"cool\". It's been abandoned for a long time and no one (read: City of Baltimore) takes care of it. It's totally trashy, the buildings are graffiti-covered (although some very good graffiti), there is drug dealing, and it is a cruising\u00a0mecca. \u00a0So it's a little creepy, but still very interesting.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/0\/3\/600_437666371.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/0\/7\/600_437666375.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Ft. Armistead<\/i><\/p> <p>Here's the plan:<\/p> <p>We'll meet at the Hard Yacht Caf\u00e9 which is on Bear Creek. It's a kayaker-friendly place, with a couple of kayak-specific launching docks.\u00a0The food and drink is pretty good. I mean any place that has what's advertised as a \"Big Ass Steak\" has got to be OK, right? They also have live music on Saturday afternoon and evening.<\/p> <p>The paddle out to Ft. Carroll is only a couple of miles. After hanging out there, we'll head over to Ft Armistead (another mile or so), land on a little beach and walk around to see the buildings where the gun batteries were placed.<\/p> <p>The whole trip is only 7.5 NM but I suspect it will take 4-5 hours after checking out the forts and taking a break.\u00a0 We can add some miles if people want by paddling to either: 1) the abandoned steel mill complex at Sparrow's Point or 2) the industrial\/shipping area around Curtis Bay.<\/p> <p>Even though it's a fairly short paddle, it is pretty serious. There is a lot of boat traffic on the Patapsco, including gigantic freighters. This is the main channel connecting the Chesapeake Bay with the Baltimore Harbor. The boats can generate significant wake and waves. The channel is way more dangerous than Ft. Armistead.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements<\/b><\/p> <p>Therefore: you have to have a 15+ foot boat that is yours and that you know how to handle. It has to have fore and aft bulkheads. You\u00a0have to wear a spray skirt and be totally comfortable doing wet exits. You need to be a strong enough paddler that you can keep up with the group all the time. And you absolutely have to stay with the group when we are doing the crossings.<\/p> <p><b>NOTE: The cold water requirement is in effect!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/9\/3\/600_437666771.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures\/events\/226333351\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":21600000,"name":"Baltimore's Fort Carroll and Fort Armistead","id":"226333351","time":1446908400000,"updated":1446997693000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1320709784000,"name":"Chesapeake Kayak Adventures","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":2775772,"urlname":"Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures","group_lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Chesapeake Paddlers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"101 W Fayette St","name":"Baltimore Harbor Hotel","lon":-76.617104,"id":23638130,"lat":39.289883,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.155752822757,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425905307000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you want to help our homeless?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Every first Saturday, join The LACC Foundation in their effort to provide the homeless with essential food, clothes, hygiene supplies and a kind word.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meet at Baltimore Harbor Hotel at.

After the meditation session we discuss the meditation experience, and also take in select readings from a variety of meditation masters.
