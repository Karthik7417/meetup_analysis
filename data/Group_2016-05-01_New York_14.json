Let's help each other to make space and time to create the life we want to live by decluttering, curating, and editing your life to a life that you would be proud of. (Plus, a life that is more sustainable &amp; environmentally friendly via minimalism) This group is for support, inspiration, and motivation!<\/p>\n<p>Here people who deal with issues such as minimalist lifestyle, sustainability and reduced consumption meet. The 5 Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle are an important part of the way of thinking in everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup group in New York City will host meetings in all 5 boroughs for everyone who wants to discover, learn more or share their experiences with minimalism. Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what adds value to their lives. By clearing the clutter from life's path, we can all make room for the most important aspects of life: health, relationships, passion, growth, and contribution. There are many flavors of minimalism: a twenty-year-old single guy's minimalist lifestyle looks different from a forty-five-year-old mother's minimalist life. Even though everyone embraces minimalism differently, each path leads to the same place: a more purposeful and deliberate life.<\/p>\n<p>If this speaks to you, join in the upcoming conversations! You can attend by yourself or bring a friend\/partner!<\/p>\n<p>An introduction to minimalism starts here: <br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theminimalists.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.theminimalists.com\/<\/a> <br><a href=\"http:\/\/theminimalists.com\/podcast\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/theminimalists.com\/podcast<\/a> <br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iKhQ75DfD2k\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iKhQ75DfD2k<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NewYorkCityMinimalismGroup\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NewYorkCityMinimalismGroup\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/464826070394574\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/464826070394574\/<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this group, it is not about to reach a consensus or to solve the problems of the world.

This new method of individual transformation through awakening of inner energy, Sahaja Yoga Meditation could very well be the solution to resolve all the crises and serious problems our modern world is presently experiencing. Sahaja meditation is a next step into human evolution. When we were evolved from Amoeba to humans, we were not aware of it. In order to evolve from human beings to pure joy and pure spirits, the all-pervading power wants us to realize the transformation. The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1. It is Free of Charge. Because It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>2. It is simple and easy.<\/p>\n<p>Do not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday. 3. Anyone can do it.<\/p>\n<p>Just need pure desire in your heart and it starts flowing. 4.

The point of this group is to cultivate real friendships and form a safe place where you can be yourself, vent if necessary, and have fun where everyone understands your social anxiety. Let\u2019s squash the stereotype that women and\/or black women can\u2019t be friends. Life is hectic and sometimes you need to get away and the tri-state area is full of fun and interesting people and things to do, so let come together. You will be required to attend at least one event within the first two months of joining or you will be removed from the group. I understand life gets hectic and plans sometimes must be canceled but the point is to show up for each other. With that being said there will be an opportunity to join the group again if a spot opens. In this group we\u2019ll hang out and just be cool. Explore the city and all its surroundings.

You can literally travel around the world in NY without even getting on a plane. Exploring different ethnic neighborhoods and sampling their delicious ethnic dishes is a must, whether you live in NYC or are just visiting. Eating in an ethnic restaurant is about more than just the food, it\u2019s a cultural experience that gives you a literal taste of life in another land. <\/p>\n<p><strong> OUR OBJECTIVES<\/strong>: This group is specifically meant for those who enjoy exploring the great diversity of ethnic cuisines from all around the world in a fun, relaxed atmosphere in the company of other like-minded adventurous foodies right here in the NYC and surrounding vicinities. Together we will eat our way through a cornucopia of exotic cuisines representing all corners of the globe. <\/p>\n<p><strong> OUR MEETUPS<\/strong>: Good food is meant to be shared. At each Meetup, we will dine <strong>FAMILY-STYLE, NO EXCEPTIONS<\/strong>! Attendees will have a say in the selection of a variety of dishes. Final food bill, together with tax and tips will be shared among the attendees. Any drinks are separate and are the responsibility of the drinkers. Number of attendees to our events will be kept at a small number (no more than 12) to allow everyone to get to know each other.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MEETUP FEE<\/strong>: To help defray the cost of paying Meetup HQ to keep the site up and running, a $1.00 Meetup fee will be collected at randomly selected events.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT GROUP RULES:<\/strong> A successful group is not about how many members there are in the group.

That's how we learn and grow as musicians.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for a drummer, a couple of guitarists who know how to play in an ensemble and not just wax into long solos, vocalists, keys, a good electric harp player. Brass and reeds that can fit into the format are also more than welcome. I am in Brooklyn, so musicians in NYC area with easy access to a venue in Manhattan or Brooklyn would be most appropriate. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I've been playing bass for many years (on and off with varying degrees of dedication) - some gigs, a lot of jamming and messing around, etc. etc. &nbsp;At the moment I own six basses, mostly short scale axes, although this count tends to vary. I love playing electric blues, funk, RnB and some light jazz, fusion jazz and acid rock. I am not a sight reader, but I do know my scales and chords well enough and my chops are respectable, including first position in many keys. I practice regularly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A number of venues where I used to jam have closed or changed their orientation. So I am dying to get together with some like minded musicians (you don't have to be a boomer) to put something together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Favorites include Muddy, Butterfield, Albert King, Wilson Pickett, Luther Allison, Fabulous TBirds, William Clarke, some Dylan and what Horace Silver I'm able to negotiate. I also have a decent number of original progressions that would be probably characterized as fusion or latin flavored blues, and of course anybody else's original material that fits our parameters is welcome. (I'm a big fan of Latin rhythms. Although I'm not well acquainted with the structure and harmonies of most Latin music, I'd love to learn about it. )<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Let's Wail!<\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p>MNG<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/7\/600_446945607.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/highres_446968787.jpeg","photo_id":446968787,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/600_446968787.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/7\/3\/thumb_446968787.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":190181111,"name":"Mikey Gold","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/highres_254005409.jpeg","photo_id":254005409,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/member_254005409.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/4\/1\/thumb_254005409.jpeg"}},"members":12,"name":"Roots n' Berries Music","id":19565093,"state":"NY","urlname":"Boomers-Blues-Summit","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"musicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455394646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"paddling","name":"Paddling","id":726},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"exhawaiians","name":"Hawaiian Culture","id":7071},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"the-aloha-spirit","name":"The Aloha Spirit","id":24334},{"urlkey":"canoe","name":"Canoeing","id":31885},{"urlkey":"east-coast","name":"East Coast","id":43608},{"urlkey":"outrigger-canoe-paddling","name":"Outrigger Canoe Paddling","id":57253},{"urlkey":"outrigger-paddling","name":"Outrigger paddling","id":1393132},{"urlkey":"outrigger","name":"Outrigger","id":1508692},{"urlkey":"vaa","name":"Va'a","id":1508693},{"urlkey":"east-coast-outrigger","name":"East Coast Outrigger","id":1508694}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/eastcoastoutrigger\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Waterwomen and Watermen -- I Mua!<\/p>\n<p>Does the open ocean call you?

How about joining a community of like-minded water enthusiasts who embrace the spirit of aloha?<\/p>\n<p><span>The East Coast Outrigger Racing Association (ECORA) was founded in 1997 to establish Polynesian outrigger canoe paddling and racing on the east coast of mainland U.S.A. and Canada. Today there are more than thirty outrigger canoe clubs all up and down the east coast. ECORA thrives in nearly every coastal state from Maine to Florida, Quebec and Ontario. We welcome interested paddlers to join an existing club or form a new one.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Outrigger canoe paddling builds on the culture and tradition that span centuries prior to the recorded history of Hawai'i and Polynesia. The indigenous sport survived the oppression of being outlawed by foreign settlers and pushed aside by waves of modernization. In Hawai'i, King David Kalakaua, a Hawaiian monarch, is credited for catalyzing Hawaiian cultural resurgence during the late 19th century. He restored outrigger canoe racing as a legal sport for the Hawaiian people. Around the world, outrigger canoe paddling and racing continues to grow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The international presence of outrigger canoes is marked by key stronghold races that draw the world's best competitors.

Want brutally honest Feedback?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>Pitch Practice Forum goal is to give startup founders as much feedback as they can get about their pitch and business idea. Each attendee will use a Web app to make a Hypothetical Investment decision in the startup and write feedback about the pitch. At the end of the pitch, each startup will be drilled with 15 mins of questions from the audience. Our goal here is to give the founders a fresh perspective and new set of eyes on their business.<\/p>\n<p> <br>Future Plan: People make vastly different investment decisions when actual money is at stake, even if the value in question is very small. We are considering charging the attendees a higher fee of which, half will be given back to them to invest in the startup that they just heard pitching (no equity involved). At the end of the pitch event, the money invested by the attendees will be given to the startup founders.&nbsp; <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>eg: If the we charge you $10 to attend the meetup we will give you back $5 which you can invest.

Don't you wish you can meet more people with the same taste of bands that you listen to? If you answered yes to both questions, then this meetup is for you!\n\nMy name is Wilfredo Betance Jr, and I've been going to metalcore shows throughout the past 9 years. I honestly want to meet more people that like my kind of music and that like to rock out at shows! The only time I'm around people that like my kind of music is when I go to shows, but everyone is usually with their group of friends and don't want to mingle! (weirdos lol). I thought to myself, \"if I'm having these thoughts, maybe there are others like me who feel the same way!\" The purpose of this group is create a fan-base group between us metalcore\/post-hardcore fans in the NJ\/NYC area to hang out and go to shows!\n\n------Questions you may have regarding the meetup group------\n\n1.What do you mean by metalcore\/post hardcore shows?\n\nI know people get the genres titles mixed up. To reduce any confusion, I'm going to list some of the bands I listen to so you guys have an idea of the type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\nA Day To Remember\nOur Last Night\nBullet for My Valentine\nSlipknot\nAsking Alexandra\nMemphis May Fire\nIssues\nI See Stars\nCrown the Empire\nBlack Veil Brides\nEscape The Fate\nSuicide Silence\nRise Against\nMotionless in White\nPalisades\nThe Amity Affliction\nSilvertien\nBlessthefall\nSleeping with sirens\nPierce the veil\nFalling in Reverse\nThe Word Alive\nBring Me The Horizon\nWe Came as Romans\nEmmure\nChunk! No, Captain Chuck!\n\nAlright, I can go on forever with this list! Lol. I hope this gives you guys an idea of type of shows this meetup is meant for.\n\n2. How will this meetup operate?\nI'm going to post a list of shows that I'll be attending, and I'm going to list restaurants around the show's venue where we can meet up and hang before the show!\n\nIf you guys have any shows that you are attending and what to have it announced in the group, go ahead and announce it!\n\n--------Some ground Rules-------\n\n1. This isn't an advertisement platform. This is a platform for us like-minded people, with similar taste of music, to get to know one another and attend shows together!\n\n2. Don't make fun at others for listening to a particular band. Keep your comments and opinions to yourself.\n\nThe only type of advertising that's allowed\n1.

If you have this burning desire to make your life more meaningful by contributing to the society, less fortunate people in some way but do not know where to start with, if you have an idea but need the support of like minded people to turn it into reality, if you want to open an Non profit organization (NGO) but need more help and expertise, if you believe in achieving personal greatness and living your life to the full potential \u2013 please join this group. Together, we can share ideas, learn new ways of thinking, motivate each other, work towards making our life more purposeful by contributing to mankind.","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":42559942,"name":"Pooja","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/c\/1\/highres_253938369.jpeg","photo_id":253938369,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/c\/1\/member_253938369.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/c\/1\/thumb_253938369.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"\"I Believe In Religion Of Humanity\" Meetup","id":19581073,"state":"NJ","urlname":"I-Believe-In-Religion-Of-Humanity-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Believers in Humanity"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455671459000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"progmuslim","name":"Progressive Muslim","id":6866},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"muslim-professionals","name":"Muslim Professionals","id":17450},{"urlkey":"muslim-moms","name":"Muslim Moms","id":17669},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"muslim","name":"Muslim","id":43307},{"urlkey":"muslim-sisters","name":"Muslim Sisters","id":44480},{"urlkey":"converts-to-islam","name":"Converts to Islam","id":46820},{"urlkey":"american-muslims","name":"American Muslims","id":46821},{"urlkey":"muslim-women","name":"Muslim Women","id":47297},{"urlkey":"new-muslim-converts","name":"New Muslim Converts","id":47628},{"urlkey":"women-in-islam","name":"Women in Islam","id":48791}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Professional-Muslim-Women-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Late 20s to late 40s professional muslim women who would like to enjoy the camaraderie and friendship of their Sisters.

Good company. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;A grown-er grown &amp; sexy vibe.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 patronizing black business <br><\/p>\n<p> Are you still curious?? Just come thru. <\/p>\n<p>Why Nhappi Hour?? <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To have the hard conversations in an easier way <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To curate community, one conversation at a time <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To create a different space to meet men\/women <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To speak, listen, and share our voices and perspectives <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To party together, in a different way <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022Still curious?? R.S.V.P, and just come thru. <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br>The extended rundown: <br><\/p>\n<p>Our \"cocktails &amp; conversations\" type of event is a social collective of (mostly Black) men and women who meet up once per month, patronize a Black-owned lounge or venue (commit to spending at least $20), and have a curated conversation and exploration on a topic related to Black Love &amp; Black sociocultural issues. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour was created by 2 professional facilitators, who work consistently at the art of making conversation happen in our professional lives, and we just wanted to take it further. We decided to create a space for conversation about the state of BLACK LOVE and Black issues...but in a fun, interactive way. We are diligent about keeping the dialogue, energy and space, safe and sacred. We figured, \"Hey, if we can cultivate conversations among teens, inmates, and other populations successfully, why not bridge the gap in communication in our immediate community, starting with Black men and women?\" <br><\/p>\n<p>So yeah, <br>Nhappi Hour is an interactive experience. <br>What does that mean? <br>It means, we don't JUST sit around and talk. We all participate in activities, games, and crafts that help keep the conversation going. So if you're looking to just be a voyeur... nahhh potna'. Interactive means, YOUR voice, YOUR participation, YOUR love, matters. So, lean IN to the experience. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour is FILLED with drama. Literally. <br>We use short, entertaining skits\/scenes\/poetry\/whateva...&nbsp; performed by our facilitators to introduce the conversation, and to push to the dialogue forward. <br> <br>Nhappi Hour is perfect for singles as a cool way to meet men and women in a low pressure, cool, interactive environment. <br>But, Nhappi Hour is beneficial for dating couples and married couples as well. Your perspective in a community dialogue is a great influence on bridging the gap in communication between men and women. <br>Nhappi hour is open to all adults, but our target demographic is mid-20-40's. <br>Our conversations center around Black Heterosexual relationships, but because we do discuss broader community\/cultural issues as well, we understand that Black people of all sexual orientations can add value and perspective to the dialogue, as can folk of other races\/cultures...and so, all are welcome. <br>We just wanna be transparent- our event will be focused on the Black heterosexual agenda so don't get it twisted. <br>We're clear, you should be, too. <br> But yeah, <br>Join the discussion. <br><\/p>\n<p>NABE Harlem Downstairs (127th Street and Fred. Douglass Blvd) is our private meeting spot for the night of exciting activities and dialogue. Come thru and help us support this Black-owned business, by committing to spend at least $20. They have a full menu and full bar as well, so that should be easy (and you can always buy someone else a drink if youuuu don't drink...wink) <br> <br>RSVP today.

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo. Thank You for your time and we hope to see you at our meet ups!<\/p> \n<p>Thank You for your time and we look forward to getting to know each and every one of you and hopefully have an opportunity to

In each meeting we fire up a discussion to explore your truest self in a safe, encouraging atmosphere and offer a self-reflective exercise for harnessing inner wisdom. If you\u2019re ready to hear and be heard by an awesome group of women, recharge your battery pack, and break all glass ceilings, then this is your time to RADIATE. \n\nNapoleon Hill outlined the mastermind principle beautifully in his book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d. He speaks of the group as a collection of energy--each one of us carries our own battery pack, but together, we increase our voltage and can bring more light into our lives and the world (through connecting with each other in an authentic way)!\n\nMany groups exist for networking purposes, particularly when it involves business, but Radiate Mastermind is not just about your business--it\u2019s about the business of living. We are, each of us, seeking our own path and doing the best we can to \u201cstay true\u201d to the path.

As school professionals we are limited in WHEN we can travel (summers, winter break, spring break, Christmas break), but have ample travel time. We also know that prices during the times that we travel are at their highest. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to travel opportunities, we will also host Meet Up events to brainstorm travel ideas, attend travel shows and explore international cuisine and cultures in and around NYC. Additional costs may be required to reserve a spot for these events.<\/p>\n<p><b>Membership:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>To join, answer a few simple questions. Once your membership is approved, you will receive a notification with a link to pay the non-refundable $23.98 annual membership dues.

To be considered for membership, three questions must be answered in detail (i.e., name the specific countries or cities that you have traveled to).<\/p>\n<p>3. The Meet Up cannot be used to sell your product\/service directly to members, or used to solicit members via Meet Up messaging. If a member reports being solicited, you will be immediately removed from the group.<\/p>\n<p>4.

Do you enjoy playing DOTA 2 and would love to play with a regular group of people?

Then this&nbsp;free group for adult gamers (18+) is perfect for you! <\/strong>Imagine playing DOTA 2 with kind and&nbsp;supportive adult&nbsp;teammates!...

Activities would include weekend dinners \/ drinks , evening art shows, wine tasting, live music, movies, comedy clubs and brunches. We can use Groupon's amazing offers to occasionally throw in mani\/pedis, spas , exercise\/dance classes. Other suggestions are always welcome! Our activities will change depending on the season. We can incorporate more outdoor activities during the spring and summer! I plan to start with one meetup every month and increase it to two per month depending on the response I get.

This is a meetup for those who feel that they have real singing talent and want the feedback of caring people who want to help one another. This meetup is going to be set up for a limited size group (5 people max per Meetup- want each person to really have a chance to sing and get feedback) that must be willing to commit to showing up and paying for their seat in a private karaoke room in midtown manhattan. If you do not want to pay for your spot or are just looking for a group to socialize with, there are other karaoke meetups that are much better suited for you, please check those out instead. This meetup will be dedicated to practicing, and will be a lot of fun for those who put effort into it. Please only request to join if you really want to practice singing and get feedback from your peers. This meetup is meant to be a nurturing, comfortable place for those who want to test their vocal range through their song choices, so no photos or videos will be allowed during the meetup. As mentioned, this meetup will occur in a private karaoke room; access to the room is charged per person, per hour. I will get specifics on how much each attendee will have to pay on the RSVP. The Meetup will be limited to 5 people in total (no guests allowed), so once the RSVP is open, it is first come, first served. All cancellations to an RSVP must occur 24 hours BEFORE the event because we are committing to bringing a certain number of people to in order to reserve the room. I need to be sure that everyone who RSVPs will show up to ensure we do not lose the room to a larger group (or worse, have to collectively pay for the empty seat) because we are suddenly short on people for the reservation.

All nationalities are welcome.\n\nWhat can you expect? Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 30-40 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.

Baby Sign Language lets babies, as young as six months old communicate their needs so they don't need to cry as often. Your baby will learn how to tell you when she is hungry, wants more, or is all done; if he is too cold or too hot, or if she just needs a hug. Studies reveal that babies who sign begin speaking earlier and have a larger vocabulary than their non-signing peers. I started this group because I wanted to empower my baby girl to express herself through signing and because I could find no classes in our local area. Packing baby up to take her into the City or into Bergen County was not something that I wanted to do on a regular basis. Instead, I've created a network of instructors who will travel to us to provide classes. Classes are fun and interactive as babies and their parents learn signing through song and music. We will meet at local (Hudson County) libraries and community centers.<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/highres_447266739.jpeg","photo_id":447266739,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/600_447266739.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/7\/3\/thumb_447266739.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200531712,"name":"Deborah Hines","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/highres_254274848.jpeg","photo_id":254274848,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/member_254274848.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/4\/0\/thumb_254274848.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Hudson County Baby Signers","id":19633124,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Hudson-County-Baby-Signers","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Parents of Baby Signers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Beach","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456592362000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"environment","name":"Environment","id":89},{"urlkey":"alternativeenergy","name":"Alternative Energy","id":1980},{"urlkey":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","id":15998},{"urlkey":"environmental-activism","name":"Environmental Activism","id":18721},{"urlkey":"environmental-awareness","name":"Environmental Awareness","id":23842},{"urlkey":"save-widlife","name":"Save Widlife","id":450102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Surfrider-Central-LI-Chapter\/","rating":0,"description":"The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to the the protection and enjoyment of oceans, waves and beaches through a powerful activist network.

Our goal is to provide a space for professional women from a diverse range of disciplines can relax unwind and network with peers in a collaborative and rewarding environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>While the group is mainly geared towards women, we aren't in this alone; men make up the other half of the equation and as such, men who support women's empowerment are critical allies and are welcome to bring a fresh perspective from a male p.o.v. to the group. A sample of the important areas of focus for the group include the following: <br><\/p>\n<p>Business Ideas and Strategies to Maximize Success. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you've got it all figured out and want to share, or are struggling along, this group formulates ideas and strategies to move you to the next level your career. <br><\/p>\n<p>Interpersonal Relationships and Communication <br><\/p>\n<p>Balancing work and relationships is a challenge every successful business woman must master. Here women share their experiences and strategies for having a rewarding personal life outside of the boardroom. <br><\/p>\n<p>Women's Leadership and Political Representation <br><\/p>\n<p>Representation in the business and political worlds is key to the successful integration of women into the decision-making fabric of our society. Business women explore the means for effective representation in an ever changing world. <br><\/p>\n<p>Children and Career <br><\/p>\n<p>So, we've met all the deadlines, closed the latest deal, or negotiated a jaw-dropping settlement in a lawsuit. What now? This group effectively explores and provides solutions to effectively manage our maternal instincts, with work life. <br><\/p>\n<p>Overcoming Fear of Failure <br><\/p>\n<p>\"Courage allows the successful woman to fail and learn powerful lessons, from the failure. So that in the end, she didn't fail at all.\" -Maya Angelou<\/p>\n<p> Studies show [1], a major inhibitor of success among women, much more so than men, is fear of failure. But why fear failure, when you can mine it for gems that will help you to become even more successful than you would have been without this bump in the road? This group examines the rules of engagement when facing failures. We discuss these teaching moments as phenomenal launching pads to coming back stronger and more successful than ever. <br><\/p>\n<p>Beyond our member-driven seminars and workshops, we also take time to bond and enjoy the wider world. Whether dressing up and having a night on the town or planning an adventurous excursion, anything can happen when women put their minds to it. Come join us and make friendships which will last a lifetime. <br><\/p>\n<p>[1] Clifford, Catherine. \"Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.\" Lack of Confidence, Fear of Failure Hold Women Back From Being Entrepreneurs.

Not only is it an important source of carbohydrates, it\u2019s also portable and compact, which helps to explain why it has been an integral part of our diet for thousands of years. In fact, recent scholarship suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 years ago. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Nutritional significance<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nutritionally, bread is known as an ample source for the grains category of nutrition. Serving size of bread is standard through ounces, counting one slice of bread (white processed bread) as 1 oz. Also, bread is considered a good source of carbohydrates through the whole grains, nutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber. As part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,&nbsp;it is recommended to make at least half of the recommended total grain intake as whole grains and to overall increase whole grains intake.<\/p>\n<p><b>Serving and consumption<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Bread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can subsequently be toasted. It is most commonly eaten with the hands, either by itself or as a carrier for other foods. Bread can be dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive oil, or soup; it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads, or used to make sandwiches containing myriad varieties of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.<\/p>\n<p>Bread may also be used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as the use of breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces, sweet or savory bread puddings, or as a binding agent in sausages and other ground meat products.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/8\/e\/highres_448986798.jpeg","photo_id":448986798,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/8\/e\/600_448986798.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/8\/e\/thumb_448986798.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":58925432,"name":"Valerie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/9\/a\/highres_252391898.jpeg","photo_id":252391898,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/9\/a\/member_252391898.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/c\/9\/a\/thumb_252391898.jpeg"}},"members":95,"name":"NY Bread Lover Sociey","id":19646006,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Bread-Lover-Society","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"breadies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456837957000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"black-entrepreneurs","name":"Black Entrepreneurs","id":16348},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"draw","name":"Drawing","id":20805},{"urlkey":"black-culture","name":"Black Culture","id":20894},{"urlkey":"exhibitions","name":"Exhibitions","id":22940},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"black-business","name":"Black Business","id":24825},{"urlkey":"african-american-business-owners","name":"African American Business Owners","id":27748},{"urlkey":"african-american","name":"African Americans","id":35203},{"urlkey":"african-american-business-professionals","name":"African American Business Professionals","id":115694},{"urlkey":"black-business-network","name":"Black Business Network","id":130576},{"urlkey":"young-black-professionals","name":"young black professionals","id":130665}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AnkhLave-Mind-Media\/","rating":0,"description":"AnkhLave is a Curatorial Brand for Artists of and for African Diaspora.

It was part of a publication known then (and to this day) as \"Mix To Go Magazine.\" \"Massive\" was created to promote the coming together of New Yorkers for parties, social events, travel-oriented events related to music (like a ski weekend, Caribbean cruise or music festival) and the like. The group grew quickly from just a NYC chapter to chapters in Miami, Vegas and Atlanta...then just as quickly its founder \"got busy living\" and shut down the meetups. But \"Mix To Go Massive\" kept going and growing; it is still a very active Facebook group of over 5,000 members (www.facebook.com\/groups\/mixtogo). The return of \"Mix To Go Massive\" to Meetup is to create a NEW atmosphere of fun and excitement for people who like to go out and dance, socialize and hear good music. Most genres are represented musically but the four most requested are top 40\/open format (a little of everything popular in a great DJ mix), EDM Parties (think Pacha and Webster Hall...MINUS those venues; no disrespect if you like them!!), house music (there are a few splits genre-wise...especially during the summer when endless outdoor parties take place)...and Caribbean events (especially if you hang out in Brooklyn). \"Mix To Go Massive\" founder Freedom hosts seven (7) events weekly with additional \"one-offs\" such as yacht parties, 1 day cruises and holiday events...and in 2017 there will be a seasonal travel-oriented event. Join the movement IF you plan to be an active member (this is one of the reasons the groups were disbanded before). Bring friends, make suggestions and attend our weekly \"town hall meetings\" where we discuss the \"business of having fun\" in New York City: Suggestions are made by members, ideas are presented to the group and \"secret\" events and VIP-only events are announced to the most active members. In addition to the Facebook page and now this meetup site you can follow the daily posts on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr @djfreedomlives as well as @djfreedomglobal (over 7,000 followers there). See you in the (social) mix!

At the risk of sounding morbid, when it\u2019s my time to go I want to be sliding into home base with dirt flying all over the place!

When the yogi and dancer in us meet the interplay of their energies gives birth to a theater fueled not by their search for stardom, but by their quest for the betterment of humanity. The ultimate purpose of this yoga class is to prepare practitioners to develop a discipline and daily yoga practice in order to exercise introspection, build self-awareness and ultimately achieve growth. \"Knowing love, I will allow all things to come and go, to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage. Life is right in any case. My heart is as open as the sky.\" About Sylvie Bayeux Being a multifaceted woman Sylvie sees her self foremost as an Educator. She has been a religious yoga practitioner throughout her entire artistic career in theater and dance, developing her own personal practice based on Iyenger, Ashtanga and Multiversal schools of yoga. Teaching yoga to dancers, athletes and neophytes she helps them achieve strength, flexibility, and balance. Yet most importantly she guides them through a life-transforming experience, that of freeing their power within. Sylvie walks the path of yoga daily, as woman, dancer and artist, sharing her yoga knowledge through what she considers to be her dearest art form, the Art of Teaching.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":200863933,"name":"Sylvie Bayeux","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/highres_254443135.jpeg","photo_id":254443135,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/member_254443135.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/7\/f\/thumb_254443135.jpeg"}},"members":53,"name":"Midtown East Yoga & Dance","id":19659610,"state":"NY","urlname":"Midtown-East-Yoga-Dance","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Yoga Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457108011000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"modern-architecture-and-design","name":"Modern Architecture and Design","id":38050},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"residential-real-estate-development","name":"Residential Real Estate Development","id":95710},{"urlkey":"architects-and-interior-designers","name":"architects and interior designers","id":699492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCArchitects-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all architects!

And this is not simply for those struggling with substance abuse problems but I promise you are not alone.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>That's why I created: <br>The giant leap! for the other 83%: <br>Did u know that AA and NA programs only help 17% of addicts for whom alcohol is not their main drug of choice? I tried it and frankly it seemed like the more I tried to serve their god the more it felt like I was the butt of the big guy's joke. That is why I have made this giant leap for the other 83% of mankind who were made to feel somehow defective because of AA <br>1 acknowledge that u r not powerless I mean u dragged ur ass to this meeting right? U r trying to take control of ur life so commend urself for that <br>2 write down every craving u have and I guarantee u will find them to be fewer and further between. Also write down everything u have tried in the past to get sober and everything u will do differently. Notice how much prouder u already feel&nbsp; <br>3 if step two is hard because the last thing u wanna do when u have a craving is sit and stew in it, reach out for help. Real friends will be happy to help <br>4 try and remember a time when u knew urself and imagine urself at that age and what pure joys made u happy. Whatever it may be I guarantee u will involuntarily smile <br>5 through the reflection and meditation of step four u should be capable of finding the strength and power within urself: the strength that brought ur ass to this meeting and will hopefully prepare u for the next step <br>6 it is true that u will have to make amends to someone I mean lets be real but u may not always get the response u want so for every apology u make remind urself of something good u have done too even if that good thing is simply getting sober! <br>7 this one is a little tricky granted but will definitely help: think back to when u were a child and try to remember anything u were obsessed with whether it was a boy girl food or the idea of being popular. If u realize that the disease effected u before u encountered the drug then the next step will not be easy <br>8 by this point things in ur life that were once easy have now become incredibly hard, if they weren't then u would not be an addict. So while the main person u should be doing this for is u there are I'm sure other people in ur life or whom u would like back in ur life that u wish to be stronger for. Just think about them <br>9 confront those people and tell them U want to help them but u may need their help too. If u don't get the response u want remember step6 but the positive feedback is certain to keep u going at least for a while <br>10 by now the pressure of everyone accepting u again is building and you want to trip over ur own foot so u have no one else to blame. At this point return to steps 1,3&amp;4 even simultaneously. Remember that power inside urself? It may feel dim but it cannot be snuffed out. After all ur still alive right?&nbsp; <br>I'll admit I cannot promise that this alone will make me happy but I can tell u it gave me the hope of a happy future. My name is Ellie.

Do you do booty calls? Do you have a friend with benefits situation you are considering? Well, let me tell you about this awesome group!<\/p>\n<p>This group is for singles (especially women) who have woken up from the Disney fantasy you have been sold and are looking for more logical, sensible and fun relationships. Marriage is great and all but finding a life partner is no small task and you are NOT getting any younger. Maybe you have given up or maybe you still looking but in the meantime, you have a desire for some kind of physical intimacy. You can find somebody in this group or use this group as a support network to help you find somebody. Let's also share ideas and talk about ways to make non-traditional relationships work. How do you avoid getting hurt? How can you be safe? What about dealing with societal issues like women being shamed for having casual relationship? Is there a wrong way and right way to make it work? Let's meet up and do something fun as we talk about things in a safe environment where you don't have to worry about being judged. <br> <br>Although all daters are welcome, this group is more for confident daters who probably could do well with traditional dating if they so chose, but that is not their goal. The daters in this group should ideally not have problems attracting \"good people\" to date, it's just it's more about not finding what THEY want. Like with myself, if I just wanted a traditional girlfriend, I'd have no problem. The problem comes only with finding a woman who I actually want that with. The non-traditional dating options come in with what I do in the meanwhile until I find what I want for the long term.<\/p>\n<p>So ultimately this group is not really about attracting a partner but rather figuring out how to make non-traditional dating options work. It's about once you already find the partner you seek, how does it all work? We are open to discussing all kinds of options from non-sexual type relationships, OGBC, FWB, XWSEX,&nbsp; Cougar or whatever works for YOU, with the one exception of cheating. If that is your thing, that is on you, but this group cannot support you with that.<\/p>","lon":-74.0800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/highres_447741966.jpeg","photo_id":447741966,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/600_447741966.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/5\/c\/e\/thumb_447741966.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":201053631,"name":"Carl","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/highres_254538105.jpeg","photo_id":254538105,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/member_254538105.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/b\/9\/thumb_254538105.jpeg"}},"members":45,"name":"Hasbrouck Heights to hell with tradional Dating Meetup","id":19673746,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Hasbrouck-Heights-to-hell-with-tradional-Dating-Meetup","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Dating Rebels"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Forest Hills","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457345866000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pingpong","name":"Ping Pong","id":3262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Ping-Pong-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Want to play some recreational ping pong, join us at a club here in Forest Hills!

Recently, with improvements in hi-tech tools in cognitive neuroscience, such as EEG and fMRI devices, we can see brain activity better and more clearly than ever before. In addition, with affordable technologies such as tablets, smartphones, Google Glass, etc., we can design more individualized learning media.\n\nDetermining how each student learns based on cognitive neuroscience and designing digital media for learning based on educational theories will lead to success in more students\u2019 learning. Current teaching methods are only targeting a specific group of students; however, we need more individualized learning. We are losing many talents along the way due to our poor understanding of how people learn and our inability to adjust instruction to meet each student\u2019s particular need. \n\nThis group aims to contribute to the study of mind, brain, technology and education to identify individual differences among students, create learning design principles for designing more individualized digital learning media and techniques to improve students\u2019 learning capacity. We believe the social environment affects learning as much as genetics, and we believe each student has their limitations and strengths. It is our mission to encourage students to take advantage of their strengths and to work with them to improve their limitations. \n\nThis group welcomes Cognitive Neuroscientists, Technologists, Educators and any person who is interested in using cognitive neuroscience to improve digital media design for

The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative is a series of individual learning events focused on leadership topics that are relevant to both work and personal life. Each leadership development event features a guest speaker with a deep level of expertise on a relevant topic, along with facilitated dialogue and exercises that help participants to apply knowledge to life and work. OPERATING PRINCIPLES 1. We seek to Democratize Leadership Development We believe great development opportunities should be available to anyone, anywhere. The cost however, in both time and money, can be prohibitive for many people to participate. This is especially true for individuals on a limited budget, small business owners, individual realtors and consultants, government officials, and those engaged in non-profit organizations. For people in for-profit business organizations, our offerings will complement your in- house training at a very competitive fee. To help democratize leadership development, our fees will always be reasonable, and based on the presenter's fee and costs for each event. Plus, we will allow you to self- select lower fees, if needed. We even offer a fee where you can choose to attend in exchange for performing a good deed. It will be that easy to afford! 2. Knowledge is an expense, while Applied Knowledge is development and an investment. As an example, take the simple transaction of purchasing a self-help or business book, ideally at your local bookstore. You finish reading the book, but you do not find any content meaningful to you and, as a result, you do not apply any of the content. We would suggest the purchase of this book is an expense. In another instance, you purchase and complete a different self-help or business book, you find the content relevant and, as a result, apply the content and it improves an aspect of your life\/work. This purchase can be characterized as an investment, as you received a return on your investment of the cost of this book. follow up with coaching or peer group meetings. 3. We will always do our Good Deed! In the spirit of creating meaningful change in the world, The Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative will donate the net proceeds of each learning event to designated organizations that have a clear purpose of positively contributing to their community.","lon":-74.2699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201100640,"name":"John Harvey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/highres_254563924.jpeg","photo_id":254563924,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/member_254563924.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/9\/4\/thumb_254563924.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"Maplewood Leadership Development Initiative","id":19677729,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Maplewood-Leadership-Development-Initiative","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Particpants"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edgewater","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457405339000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"sound-therapy-healing","name":"Sound Therapy & Healing","id":25952},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"gong-sound-bath-meditation","name":"GONG SOUND BATH MEDITATION","id":293601},{"urlkey":"healing-with-sacred-sounds","name":"HEALING WITH SACRED SOUNDS","id":293651},{"urlkey":"gongs-tibetan-singing-bowls-crystal-bowls","name":"Gongs.

All you have to do is lay down comfortably and receive the sound energy of the vibrational sound tools being played, which move through the nervous system and chakras - opening, clearing and recharging the whole mind, body and spirit, which triggers a meditation state in which you have the opportunity to relinquish control of the mind. Negativity and stress are suspended, resistance is cleared, and the whole being is reset to a state of synchrony and alignment. You can expect to become very relaxed, and maybe even fall asleep!

In this powerful and comprehensive professional two-day training, you will receive everything you need to become a confident and successful Shamanic Reiki I practioner. You will learn to harness this powerful healing energy and channel it to yourself and others. Becoming a Reiki practioner opens energy channels in the body and the spirit. This can lead to deep and profound changes in your quality of life, sense of self, and your ability to manifest. Not to mention giving yourself a holistic way to work with your own physical challenges. Even after a Reiki I training, students often experience a heightened sense of intuition and even psychic sense. Life direction can become clearer, as well as a heightened ability to hold love in a deeper way. Reiki teaches us to align with our innate compassion and goodness, and opens us to new possibilities. Finally, in Reiki, the \u2018healer is made\u2019. We are all healers, and Reiki is said to lie dormant in our DNA, waiting for us to excavate it and use it for the benefit of others and the world. The following will be covered in this SHAMANIC REIKI I class: - Historical background of Traditional Usui Reiki - In depth definition of what Reiki is and what it can do - Shamanic journeying for healing - The hand positions to treat self and others - Working with plants and stones - Energetic extraction and Soul Healing - The Reiki I Attunement Ceremony - The alchemy of healing - Reiki ethics - Using Reiki to cure specific conditions (physical and emotional) - Using Reiki to empower your goals - The energy body (the Aura)and the Chakras - You will learn to do administer a full Reiki treatment - A detailed reiki manual - A certificate of completion - Lots of love and personal attention REIKI, as defined by the International Center for Reiki Training Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by the \u201claying on of hands\u201d and is based on the idea that an unseen \u201clife force energy\u201d flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means \u201cGod\u2019s Wisdom or the Higher Power\u201d and Ki which is \u201clife force energy.\u201d So Reiki is actually \u201cspiritually guided life force energy.\u201d In a Reiki class, one receives a Reiki \u2018attunement\u2019 \u2014 the Reiki Master facilitates a transference of universal life force energy to the student. The student is then able to work with Reiki energy at will.

We are excited to announce that we have scheduled our <b>Kick-Off Meeting for April 11th from 10am-12pm;<\/b> you may already RSVP if you are planning on attending. We will then have our <b>first 2-3 mile walk as a group at Little Bay Park on April 18th at 10am<\/b>. Our spring schedule is complete and we will be adding meet ups to our group calendar shortly.<\/p>\n<p>Now for a little background on your <b>group organizers, Larissa and Debra.<\/b> We are Personal Wellness Coaches as well as Independent Product Distributors for Herbalife. Our goal, up until now, was to simply reach as many people as we could (between our full time Mommy positions) and assist our clients on their personal journeys; health, fitness and nutrition were the focal points of our coaching. While this is still something we love to do, we have learned a few things along the way of our own journeys.<\/p>\n<p><b>Social\/Group Walking<\/b> has been proven to work on many levels. The one that stood out most for us was the community aspect. The fields of fitness and nutrition need a community of like minded people to be there to support one another. When you set out to make a lifestyle change, you need a cheering section and someone to help you up when you stumble. Change can be scary, so having others to offer their experiences, knowledge and accomplishments is a great way to keep your confidence and momentum going. While some are able to achieve success without a community standing behind them, difficulties may emerge, weight will be put back on, meal planning and prepping will no longer be enjoyable, and suddenly, many find themselves right back where they started.<\/p>\n<p><b>We are hoping for a large variety of excited participants from different backgrounds, decades, generations and cultures.<\/b> The individuals that we believe will benefit most from our vision are simply those who believe in the benefits of exercising with a group. <b>Walking, in particular, is a low impact form of exercise that mostly everyone can do on a regular basis. <\/b>We are not looking to conduct high intensity classes, or incorporate weights and other fitness apparatus that would make it difficult to focus on our main objectives of fitness and socialization. Members, you are invited to bring your children, strollers, and babies. Pet parents, your dogs are also welcomed. We see each and every one of you as a valuable member of our growing community and we will not place restrictions on members when at all possible.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to us that our members understand that we are a social walking group and our visions and goals are geared towards creating a community based on the common interest of leading healthier, more active lifestyles. While we may incorporate Herbalife into some of our Meet ups, <b>our main objective is to create our community of Whitestone Walking Warriors<\/b> <b>and make it something we can all be proud of. Members will never be required to take part in Herbalife in order to continue with our Meet ups. <\/b>Herbalife taught us one of the most valuable lessons in the health and fitness field: a community is essential. A strong, active, committed community knows no bounds when it comes to supporting one another on their personal wellness journeys.<\/p>\n<p>We are really looking forward to putting our plan into action!

She\u2019s not so easily shocked and can take a joke and loves to laugh.&nbsp; A Great Dame may not be as confident as she looks but she\u2019ll fake it whenever necessary.<\/p>\n<p><span>Great Dames is a group of women over 50 who are not cowed by their age, in fact, they FLAUNT it! They enjoy the company of other women, they love to laugh so hard they pee and are willing to take a big bite out of life. They are IN or READY FOR their second or third act. This all came about because of a play I wrote, produce and act in called Dames Like Us!&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>It's an ensemble monologue play that goes straight for the funny in its mission to politely demolish long-held stereotypes of women \"of a certain age\". The seven fabulous New York actresses who are part of my rotating cast are amazingly talented, a lot of fun and they like sharing their gifts.<\/p>\n<p>And so, coming soon, we'll all be putting our heads together to come up with fun stuff to do in the city with you as well as series of workshops that will stimulate your creativity and imagination.<\/p>\n<p>Being a Great Dame isn't just a Meetup Group - it's a REVOLUTION!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/e\/8\/600_448165064.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome, Francesca<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/e\/e\/highres_449435822.jpeg","photo_id":449435822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/e\/e\/600_449435822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/e\/e\/thumb_449435822.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7334647,"name":"Francesca Rizzo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/5\/c\/highres_254720316.jpeg","photo_id":254720316,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/5\/c\/member_254720316.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/f\/5\/c\/thumb_254720316.jpeg"}},"members":65,"name":"Great Dames","id":19701575,"state":"NY","urlname":"great-dames","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Dames \/ Dame Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457882963000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"art","name":"Art","id":1502},{"urlkey":"cajun","name":"Cajun","id":7496},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"fiddle","name":"Fiddle","id":22363},{"urlkey":"guitar","name":"Guitar","id":22364},{"urlkey":"new-orleans","name":"new orleans","id":29901},{"urlkey":"acoustic-jams","name":"Acoustic Jams","id":40464},{"urlkey":"louisiana","name":"Louisiana","id":45173},{"urlkey":"jam-sessions","name":"Jam Sessions","id":48840},{"urlkey":"zydeco-goers","name":"Zydeco Goers","id":51430},{"urlkey":"music-jamming","name":"Music Jamming","id":72967},{"urlkey":"traditional-cajun-music","name":"Traditional Cajun Music","id":91176},{"urlkey":"cajun-dancing","name":"Cajun Dancing","id":1181742},{"urlkey":"creole-music","name":"creole music","id":1210942}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cajun-Community-Jam-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Bring your fiddle, accordion, banjo, mandolin, guitar, bass, or triangle ('tit fer).

Only when our emotions support our resulting thoughts, can thoughts be transformed into action. Otherwise, it's an uphill battle, with us trying to force ourselves into thinking or being a certain way. Positive thinking might just not be enough!<\/p>\n<p><span>You will learn about the power of observation vs. being a part of the negativity of your mind.

As interest grows for certain itineraries, there is a potential for groups to become larger. Because we truly want to be all-encompassing, there will be a mix of itineraries with destinations both domestic and international, various accommodation levels and price point, active and leisure itineraries, etc. Also, some trips will be joining larger groups and some will be private tours just for us. &nbsp;Although our main objective is to create itineraries for a mixed group of member, there will be occasional trips that will have a specific demographic focus (i.e. men or women only).<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for upcoming meetups where we can discuss current trips and ideas for the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Look forward to hearing from you and hope you join us one one of our up coming trips!....LET'S SEE THE WORLD TOGETHER!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please contact us with any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Best regards,<\/p>\n<p>Aurelio<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/highres_447935450.jpeg","photo_id":447935450,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/600_447935450.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/7\/a\/thumb_447935450.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185213487,"name":"Aurelio","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/highres_251806829.jpeg","photo_id":251806829,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/member_251806829.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/e\/d\/thumb_251806829.jpeg"}},"members":66,"name":"Rainbow Travelers Network","id":19718659,"state":"NY","urlname":"Rainbow-Travelers-Network","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Rainbow Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Maywood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458164792000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beekeeping","name":"Beekeeping","id":1993},{"urlkey":"honey","name":"Honey","id":58132},{"urlkey":"bees","name":"Bees","id":64759},{"urlkey":"urban-beekeeping","name":"Urban Beekeeping","id":75094},{"urlkey":"community-beekeeping","name":"Community Beekeeping","id":75095},{"urlkey":"keeping-your-honey-bees-healthy","name":"Keeping your Honey Bees Healthy","id":83603},{"urlkey":"meeting-local-beekeepers","name":"Meeting Local Beekeepers","id":83604},{"urlkey":"bee-keeping","name":"Bee keeping","id":148173},{"urlkey":"honeybees","name":"honeybees","id":304401},{"urlkey":"beekeeping-basics","name":"Beekeeping Basics","id":625042}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maywood-Meetup-for-local-beekeepers-meet-n-2-work-together\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Looking for local beekeepers who want to work together on keeping our hives healthy.

How you define yourself often limits you to playing a role, rather than developing an expanding sense of purpose. The truth is, these are simply our roles in society, not who we truly are. What happens when we attach ourselves to these roles too much? Attachment to our roles leads to overwhelming expectations, self-judgment, negative thoughts and beliefs. We can have expectations of attaining the perfect version of whatever role we are in, have fears of vulnerability, and judge ourselves harshly. We can become plagued with self-doubt: Am I smart enough? Am I good enough? Our thoughts and beliefs lead to our perceptions about the world and ourselves. It is as if we have blinders on which we seem to have no choice and a limited view on everything. Because of this, we are disconnected from others and ourselves. Success and happiness seem unreachable. How can we live a life where we honor who we really are, make conscious choices unaffected by misconceptions, and create the success and happiness we want? Mission: Transcend Group Coaching is a network of individuals that are on the journey to understand themselves better and create deep connection to others by supporting each other in living passionate and authentic lives. Through releasing these attachments to our roles, we can live more authentically, honoring who we truly are, and enjoying every moment. Together this group will support each other in reducing unrealistic societal, familial, and personal expectations. We will break through barriers we have created with in ourselves for years and live more in the present moment. We will reduce fear and judgment while increasing happiness, success, and connection. Imagine this new you at a crowded party, talking to someone you are attracted to; at a work event; or an awkward family gathering, having the confidence to connect with people in new ways, having meaningful conversation, and engaging with others like never before. In this group you will release self-doubt, fear, loneliness, and insecurities, and replace it with confidence, courage, and a support network to live a connected, conscious, and aware life. In my coaching practice, I have been recognized for my ability to ask thought-provoking questions to help individuals and groups dig deeper into exploring who they are and what is important to them. With monthly conference phone calls, an online community forum, weekly discussion questions, and individually defined actions steps, I will help create an environment of support, motivation, and inspiration. We will break down physical, mental, and spiritual barriers that have gotten in the way of connecting with others and ourselves. The fact is that everyone has challenges, limiting beliefs, assumptions and judgments about themselves and the world. Together we will embrace our challenges, understand our desires, and live our purpose\u2026 Get ready to Transcend! The Benefits of Conference Calls for Group Coaching As we connect with people around us we are drawn to similarities. We are attracted to people that look like us, have similar clothing or other outward traits. These superficial characteristics can either create connection with people or stop us from getting to know them. It is common to put more weight on these superficial characteristics of people but the reality is that it can keep us from getting to know them in deeper ways. Through group phone conversation, we will transcend physical superficial barriers and focus instead on the energy, values, and beliefs of each person. It will help create a new way of being. With this new awareness, we will honor what makes us all unique, truly learning from each other and growing together.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201707330,"name":"Carson Cooper","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/highres_254861845.jpeg","photo_id":254861845,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/member_254861845.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/7\/5\/thumb_254861845.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"New York Transcend Group Coaching","id":19724076,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Transcend-Group-Coaching","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Transcenders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458263503000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"politicalcafe","name":"Political Cafe","id":3334},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"critical-thinking","name":"Critical Thinking","id":15544},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-socials","name":"Coffee and Tea Socials","id":18105},{"urlkey":"vote","name":"Vote","id":19278},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"elections","name":"Elections","id":40198},{"urlkey":"national-politics","name":"National Politics","id":112476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Conversation-Group-Lets-Talk-About-Trump\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>***THIS IS NOT A PRO OR ANTI TRUMP GROUP.
