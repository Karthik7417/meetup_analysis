All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

This film, directed by Banmei Takahashi and starring Kantaro Nakamura, covers the whole of Dogen\u2019s life during a time of great upheaval in Japan.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The project would put our safety, our security, our marine environment and our climate at risk, and further drive the destructive practice of fracking for gas, and the local communities have voiced their strong opposition to the project time and time again.

Her work is based in a cosmology of healing that is known as the \"Tradition of the Grandmothers\"..... named because historically, one grandmother would share the practice with one granddaughter who would then go on to become the next practitioner. Renowned and respected for the ancestral wisdom she carries, Do\u00f1a openly shares ancient rituals, healing practices and Sacred Prayers from her community in the Mexican forests. In this workshop, she will guide us thru powerful rituals and techniques to deepen our awareness of the Healing Spirits in nature and further awaken our abilities to heal, purify, protect and Bless ourselves and our loved ones. Together we will dissolve limitations and welcome Joy. Please contact Robert Carris at [masked] for more information.<\/p> <p>Sarah Eve is a culinary shaman, making magic in the kitchen and healing from the heart. Sarah Eve began her shamanic studies with Izhak Beery and followed with the late Ipupiara, a Makunaiman of the Ure-e-wau-wau Amazonian tribe. She has completed workshops with Tom Cowan and the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. The path of healing also led her to work closely with the Santo Daime community, John of God, and crystal energy work in Brazil. Other international trips including Mexico and Central America, Europe, Israel, and Southeast Asia, she encountered sacred spiritual practices and healers in which she is blessed to share and teach. She completed her 200 &amp; 500 hour yoga training with Sri Dharma Mittra.

We thought that it would be fun to try this again. So in celebration of Halloween we will have a spooky foods murder mystery dinner. (Some effort in costume is required to join this, even if you slap something homemade together, let's be festive guys!)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why are we charging for this meetup? Please note that I am not profiting off of this dinner. The game and props costs money, and to make things interesting we will also have a cash prize for the person or people who solve the murder. Depending on how many people who attend the cash prize can be up to $175, yay! So get your thinking caps on and let's have fun. *Note: these games are not easy and we usually only have one winner so that is some pretty good holiday spending cash :-)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/5\/c\/600_442230300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>I know that this is after work so I will allow store bought foods at this event, but of course homemade foods are encouraged! If you do buy something from a store please make sure that it is spooky. You may arrive early 8PM and on to assemble your dish. Note that once the game starts you will not have time to assemble it.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><b>To participate you must bring at\u00a0least one spooky food. If you would like to drink with us please contribute a bottle of wine or cocktail as well. Please make sure to post what you will bringing to the party in the comments section below.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/7\/1\/d\/600_442230493.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Now for the game!<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>A vampire's death:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>To celebrate the opening of the scary new theme park, Vampireland in Transylvania, the guests have been chosen by Jack Ular, the owner of Castle Alucard and Vampireland, to take a frightening challenge. Their challenge, if they choose to accept, is to spend a night in one of the rooms in the haunted West Wing of Castle Alucard in Vampireland. If they successfully complete the challenge, and survive the night, they will each win the sum of $10,000 and will be awarded a Vampireland Medal of Bravery.<br\/><\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b><\/p> <p>How the game will work:<\/p> <p>Each member who signs up will be sent a character description, internal information about your character (Keep this a secret!), and costume\/ prop recommendations.<\/p> <p>During the party, each of you will be given clues. The clues provide all the information required to unlock the mystery. Each clue is designated as a clue to be concealed or a clue to be revealed. Conceal clues are generally information about your character that you try to hide (without lying) from the others.<\/p> <p>Reveal clues are ones that you should share with others in casual conversation. During the party, guests will mingle around asking questions about each others character and about clues you have received.As the game progresses, you will gather more and more information and at the end of the allotted time you will need to sift through fact and fiction to decide who is the murderer.<\/p> <p><br\/>The characters can be played to suit the comfort zone of each player. If you like the spotlight or enjoy role playing, immerse yourself in your character\u2019s persona and live the night as you think they would. You may even decide to exaggerate your character\u2019s personality for even more effect.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, if you prefer to participate in a less theatrical capacity, you may want to sit on the couch and let people come to you, approach each character off to the side or just listen in on other conversations until you get your feet wet and are feeling a bit more comfortable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Remember there are only three rules you need to do:\u00a0<br\/>1. Stay in Character\u00a0<br\/>2. Hide\/Stretch the truth, but don't lie!\u00a0<br\/>3. Interrogate others<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>By the way: The murder mystery dinner will run for approximately\u00a0[masked] hours so plan accordingly.<\/p> <p>Sign-ups for this meetup will close\u00a0two days before the scheduled event, so make sure you RSVP before then.<\/p> <p>You will have a chance to give your top two character choices when you RSVP on the questions form. Characters are assigned on a first come first serve basis.. You will also need to leave your email so that your character can be sent to you.

Let\u2019s celebrate Halloween, and the last long hiking day before spring by doing a fun hilly demanding 10 mile hike up Bear, West, Timp, and Bald Mountains. We will meet at the Manitou train station at 9:00, and then shuttle over to the parking lot on 9W near the Cornell trail. We will start the hike by hiking up the Cornel trail to the 77 tail, and then take the Major Welch trail up Bear Mountain, and then take the AT down Bear Mountain, and up West. On West Mountain we will then take the TT down West, and up the Timp. We will then take the Rd down the Timp, and up the backside of Bald Mountain. We will then take the C trail back to the cars. The hike will be about 10 miles with four good climbs, and will be a fun friendly, but demanding hike with a reasonable number of stops. Leader determines the pace, route, number of stops and duration of stops. If you want to run do not come. If you want to stroll chose another hike. This hike is not easy, and involves 3100 feet of elevation gain. No swimming. Bring at least 3 quarts of water your lunch and wear hiking boots. Rain Cancels. Trans. 5B, but take the Early Metro North Train that leaves 7:48 and arrives 8:58. Exit the train between the last two cars. (Check with Metro North because they are doing construction and the schedule might change).

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

First of all, thank you to all who attended our past \"Werewolf In the Park\" events, they've been great! For everyone else, it's never to late to get in on the fun -come one, come all, and tell your friends as well.<\/p> <p>On Saturday, October 31 (Halloween Day), we'll be returning to the event that is not unfamiliar to some of our members: Ultimate Werewolf in Fort Tryon Park. Ultimate Werewolf is a social game in which players are randomly assigned to one of two (or possibly more) teams: the villagers or the werewolves. The villagers must deduce who the werewolves are over a series of rounds using various techniques and social intrigue; this must be done before the werewolves are able to eliminate the villagers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Ultimate Werewolf, check out Tom Vasel's review at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ<\/a><\/p> <p>Ultimate Werewolf is the perfect game to play in an outdoor setting; just bring a folding chair or a picnic blanket and you're ready to go! All you need is the game (which I will supply) and the willingness to communicate with others. Since we'll be hosting this on Halloween day, feel free to wear your best Halloween costume! It's hard to tell what the weather will be like since we're posting this ahead of the date, but if the weather does not cooperate, we will try to find an alternate location or date. Also, if you do not know how to play Ultimate Werewolf, never fear, it is quite simple and several of us will be able to teach it to you within minutes; don't let that hold you back! We'll be meeting in Fort Tryon park, just north of Linden Terrace.

Fort Tryon Park's entrance is located on the elevated street level at the 190th street station on the A-train. We hope to see you there! Message me if you need more information. Beginners and experts welcome; even if you're not sure if you want to play, stop by to observe and introduce yourself!<\/p> <p>So bring along some tasty cider and donuts, or your favorite Halloween candy, and bundle up; let's get ready for our first (annual?)

Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm.

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs.

By volunteering, you\u2019re agreeing to stand on your feet from 7:00 am- 4:00 pm and help pass out water to runners, clean up cups and do other volunteer-y sorts of tasks. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. It could be cold, wet or windy\u2026or all three.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, you get to be part of an amazing event which features runners from all over the world coming to NYC for the most well known race on the planet.<\/p> <p>There are also lots of good beer places nearby so afterwards, we could all probably use a beer.<\/p> <p>So, if you think you can commit, here\u2019s what you need to do:<\/p> <p>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/mynyrr.nyrr.org\/login\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/mynyrr.nyrr.org\/login<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n-If you are a NYRR member and have a login, log in.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226295210\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpbcb","time":1446386400000,"updated":1446398820000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":5.09583377838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1370538278000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pickupsoccer-202\/events\/226200145\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"GAME","id":"dnkzcgytpbcb","time":1446386400000,"updated":1446398812000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1214915969000,"name":"Bay Ridge FC Get back in shape pickup soccer","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1206990,"urlname":"pickupsoccer-202","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10606","country":"us","city":"White Plains","phone":"914-686-9000","address_1":"200 Central Ave","name":"City Limits Diner","lon":-73.780175,"id":999703,"state":"NY","lat":41.036492,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":22.6720314026,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446069530000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-vintage-motorcycles\/events\/226380524\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":97200000,"name":"Bikes and Breakfast - November","id":"226380524","time":1446386400000,"updated":1446507740000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340482106000,"name":"Westchester vintage motorcycles","group_lon":-73.8000030518,"id":4151322,"urlname":"Westchester-vintage-motorcycles","group_lat":40.9900016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"West Street and North Moore","name":"Pier 25","lon":-74.012032,"id":1576885,"state":"NY","lat":40.720306,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":2.35855054855,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445950312000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This event is proudly brought to you by Soccer Beyond!<\/b><\/p> <p>Learn more on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/soccerbeyond.com\">SoccerBeyond.com<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond\">Facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Details\u00a0-\u00a0<i>Fun, interactive, effective.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>90min.

While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is emphasized to sensations in the body that are grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into vigorous strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/226321511\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytpbcb","time":1446397200000,"updated":1446410309000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":3.18494486809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445731739000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Announcement: As of today, I have and am still getting a lot of comments\/complaints regarding the details of this meet up.

We'll\u00a0then view Villa Lewaro, a palatial white stucco red-tiled roof mansion with 34 rooms.\u00a0Later on, we'll be going to the Lyndhurst Estate. Overlooking the Hudson River, the 67-acre\u00a0Lyndhurst Estate (named after the Linden trees planted on the estate) has a\u00a0Gilded Age, Gothic-style mansion, huge carriage house, two-lane bowling alley, rose garden, and greenhouse.\u00a0The Lyndhurst Estate has more\u00a0grassy lawn space than\u00a0medium-sized parks in NYC (including Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Below is Lyndhurst's\u00a0romantic rose garden where we will have lunch.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/d\/8\/600_438172184.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/e\/c\/600_438013036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We'll be having lunch at about 1:50 PM at the rose garden of the\u00a0picturesque Lyndhurst Estate. For lunchtime, bring a blanket or something to sit on the grass. There are not many benches or rocks to sit on around the estate. There also is no place to buy lunch at the Lyndhurst Estate. After we eat lunch, we'll explore the beautiful grounds of the Lyndhurst Estate.<\/p> <p><b>We don't have to pay to enter the grounds of the Lyndhurst Estate because there is no\u00a0admission fee for\u00a0those who walk in.<\/b> However,\u00a0those who drive into the estate\u00a0have to pay an admission fee of $5 per\u00a0person in the vehicle, but this fee does not apply on a weekday or in the winter months.<\/p> <p>Below is the Old Croton Aqueduct path with a ventilator.

Since we\u2019re meeting on Nov 1, Tamara thought it would be ideal to have a Samhain gathering that day. As many folks know, Samhain is the day when the veil between the worlds is not only its thinnest, but when it is actually lifted. It is a day when we honor our ancestors - both family and magical bloodlines, our loved ones and our pets who have crossed over. And because the veil is so thin, we take a lot of time to communicate with and divine with those who have crossed.<\/p> <p>Liz will be giving a brief talk on the history Samhain - as well as some of its modern day traditions. We are too large a group to perform a \u201cdumb supper,\u201d but Liz will describe it from the standpoint of a traditional Wiccan and will also share about mediumship and methods of communicating with the dead (Liz is mainly spiritualist trained, but have been a psychic medium since I was quite young). On Samhain, it is customary to dress up as goddesses, gods and the fae, because the fae are so intensely present during this point of the wheel of the year (the veil is at its thinnest both on Samhain and Beltaine - May 1). Feel free to dress up or just come as you are - witchy-ness and all. Liz will bring down her scrying tools (talking board, black mirror, crystal ball) and cards.

Manhattan. Sunday, November 1st @ 2:00PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for brave-hearted sailors to join us this chilly weekend for the last trip of the season!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site.

They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes! Please fill out the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible.\u00a0 If you are uncomfortable posting any of the information on your profile, please email your responses to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.\u00a0 Without a complete application, you will not be considered to receive an invitation.\u00a0 The trips last several hours, so we will have 20-30 people in a confined space for an extended period of time.

Also, we have extended this meeting time one more hour till 5pm because of the huge scope and details of Rebekah's research and to allow more time for a Q&amp;A, so the DNNY meeting will be running from 2pm to 5pm!<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b><b>Rebekah Roth<\/b> enjoyed a nearly thirty year airline career working as both a flight attendant and an international purser. She was trained as an emergency medical technician and served as a volunteer firefighter.<\/p> <p>Her expertise and training as a flight attendant allowed her to research the events of September 11, 2001, with an insider\u2019s knowledge that eventually lead her to discover details and answers to some of the most haunting questions surrounding that infamous day in our history.<\/p> <p>Rebekah enjoyed a very exciting life both in the air and on the ground and because of that, was encouraged by co-workers to write a book. As she began to do that, she discovered that ten of the accused 9\/11 hijackers were still alive. Several of them were also airline employees employed with Saudi Arabia Airlines and that they had had their identifications stolen years prior to 9\/11. At least four of the accused hijackers threatened to sue the U.S. Government and the FBI if they did not stop using their names and identities.<\/p> <p>That discovery, along with the refusal by the U.S. government to discontinue their false accusations, ignited her curiosity. After thousands hours of research, using official government documents, print and video media from 9\/11, and several books, Rebekah discovered that there were also at least two women involved in the 9\/11 event. Using her personal knowledge of in-flight procedures, FAA hijacking protocols, the state of Massachusetts and cell phone technology, she discovered yet to be exposed details concerning the planes, the passengers and the perpetrators which are woven into \u201c<b>Methodical Illusion\u201d<\/b>.<\/p> <p>In the months following the release of Methodical Illusion, Rebekah had several people contact her with more information that had never been made public, so she decided to weave that new information into a sequel and the <b>\u201cMethodical Deception\u201d<\/b> was born.<\/p> <p>The novel format helps the reader to learn about the FAA protocols and behaviors that would be expected by the flight crews, along with other information about people and corporations Rebekah discovered were involved in the planning or execution and\/or the financial gain from the fourteen years of wars in the Islamic countries of the Middle East.<\/p> <p>Rebekah's mission in choosing to write these books was to help the person who had never investigated 9\/11 or had always had some doubt about the official story, to see the event through the eyes of an airline professional as her main character, very much like herself wakes up to the truth and discovers what happened to the planes, the passengers and crew members that unforgettable day in our history.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Format:<\/b> The meeting will be done on either Skype and will start promptly at 2pm so please be on time.

So, if you're new to Stoicism, this is a great meetup for you to attend, whether or not you plan on participating in Stoic Week 2015!<\/p> <p>To prepare for this meetup, please <b>do the following<\/b>:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Sign up for <a href=\"http:\/\/modernstoicism.com\/\">Stoic Week 2015<\/a> if you are able to and want to participate (<b>you don't have to participate in Stoic Week 2015 to attend this meetup<\/b> though, as we're also having open discussion around Stoicism)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0If you signed up successfully, browse the \"<a href=\"http:\/\/modernstoicism.com\/course\/view.php?id=7&amp;section=1\">preliminary<\/a>\" section of the Stoic Week 2015 website, and read the introductory material of the Stoic Week 2015 Handbook (to be released October 31 in PDF, ePub, and HTML, up to but not including Monday's assignment)<\/p> <p>\u2022 Come prepared with any questions or discussion points you'd like to bring up for our open discussion period<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information about Stoic Week, please read <a href=\"http:\/\/philosophy-of-cbt.com\/2015\/10\/18\/why-stoic-week-matters\/\">this blog post<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Finally, please note that <b>Daylight Saving Time ends Sunday 11\/1 (the day of the meetup) at 2AM, so make sure you account for that!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Stoics\/events\/226162709\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"Introduction to Stoic Week 2015 (and Stoicism in General)","id":"226162709","time":1446408000000,"updated":1446511686000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357619798000,"name":"New York City Stoics","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6549102,"urlname":"New-York-City-Stoics","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Stoics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"BRONXVILLE","address_1":"CALL 914-482-0696 FOR LOCATION","name":"SALLY'S HOUSE","lon":0,"id":23478790,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":8,"distance":15.8842973709,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445985952000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/d\/d\/600_443551453.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>LET'S CONTINUE OUR HALLOWEEN CELEBRATION @ A POTLUCK AMIGO'S PARTY @ SALLY'S HOUSE.

Act I is set in British colonial Africa in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victorian_era\">Victorian era<\/a>, and Act II is set in a London park in 1979. However, between the acts only twenty-five years pass for the characters. Each actor plays one role in Act I and a different role in Act II - the characters who appear in both acts are played by different actors in the first and second. Act I parodies the conventional <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Comedy\">comedy<\/a> genre and satirizes Victorian society and colonialism. Act II shows what could happen when the restrictions of both the comic genre and Victorian ideology are loosened.<\/p> <p>The play uses controversial portrayals of sexuality and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obscene_language\">obscene language<\/a>, and establishes a parallel between colonial and sexual oppression.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cloud_9_%28play%29#cite_note-oxford-2\">[2]<\/a> Its humour depends on incongruity and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carnivalesque\">carnivalesque<\/a>, and helps to convey Churchill's political message about accepting people who are different and not dominating them or forcing them into particular social roles.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"F train to 7th Avenue Stop.
