We teach you how to tap into the power of desire, and untangle the often paralyzing societal conditioning around sex and connection.<\/p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt confused by a date's mixed messages, trapped by conflicting social scripts, defensive towards a girlfriend's anger, or just want to know how to break out of your shell and start having the sex and relationships you want\u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Come meet relationship and dating coaches from OneTaste NYC over coffee, ask us questions, and find out more about the courses we offer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n**OneTaste is an international organization devoted to bringing consciousness to the realm of human connection.**<\/p> <p>A coach will be at a table in the back room of Maman wearing a shirt saying \"Orgasm.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Text Dave at[masked] with any questions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OneTasteNewYork\/events\/227781740\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":3600000,"name":"Cracking the Intimacy Code: How to Connect with Women","id":"227781740","time":1452020400000,"updated":1452025028000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1251498220000,"name":"OneTaste New York","group_lon":-74,"id":1514451,"urlname":"OneTasteNewYork","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"You Must Register To Secure Your Spot ","name":"Online Webinar","lon":-73.94416,"id":24257333,"state":"NY","lat":40.678177,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.52385520935,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451770710000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/6\/e\/600_445558222.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>This event is brought to you by our global partner and sponsor<\/i>-\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/webinara.com\/\">Webinara<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>To Participate You Must Register In Advance To Secure Your Spot.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webinara.com\/webinars\/2016-guide-onboarding-offboarding-employees\/\"><b>CLICK HERE TO REGISTER\u00a0<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><b>ORGANIZER<\/b>:\u00a0MediaOps: DevOps\/ContainerJournal - Miles Blatstein\u00a0Twitter\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/devopsdotcom\">@devopsdotcom<\/a><\/p> <p><b>HOST:<\/b>\u00a0DevOps.com - Alan Shimel<\/p> <p><b>SPONSOR<\/b>:\u00a0JumpCloud - Greg Keller<\/p> <p><b>The 2016 IT Guide to Onboarding and Offboarding Employees\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><br\/>A step-by-step guide to help streamline your processes while keeping your company secure.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>You sit down to order lunch and your phone lights up, with numerous calls and texts flying in.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after.

devastatingly effective and versatile combative program that can easily stand alone, or augment your existing practice.\u00a0 The overarching focus is on responding to a threat spontaneously with natural, instinctive movement which strengthens and restores the body, clarifies the mind, and provides a framework for healthy, safe, life-long activity\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the

hopefully to be continued into a new series.<\/p> <p>The field of coaching, both the more general \"life coaching\" and the various forms of career coaching, has been a major vehicle for the contemporary dissemination of the Enneagram.\u00a0 While not as well known as the authors who first gave birth to and popularized the field (Ichazo, Naranjo, Riso, Palmer), in more recent decades a cohort of Enneagram authors who are themselves professional coaches has appeared - such as Mario Sikora, Ginger Lapid-Bogda, Mary Bast, among many others.<\/p> <p>In general, coaching with the Enneagram tends to stress more down-to-earth seeming applications of the system, apparently mainly because people in a business context may find overtly \"spiritual\" material to be overly threatening or otherwise inappropriate.<\/p> <p>One new member of our group who has ample professional experience in this field has been meeting with me recently to discuss how coaching actually works, along with some of the resources that are available.<\/p> <p>This evening, we will start taking a look at some simple self-coaching exercises, intended to spark insights into how we may be inspired to work on our professional lives (and, by extension, on our personal lives as well).\u00a0 No previous experience with coaching is needed, though any who may have such experience are particularly encouraged to attend.<\/p> <p>This is also a beginner-friendly topic for newcomers to our group who may be just getting into the Enneagram - those I haven't met are asked to please come to the meeting early, if possible.\u00a0 I'll be arriving at 6.30 at the Quest Bookshop, next door to our meeting-building at 240 E 53 (slightly below-ground) - please look for me there; if several new people come, we may head upstairs before 7.<\/p> <p>With Regards,<\/p> <p>Nicholas (Organizer)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/enneagram-4\/events\/226911333\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Enneagram as a Tool for Coaching (and Self-Coaching)","id":"qxnrkfyvcbhb","time":1452038400000,"updated":1452050904000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1066858789000,"name":"The New York Enneagram of Personality Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":54474,"urlname":"enneagram-4","group_lat":40.75,"who":"People Interested in Enneagram"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10801","country":"us","city":"New Rochelle","address_1":"130 Rhodes St","name":"The Rock Club","lon":-73.776817,"id":672561,"state":"NY","lat":40.917541,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.1015071869,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406835323000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come boulder at The Rock Club with Tim and Logan and enjoy new problems set every week! \u00a0It's always a blast, and we're always willing to help you out as a beginner or a pro!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/a\/2\/600_432351362.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYrockclimbing\/events\/227469475\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Tuesday Night Boulder Night!","id":"qwzzfkyvcbhb","time":1452038400000,"updated":1452050952000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1156012376000,"name":"The New York Metro Rock Climbing Meetup","group_lon":-73.7900009155,"id":308139,"urlname":"NYrockclimbing","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Rock Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10128","country":"us","city":"New York-10128","address_1":"Apt 15 A","name":"245 E93rd street","lon":-73.955772,"id":17163332,"state":"NY","lat":40.779819,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.735455513,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445958223000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this one hour introductory workshop you will learn powerful breathing techniques and do a guided meditation.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU!<\/p> <p><br\/>The last one was so much fun...we are doing it again!<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn to improve your photography through a gentle and honest interactive online photo critique led by professional photographer, Vickie Lewis.<\/p> <p>Here is the link to attend:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\"><a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;You can also dial in using your phone.<\/p> <p>United States\u00a0+1 (224)[masked]<\/p> <p>Access Code:\u00a0[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>The very best way to take your photography to the next level is to get personal feedback. These critiques are a great place to feel safe, talk about your work and get constructive feedback.<br\/>Vickie has been a full-time professional photographer and editor for over 30 years and has shot over 150 portraits for People Magazine. Her work is represented by The National Geographic image collection.<br\/>To assure personal attention during the critiques, we are going to limit the number of photographers being critiqued to five. Photographers being critiqued will be able to interact with Vickie and get their questions answered.<br\/>We\u2019ll using gotomeeting.com. It requires downloading a viewer on your computer. I will post the link to go meeting before December 10th.<\/p> <p>I've been doing critiques for a long time and realize that just listening can be educational too and so we are inviting all our Meetup group members to view the critiques for free.<br\/>The first five photographers who sign up to be critiqued will send 8-10 photos via email. Send your best, a recent shoot or something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. Due to time limitations, we probably won\u2019t critiqued all the photos each photographer submits, but we like to have a selection to look at to help you improve. We will make sure those who choose to participate get personal attention.<br\/>It doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something!<br\/>If you\u2019d like to have your photos critiqued, the price is $25 per person.<br\/>Go to this link to sign up:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=K88M9X3ASDRLG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=K88M9X3ASDRLG<\/a><\/p> <p>What past participants have said about critiques:<br\/>\"Fantastic! I was nervous about having my photos critiqued, but Vickie offered suggestions with gentleness and respect. It wasn't painful at all! Listening to her feedback, I had a great \"ah-ha\" moment about what I need to do to take my work to the next level. I'm so grateful to have had this opportunity to personally interact with a respected and experienced professional at such a bargain price. I will definitely do it again if the opportunity comes around again!\"<\/p> <p>\"I enjoyed the webinar and it was very informative. It made me look at my photos in a different way along with understanding focal point. I would take another webinar with Vickie. Thank you.\"<\/p> <p>\"I enjoyed this session very much. Vickie has such a good eye it's amazing! There was a nice balance between recommendations for improvement and pointing out what was good. We saw some outstanding photos, I hope the other photographers will post some of them.\"<\/p> <p>\u201cOnce again, our group provided a rewarding way to learn. Each one of our members showed interesting photographs, along with unique approaches to the subject matter. Vickie gave us valuable feedback, and it was the feedback that we all needed. If you want to belong to a social and educational photo Meetup, try this one!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cA very enjoyable evening. I learned a lot!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cGreat evening! It was good to see everyone and I enjoyed everyone's work. It very helpful to me get reactions from other folks to improve my pictures.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo interesting to see how cropping can move a photo from good to wow! A thoroughly enjoyable evening. Thanks for such an enjoyable discussion.\u201d<\/p> <p>Great feedback! Great to see other photographer's work and viewpoints.<\/p> <p>\u201cAll, thank you for a great experience and the great suggestions. I'm using them already and got many new ideas from all the wonderful photos.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cAs usual, I was impressed and inspired by everyone's photos. I also picked up a couple new tips, so it was a great night!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThank you all for a wonderful evening! Beautiful photos, great tips and a great group!

After 24 hours, if there are less than or equal to 4 people signed up I will move everyone to the going list and afterwards signing up will be like normal. If there are more than 4 people, I will give priority to those who have previously been on the waitlist and were not able to attend a prior meetup. I do sign ups this way so everyone has a chance to attend events. I know I tend to post things late at night and want morning people to also get to come to events.<\/p> <p><b>The Place: <\/b>Sister to soul-food spot Peaches, this Bed-Stuy poultry purveyor has a smaller space and shorter menu, but shares the focus on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients. The interior, like the food, centers on nostalgia for simpler things: A cloud-gray room hosts wraparound picnic-style benches, and a scuffed hardwood floor complements a down-home service style. The kitchen doles out a collection of the usual high-end rib-stickers: sweet slabs of cornbread that taste more like cake; fried green tomatoes dressed with sprigs of arugula, barbecue mayo, and thick strips of bacon; large, juicy shrimp covered in mild barbecue sauce over fried-grits cubes; a bowl of creamed corn garnished with that same wonderful bacon. House cocktails that lean on bourbon, mashed blueberries, and sweet tea make for excellent chasers. Peaches' fare isn't always exceptional: Shrimp and grits with plainclothes Cheddar lacks any discernible kick, and greens, like a bland side bowl of saut\u00e9ed kale, play second string. The kitchen\u2019s famous fried-chicken plate, on the other hand, consists of three pieces stacked over a slab of white bread and dusted with a spice so red it almost glows. While the \u201chot\u201d variety is surprisingly mild, the \u201cextra hot\u201d option warrants a special note: Try it if you dare, but don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>RSVPs: <\/b><\/p> <p>Please do not RSVP No. You only need to RSVP if you want to come to the event.<\/p> <p>Please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can go. I notice the people who RSVP and then cancel, which is not fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Even if the meetup is full, please put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. If there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to be able to do so. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

Many people are also aware of using EFT for physical well being. Sometimes we need to look at the emotional aspects that may be behind the issues of concern, and sometimes we just tap directly on the symptoms and notice if we get relief just from that. Its very nice when this happens and it happens a lot.<\/p> <p>Tong Ren is another form of healing using tapping but unlike EFT it doesnt involve any dialog to describe the issues of concern. We just tap on a surragate model (Tong Ren) as if we were doing acupunture on a real body with intention of healing and it works!!!!<\/p> <p>We'll meet at Jain's home in Scarsdale every 2nd and 4th Tuesday evening and whoever is interested in joining us is welcome.

How likely is it?<\/p> <p>Our lifestyle and civilization rely on steady supplies of electricity and an electricity grid was created to supply that electricity. Our society is increasingly reliant on computers and the grid is no exception to that. There have been several articles online about the grid being vulnerable to a cyber-attack and how a dam in Rye, NY did indeed get a cyber-attack. So did a portion of the grid in California. Is the Indian Point nuclear plant vulnerable as well?<\/p> <p>I will explore that with Michel Lee, who has been studying just how vulnerable the grid is. Michel is Chair of the Council on Intelligent Energy &amp; Conservation Policy (CIECP) and on the Steering Committee of the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition (IPSEC).

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

It\u2019s about designing a system of\u00a0constraints for people to ask the right questions, find purpose in their work,\u00a0and be empowered to make decisions and\u00a0constantly learn &amp; improve\u00a0through\u00a0experimentation and failure.<\/p> <p>\u201dLearning organizations are organizations\u00a0where people continually expand their capacity to design for the results they\u00a0truly desire;\u00a0where new and expansive mindsets are nurtured, where collective\u00a0aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to\u00a0see the\u00a0whole together instead of optimizing for the parts.\u201d \u2013 Peter Senge<br\/>\u00a0\nWhen people talk about the\u00a0application of Lean principles to knowledge work like software, what\u00a0immediately comes to mind?\u00a0Perhaps \u201cvisualize your work,\u201d using visual\u00a0management systems like Kanban? Perhaps the idea of removing waste from the\u00a0system\u00a0to increase flow of value? While both of these are incredible powerful\u00a0tools, many software companies believe that simple installing\u00a0Kanban boards\u00a0will move their organization forward.

Space is limited -- be sure to purchase your ticket here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCJan6\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCJan6\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/BSCEFCJan6<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>===========================================\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Knowing how to effectively measure the impact of your work in the social sector enables you to powerfully tell your story to donors and stakeholders alike, as well as constantly improve the services you offer. Whether you are looking to advance your career or focus on helping your current organization become stronger, you will leave with the skills you need to measure your impact.<\/p> <p>All 6-week courses will be conducted through hands-on activities, out-of-class assignments, and readings. Using a small class size model ensures that all students get one-on-one time with trainers. Students should expect to spend 2-3 hours each week outside of class completing readings and assignments. This course is ideal for individuals with little to no evaluation and data experience. The six-week course covers the following topics in detail:<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 1 (Jan. 6): Understanding the Power of Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Explore the broad reasons for engaging in evaluation in order to understand the power that data can deliver to your organization. This session provides students a high-level overview of the evaluation cycle. Learn why using data-driven practices are important and leave knowing how to articulate how the social sector can leverage data to measure their impact.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 2 (Jan. 13): Assessment Phase &amp; Logic Models<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Dissecting programs through a critical analysis helps to articulate the core components of any initiative, including inputs, outputs, and expected outcomes \u2013 also known as conducting a Logic Model or Theory of Change.\u00a0 Determine what data you already track and what data still needs to be collected for each component. Explore the complementary aspects of regular data collection, and targeted, periodic evaluation.<\/p> <p><b><i>Week 3 (Jan. 20): Transforming Programming into Measureable Outcomes &amp; Outputs<\/i>\u00a0<\/b>Want to make sure your measurement tools are as efficient as possible? First, you need to make sure you are asking the right questions. In this training, we start by breaking down your program\u2019s purpose and mission. Throughout the process we train nonprofit professionals to be strategic when designing an evaluation. Participants will leave with a set of variables\/indicators to be used in a survey or interview and discuss how they could be best measured.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 4 (Jan. 27): Designing Measurement Tools Using a Mixed-Methods Approach<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Sometimes, numbers can give you a good indication of how well an organization is doing, but it\u2019s not always the whole story. Organizations need to also support evidence of their impact with humanizing stories and real-world anecdotes of how their program changes lives. Explore the complementary aspects of quantitative and qualitative research and be ready to address your own biases!\u00a0 Learn about mixed methods approaches and how to develop measurement tools that actually capture the results you are looking to measure.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 5 (Feb. 3): Organizing, Managing, and Analyzing Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Once you have collected your data, the next step is to take it from raw data to aggregate results. It is imperative to value the methodologies of this process over simply obtaining advanced statistical technological programs. Learning how to handle your data and manage any pitfalls that occurred during the implementation phase will help you maximize the data you have collected.\u00a0 This will also mitigate the effects of any less-than-perfect implementations. Learn more advanced methodologies to help you ensure your analysis is sound and impress stakeholders.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 6 (Feb. 10): Storytelling Using Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Having aggregate data of your evaluation is not enough. This session will teach you how to craft this data in a format that effectively conveys your true impact. Understanding how to present your results to a variety of audiences ensures your efforts are communicated in the best light. Learn how to take your results to the next level by analyzing your audience and customizing your data to convince all stakeholders that you are making a real impact.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0<\/a><\/p> <p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.evaluateforchange.com\/\"><b>Evaluate for Change<\/b><\/a>, we are dedicated to shifting the social sector towards a more data-driven and results-oriented industry, all while remembering people are more than just numbers!

YEP! is a hybrid networking organization. At one time the co-founders were members of NY MPI, NY EPA, NY ISES, NY NACE, NY ABC, DC ISES, DC NACE, and NYC &amp; Company. They adopted the best practices of each of those organizations to maximize the growth and effectiveness of YEP!. We welcome all suggestions and debate. It is likely that we have considered a number of policies and procedures before selecting the most appropriate for YEP!.<\/p> <p>2. YEP! is an LLC that\u00a0minimizes overhead. The purpose of YEP! is to create new leadership opportunities for event professionals, provide quality low-cost events, and help members in their careers and businesses. Because we don't have employees, or high monthly expenses, events just have to break even. Plus, there is no membership fee.<\/p> <p>3. Everyone is welcome, everyone is welcome back and everyone is included. The most important part of genuine networking is participation, either as leaders or attendees at our events. We welcome all of our attendees to be participants at our events and on our leadership board. We find opportunities for all those who wish to serve. Our terms of leadership are only six months.<\/p> <p>4. There are no advisory positions. Leaders either embrace an on-going responsibility or assume significant responsibility for an event. Our leaders are given\u00a0a platform and a space from which they can showcase their abilities and the abilities of other sponsors and individuals. We are not limited to one event per month. We are only limited by our imagination and ability to organize.<\/p> <p>Requirements for Board Members<\/p> <p>1. Attendance at monthly meetings. Meetings are the first Wednesday of each month in Manhattan, 6:30 - 8 p.m. We realize leaders might have other more pressing obligations and miss a meeting on occasion.

Whether you are looking to connect with a loved one who has recently passed or to receive messages from spirit, our group offers a warm and friendly environment to all who are interested. Before each s\u00e9ance we begin our group with a 15 minute lesson on psychic development, covering topics from psychic impressions to spirit communication. We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

We'll do out best to cancel meetups on holidays and days the space won't be available but you should also double check before coming out.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0While there are snacks and drinks at the space, lunch is not provided. There are a number of restaurants, delis and other places to get food in the area so plan accordingly<\/p> <p>\u2022 These daily coworking events are self run. A co-organizer will not always be at the event. These events are designed to give game developers a free space to work so you'll basically be left alone at the space to do you own thing. We suggest reaching out to other attending through the comments to sit together or meet up at a specific time in the space.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLast thing, two times a month we'll have a dedicated space for you to come out and work as well as listen to talks and get help from myself and others in the community. Those will be different events you'll need to register for which are separate from the daily co-working space.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/227497940\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":28800000,"name":"Indie Coworking Space","id":"htvgmlyvcbkb","time":1452178800000,"updated":1452208728000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":15.2683267593,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438116599000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's get the kiddies together and do some arts and crafts!

Learning to master a single light set-up is useful for shooting on location, where you don't have the time or space for a full set-up.<\/p> <p>We will explore both studio style images and environmental portraits where you work with the light in your location and add a single key light to control color and quality on your subject.<\/p> <p>Learn: How one light can act as 3 with a little creative placement.<\/p> <p>Learn: Various go-to modifiers for the one light portrait shooter.<\/p> <p>Learn: Techniques for both Speedlight and Large flash portraiture.<\/p> <p>There will be three sessions, each covering different modifiers.

Club Macanudo is considered the Rolls Royce of the free cigar lounges in NYC. This is very stylish with a bar &amp; lounge in the front room &amp; a dining room in the back. They do have a very selective cigar menu but it is very pricey. I do suggest to bring your own cigars. There is a cutting fee and the price depends on where you are seated. This is a fantastic place which we have used many times with large turnouts. Please be aware that they do check dress attire here and will not let you enter if they feel you don't make the standards. I suggest : no jeans, no sneakers ,button down shirts for men &amp; just look neat. They do have a reaturant menu here where you can eat at the bar, lounge or dining room. If you plan to sit anywhere but the bar, make sure you asked for any minimum or cover chargers at the tables so you are aware of any fees. Want to get a good start for 2016?

Campos<\/p> <p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<br\/>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<br\/>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from\u00a0these Luso-African countries.<br\/>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England.\u00a0<br\/>Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<br\/>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<br\/>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<br\/>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing. A moment when the woman's beauty, enhanced by her partner, must embody all its essence. \" D.

Each session with a client or couple is about 45 minutes.<\/p> <p>What is a peer counselor? The word, \"peer\", means \"equal\". In this usage, a counselor and a client are on level ground. The counselor is not a therapist and does not provide professional therapy.<\/p> <p>As peers, we have the opportunity to share as equals with our clients. This means that, unlike therapists, we can share our personal experiences, so that the client knows there are others who have been through a similar situation.<\/p> <p>What does a peer counselor do? Using active listening skills, empathy, and the sharing of experiences, the counselors help clients clarify their thoughts and feelings; and explore various options or solutions.<\/p> <p>What else can the counselors do? Sometimes clients just come in to talk and that's all they need, but if clients feel that they might benefit from <b>referrals<\/b> to other resources, the counselor will discuss with them: <b>short-term peer counseling<\/b> (8 weekly, 1-hour one-on-one visits), <b>therapists<\/b>, <b>discussion groups<\/b>, and <b>other community resources<\/b>.<\/p> <p>Our outreach is supported by donations from Identity House members and our clients.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals.

PLEASE SUGGEST!<\/p> <p>Welcome and thanks for joining. This new Thursday meetup is here to support your poetic side. Rather than critique, we will discuss our poetic work; share feelings, and grow as poets or as writers who love being poetic. We will explore how you can be true to your poetic sensibilities and be understood, or not, as may be appropriately applicable and then emphatically, take it to a higher level. Discussion will be on our posted work. We will also look at what others are saying about poetic prose and poetry, as well as the writing of published poets. And help you along to achieve your goals. As with the Monday and Wednesday groups we will be setting goals and discussing the craft. Our agenda is as follows:<\/p> <p>7:00 - 7:05 - Chat<\/p> <p>7:05 - 7:20 - Intros, 7:20 - 7:50 - Set writing goals for upcoming week &amp; share potential obstacles and how to overcome them.<\/p> <p>7:50 - 8:30 - Discussion of submitted works: One or two writers chosen at preceding meeting will submit.
