He sets out from Los Angeles on a vintage motorbike, determined to circumnavigate the globe surviving only on the kindness of strangers. Incredibly, he makes his way across the U.S., through Europe, India, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and finally to Canada and back to the Hollywood sign, by asking strangers for shelter, food, and gas. Again and again, he\u2019s won over by the generosity of humanity, from the homeless man who shares his blanket to the poor farmer who helps him with his broken down bike, and the HIV-positive mother who takes him in and feeds him. At each stop, he finds a way to give back to these unsuspecting Good Samaritans in life-changing ways, by rebuilding their homes, paying for their schooling, and leaving behind gifts big and small.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

Bill will discuss his new book, Sacred Knowledge: Psychedelics and Religious Experiences, due out in December, and recent results in spiritual and therapeutic studies on psilocybin.<\/p> <p>Bill is a clinical psychologist with formal training in theology and comparative religion. In addition to his private psychotherapy practice he conducts research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Among his many studies, Bill has looked at the medical potential of the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin, the active ingredient in \u2018magic mushrooms.\u2019<\/p> <p>He\u2019s part of the research team at the Johns Hopkins Medical School who are studying whether psilocybin-assisted\u00a0psychotherapy can help people with cancer better cope with the psychological impact of their condition. They\u2019ve also examined whether psilocybin can assist in smoking cessation, and if it can enhance the benefits of meditation.<\/p> <p>From Columbia University Press:<\/p> <p><i>Sacred Knowledge<\/i> enriches humanities and scientific scholarship, expanding work in philosophy, anthropology, theology, and religious studies, as well as in mental health, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology. Richards\u2019s analysis also contributes to social and political debates over the responsible integration of psychedelic substances into modern society. His book is an invaluable resource for readers who, whether spontaneously or with the facilitation of psychedelics, have encountered meaningful, inspiring, or even disturbing states of consciousness and seek clarity about their experiences. Testing the limits of language and conceptual frameworks, Richards makes the most of experiential phenomena that stretch our concepts of reality and advances new frontiers in the study of belief, spiritual awakening, psychiatric treatment, and social well-being.<\/p> <p>Copies of <i>Sacred Knowledge<\/i> will be available for sale and signature by the author.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Take I-695 to x19 route 795 North.

For people who have taken the original spoon bending class, \"The Alchemy of Spoon Bending,\" they have experienced first hand that techniques based on energy can soften the metal of spoons and forks enough so that what was not easily bent using physical force becomes miraculously malleable and easily bent.<\/p> <p>To get an idea of how difficult it is to bend a fork, you can get any ordinary fork and attempt to bend the tines. Even the strongest person will have difficulty bending most tines on forks. Using these techniques, the metal becomes easily bent by anyone particularly children. The above fork was completely bent in its final shape using the new quantum technique once.<\/p> <p>So why hold a spoon bending class? It is not about bending spoons and forks. The change in material reality as demonstrated by the bent forks is a model for change. The mechanisms tested are energy and quantum mechanics techniques.<\/p> <p>Because the worldview of energy and quantum mechanics is relatively new to modern life, it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate to people this reality; however, when people directly change their reality when they bend spoons and forks, their minds have direct physical proof that something changed in physical reality. Not only do they have direct proof; but, the proof happens to be what is considered one of the most \u201csolid\u201d aspects of physical reality.<\/p> <p>What is really exciting is that the fork in the above picture was bent not using the model of energy as taught in the previous class called the \"Alchemy of Spoon Bending\" but using techniques based on quantum mechanics and the unified field. The specific technique used for the fork above was called time travel in which I took the fork and sent it back in time to a condition where it would most easily bend in the above conformation. Voila. How cool is that!<\/p> <p>However, not only are the results cool but these same principles can be used for major shifts in healing and change. Some healers have been shown to mend broken bones instantaneously. Now people can get a direct experience as to how this might be possible and also how they can perform miracles in their daily life too. The principles demonstrated in this class access the same field of information as these miraculous healers.<\/p> <p>This technique plus at least nine more will be taught in the all new class called Quantum Spoon Bending. The class will include the following techniques: 1) Accessing the Field 2) Torus of the Heart 3) Time Travel 4) Dimensions 5) Spinning 6) Resonance 7) Frequency 8) Symbols 9) Embedding Intention (ie. Talisman Making) and the original technique 10) Accessing the Light.<\/p> <p>It is a \"quantum\" shift above the original class called the \"Alchemy of Spoon Bending\" which still contains important concepts in energy medicine. The original technique taught in the Alchemy class will be shown in the new class, plus the wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics as applied to healing and transformation. Each technique will be taught so that participants will have time to use the technique to bend the utensils. Then ample time will be given to show how each technique can be used in self-transformation and healing and to demonstrate the larger implications of each quantum concept.<\/p> <p>Early registration is important in order to provide adequate amount of materials.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i><b>The cost is $55 and is limited to 20 people.

In addition, he teaches a number of seminars that focus on the integration of science, spirituality, and healing. Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\">www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donuts driveway: Nourishing Journey, LLC is behind Dunkin Donuts, 3rd doorway on the right","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/221872745\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":9000000,"name":"Quantum Spoon Bending: a Model for Healing and Transformation","id":"221872745","time":1449703800000,"updated":1449713863000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21042","country":"us","city":"Ellicott City","address_1":"4300 Centennial Lane","name":"Centennial High School Room 406","lon":-76.867225,"id":6732522,"state":"MD","lat":39.253001,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":54,"headcount":0,"distance":13.4957838058,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444578280000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>What this course is about: <\/b>We will be holding an 6-week Introduction to Buddhist Principles and Practices course starting Wednesday November 4.

This word was invented by the maker of\u00a0<i>TriBond<\/i>\u00a0to describe the three word clues the players must analyze and determine what all three have in common. Some of the threezers are not difficult while others are quite challenging. \u00a0<i>TriBond<\/i>\u00a0can be played by individual players or teams. Each game comes with 12 game pieces, three for each team. \u00a0 \u00a0All players place each of their three-game pieces on the starting points for each track. Two dice are used, one being a regular, numbered dice and the other a category dice. A player rolls the dice and one of the opposing players will read to them the threezer for the category they rolled. If they are able to guess the common bond they will advance one of their game pieces the number of spaces rolled on the numbered die and continue playing until they answer incorrectly.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If the player lands on a green challenge square they can 'challenge' another player who's ahead of them in one of the three tracks.\u00a0\u00a0A third player will read the challenge threezer to the challenger and the player he challenged. Whoever shouts out the correct answer first wins the challenge. If the challenger wins, he gets to swap places on the board with the other player, otherwise both player's pieces remain as they are. Challenging is not always possible; If the player is ahead on all three tracks there is no point in offering a challenge to another player. \u00a0The first player or team to move all their game pieces around the tracks wins the game.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThat's a longish explanation but I've tried to edit it down a bit. \u00a0Hope to see you there.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for us in our usual spot by the food pick-up area.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boardgames-543\/events\/227097590\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Let's Try Tri-Bond","id":"227097590","time":1449705600000,"updated":1449713896000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1207503530000,"name":"The Anne Arundel Boardgames Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1099209,"urlname":"boardgames-543","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Game Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":23.2791748047,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449041530000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Text your name and \"FitNation\" to[masked] for the address to our nutrition club \ud83d\ude09<\/p> <p>Open for all fitness levels!!

Every month (really, every day), we are faced with new opportunities, new energies, that can renew us! Each month, we have the ability to take control over the energetic and astrological influences of the coming month.<\/p> <p>THIS MONTH, the New Moon of Sagittarius (Kislev) offers us an entirely different energy than previous months. With certainty, we have the opportunity to create openings for miracles to enter our lives. Sometimes the greatest miracle of all is simply the ability to change our perception and consider a world in which miracles are the natural order of life.<\/p> <p>The New Moon in Sagittarius is a Mutable and Fire sign, fun, radiant and visionary. It is a time of new beginnings. It is the time to heal, not just physically but also, your experiences and relationships. It deals with imagination, confidence being open-hearted and optimistic about the future and life. Sagittarius rules the quest for the truth through prayer, meditation, higher learning, and being direct and honest.<\/p> <p>PRIOR TO OUR CIRCLE,\u00a0mentally and\/or in your journal, make a manifestation wish list of what you would like to learn that would make your life easier. Ask yourself:<br\/>What do you really believe?<br\/>What is your truth?<br\/>What do you believe is possible for you?<br\/>What needs healing? Does your heart need healing?<br\/>What is it that you aspire to?<br\/>Is your spiritual path ready for an overhaul?<br\/>How do I nurture and develop my creative talents?<br\/>How am I honored by those close to me?<br\/>What new gifts am I ready to express in this world?<br\/>Can I go with the flow?<br\/>Do I look outside of myself if I feel restricted?<br\/>Who am I inviting into my life? Why?<br\/>Am I looking at life from the broader perspective?<\/p> <p>During the New Moon of Sagittarius, miracles and light sound us from every direction. It is a time to both recognize every day miracles, and to draw in miracles through our thoughts and actions.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\">www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donut Driveway.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/225708267\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"PRESENCE HEALING SESSIONS with Gene Ang, Ph.D.","id":"225708267","time":1449788400000,"updated":1449800374000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"20707","country":"us","city":"Laurel","address_1":"13800 Old Gunpowder Road","name":"The Gardens Ice House","lon":-76.921547,"id":7869032,"state":"MD","lat":39.081657,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.6777820587,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430779130000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Waiver:<\/b> Mountain biking is a risky sport, By signing up for this meetup you are agreeing to our waiver located here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Led by our good friend Jesse, please contact him for any questions.

Done incorrectly, humor can be a disaster. Executed correctly, humor lightens the load, eases the burden and releases tension. There are three basic methods for adding humor to a speech: Tell a canned joke, tell an original joke or simply make a wry observation.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Method #1: Canned Jokes<br\/>The beauty of a canned joke is that it has usually withstood the test of time. For someone just starting to add humor, this is the best technique. By telling an old standby, you can concentrate on timing and delivery \u2013 two of the major keys to being funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery:<\/b> This refers to the way you present a joke. These two ideas may be the most important aspects of humor. As Toastmasters, we know that communication is more than just words. When you deliver a joke, your attitude alone can make or break the punch line.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But you have to get over the idea that you have to be perfect. Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to laugh.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of our newer members served as Toastmaster for the first time. She opened with a joke, stumbling through it. Even though she had to read the joke and even apologized to us ahead of time for her lack of experience, she told the joke with a smile and a wink. We laughed!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Audacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears. Just say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m terrified. I might botch the punch line, I might forget the entire joke; maybe no one will laugh. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway. It will be hard this first time, but easier the next and the next and the next.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The basic keys to adding humor to your speech are:<\/p> <p>relevance, and<\/p> <p>unexpected insight<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say you were doing a talk about ESPN or sports fanatics or even just sports in general. You might try the following \u201cused\u201d joke:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cA sports-buff showed up at the sold-out football game. He took his seat on the 50-yard line and then gently placed a woman\u2019s coat and an extra ticket on the seat next to him. The spectator behind him asked, \u201cAre you saving that seat for someone?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man said, \u201cNo. It would have been for my wife, but she\u2019s passed on.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d the spectator said. Then he added, \u201cGosh, why didn\u2019t you give that extra ticket to a friend?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man turned around with a surprised look on his face and said, \u201cAll my friends are at the funeral.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This joke is obviously\u00a0<i>relevant<\/i> to a sports-oriented talk. It sets the theme of the speech and warms up the audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The <i>insight<\/i> is that we sometimes get so wrapped up in our own stuff that we forget about other people. We all do it. This guy just did it bigger and that makes it funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Try out this joke (or any other) on several friends. Practice timing the punch line. Try different wording to make it your own. Try out different pacing, pausing in various places for emphasis. Like any other skill, you learn to tell a joke by practicing. Most people who claim they don\u2019t know any jokes are simply saying that they haven\u2019t practiced any.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most canned jokes are generic and you don\u2019t have to attribute your source. However, if you are relating something specific to a certain comedian, you should give proper credit. Use your best judgment. You may want to say something like, \u201cAs Steve Martin so aptly put it: \u2018The new phone book is here! The new phone book is here!\u2019\u201d But don\u2019t start your joke with \u201cI got this off the Internet...\u201d Just launch into it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Once you become comfortable telling jokes you\u2019ve found from other sources, take your humor up a notch by trying out some original material.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Method #2: New Material<br\/>There is a basic three-point structure you can follow to create your own, original material:<\/p> <p>Come up with a topic,<\/p> <p>Add a premise, and<\/p> <p>Turn it around.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works: First, come up with a topic. For example, if you are a parent, you might want to make a joke about being a father or a mother. Here\u2019s a caveat. If you are a woman, don\u2019t choose the topic of being a father. The audience won\u2019t be able to relate through you.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cSometimes a witty observation will produce no more<br\/>than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye. That\u2019s enough.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Next, create a premise. Let\u2019s say you are making a joke about being a dad. Your premise might be that it\u2019s hard to be a dad. Or, that having kids makes men a bit stupid. Or weird. Or that having kids is scary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Comedy trainer Judy Carter uses those four specific words when she is training people to be funny. She calls them \u201cattitude\u201d words. When you are just beginning to experiment with writing your own material, it is best to stick with the basics:<\/p> <p>Algebra homework is hard.<\/p> <p>Skateboarding on the highway is stupid.<\/p> <p>Being a dad is weird.<\/p> <p>Being tall around toddlers is scary.<\/p> <p>The third part is the hard part. You have to bring in the unexpected. For instance, if you are working with \u201cskateboarding on the highway is stupid,\u201d and you were being serious, you might finish with how dangerous it is. For a joke, look for insight. Look for pain.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, let\u2019s look at a concrete example:<\/p> <p><b>Step one:<\/b> Choose a topic. Let\u2019s say you chose \u201cparenting.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step two:<\/b> Choose an attitude. For example, \u201craising kids is hard.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step three:<\/b> Create a twist. First of all, what is hard about raising kids?<\/p> <p>Maybe your answer is that you have to be more mature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, think of a way to twist that around to surprise the audience. Here is how I used this topic to open my speech on traveling.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cTraveling with kids is hard! You gotta be tough, you know?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We just got back from Disney World. We spent all day walking and it was hot and it was like, \u2018I need a drink of water, and \u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 and \u2018I need to go potty.\u2019\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, my six-year old put her hands on her hips and said, \u2018Dad, quit whining.\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery, Part II.<\/b> Practice makes perfect. Although great material always sounds like it is impromptu, it rarely is. With jokes, more than with anything else, practice is imperative. You have to practice until it sounds as if you are just making it up on the spot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Record your joke delivery and then listen. After a while, you will get a good feel for the pace. You will hear where the pauses work and where they don\u2019t. Along the way, you\u2019ll memorize the joke. It will also stop sounding funny to you. Don\u2019t worry; your audience has never heard it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In my travelogue about Florida, I tell a story about my five-year old.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cKids are wise, aren\u2019t they? My five-year old son played in the sprinklers at the park and on the ride back to our condo, he took off all his clothes. He got out of the car and everyone stared at him as he walked down the street, naked as can be. JoAnn and I were mortified, of course, but he just looked around and said, \u2018Well, at least I\u2019m wearing sun block!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This story stopped being funny to me a long time ago, but whenever I tell it, everyone guffaws.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Rule of Three<\/b><br\/>Three is an inherently funny number. Just make a list of three things. Throw out the last one and replace it with something outlandish. A word, a phrase. A dead fish.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s take the simple topic of sun block and play it out.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cSun block is weird. (notice the attitude word) My wife packs SPF 44. Sun protection factor 44. Do you know what that means? That means that we can stay out in the sun 44 times longer with it on. Where are we going anyway? The Mojave Desert? The Sahara? The planet Mercury?\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Acting Out<\/b><br\/>Take your humor up another notch...act it out. Now take your rant against sun block and play it out even further:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cHave you ever noticed that the companies that make sun block make bug repellent too? You have to have both because they make the sun block smell like Pi\u00f1a Coladas. Of course it\u2019s going to attract bugs. They\u2019re like \u2018Yeah baby! It\u2019s cocktail hour!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Surviving the Joke<\/b><br\/>If you\u2019ve practiced your jokes and bounced them off the right people ahead of time, you\u2019re sure to get some laughs. Even so, the day will come when the audience just doesn\u2019t get it. There are two ways to deal with the \u201cbomb:\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>One is the \u201csaver.\u201d Powerhouse speaker J.R. Ridinger sometimes gets going so fast and furious that he leaves the audience behind. His favorite saver: \u201cMaybe that one will catch you on the way home.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The other technique is to just keep on keeping on. One of my all-time favorite inspirational speakers once gave a sermon on sex. The funny quotes she told at the beginning left the audience speechless. She handled her choice of material like a true professional, never missing a beat, though I squirmed and turned a bit red.\u00a0<br\/>Listening to this professional also showed me how confidence and audacity can pull off a joke that a less confident person could never get away with.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Method #3: Wry Observations<br\/><i>Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.<\/i> \u2013 Mark Twain\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of the great masters of the witty statements, Mark Twain once said that electric lights were to humor as lightning was to wit. In other words, unlike a joke that has a story-line, natural wit usually comes out as a pointed, wry observation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Use the triple-A method to develop your ability to make witty statements. First, be\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ware, then add\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ttitude and\u00a0<b>A<\/b>llow yourself to grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Be aware<\/b> by understanding that humor comes from understanding shared experiences, especially painful ones. In order to fully cultivate your own sense of humor, you have to stop seeing your life as completely tragic. We all have troubles. Open your eyes and your mind and watch for the irony and the contrast in life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your attitude will help you be funny. Watch any great comedian, male or female. Some are gutsy and loud, some are meek and shy. You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Finally, allow yourself to be funny. Open your mouth and try. Toastmasters is the perfect place to nurture your inner comic. Occasionally you may tell a stinker. Get over it and try again. Progress only comes with practice in front of real people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You don\u2019t have to elicit a roar of laughter from your audience. Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye.\u00a0<\/p> <p>That\u2019s enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember that Toastmasters is a learning organization. Give yourself permission to try, and trust that your fellow members are either (a) wishing they were as brave as you and respecting you for it, (b) about in the same\u00a0<\/p> <p>place on the progress curve as you are and respecting you for it, or (c) re-living the time they first tried humor and respecting you for doing the same.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, get out there. Be yourself, be happy and be confident. Long after your listeners have forgotten the content of your speech, they will still remember how you made them feel.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Historic Oliver's Carriage house is located at 5410 Leaf Treader Way, Columbia, MD.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/patuxent-toastmasters\/events\/226261454\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters leadership and communication skills meeting.","id":"226261454","time":1449793800000,"updated":1449800514000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346087629000,"name":"Patuxent Toastmasters","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4652422,"urlname":"patuxent-toastmasters","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"toasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21114","country":"us","city":"Crofton","address_1":"1657 Crofton Parkway","name":"Prince of Peace Presbyterian","lon":-76.695786,"id":9463082,"state":"MD","lat":39.007793,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.9575214386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421544815000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This week Single Again Crofton Coordinator, Mary Woznysmith, LCSW-C will be speaking on the topic <b>Stress Reduction at the Holidays\u00a0.<\/b><\/p> <p>Orientation Meeting begins at 7:00 PM for new members<\/p> <p>Regular Meeting begins at 7:30 PM<\/p> <p>Then there will be small-group break-out sessions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainCrofton\/events\/223566270\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":6300000,"name":"Single Again - Crofton","id":"gsbwdlytqbnb","time":1449793800000,"updated":1449801917000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282432684000,"name":"Changing Focus - Single Again in Crofton","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1694643,"urlname":"SingleAgainCrofton","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21144","country":"us","city":"Severn","address_1":"512 Shaw Court Unit 105","name":"Unallocated Space","lon":-76.668846,"id":3632282,"state":"MD","lat":39.148037,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.1718139648,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1353100770000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For beginning and advanced developers alike, web night is a weekly event designed to offer resources to developers and those wishing to learn web development.

In addition, he teaches a number of seminars that focus on the integration of science, spirituality, and healing. Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\">www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donut Driveway.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/225708315\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"PRESENCE HEALING SESSIONS with Gene Ang, Ph.D.","id":"225708315","time":1449961200000,"updated":1449972989000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"9179 Red Branch Rd.","name":"Bridgeway's Nexus Center","lon":-76.822479,"id":23497753,"state":"MD","lat":39.230724,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.6038942337,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449026903000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The Mix Red &amp; Black Gala (The Mix Holiday Party)<\/b><\/p> <p>Saturday, December 12, 2015 from 6:00pm to 10:00pm<\/p> <p>The 2nd Annual Red &amp; Black Christmas Gala Red &amp; Black\u00a0<\/p> <p>semi-formal attire requested\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join us for a wonderful night of dinner, dancing, photo booth, door prizes, and fun with DMV area christian singles featuring: Music by DJ Dez Catering by Cheesecake Factory<\/p> <p>6:15pm for Appetizers<\/p> <p>7-8pm food service.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Door close at 8:00pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Early Bird Price: $28 until Dec.10 (online)\u00a0<\/p> <p>After Dec. 10, tickets $40 cash at the door\u00a0<\/p> <p>Looking forward to celebrating the holidays with you!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/secure.accessacs.com\/access\/eventlogin.aspx?id=Vp7rebJryS5MntTmVmfBIQ==&amp;site=150796&amp;ReturnUrl=events%2fwz_people.aspx&amp;ChurchID=5329&amp;EventID=99575&amp;sn=150796\">Click Here to Purchase Mix Red &amp; Black Gala Tickets<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/1\/b\/600_444627675.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Court-Me-not-Date-me\/events\/227152781\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":14400000,"name":"Red & Black Christmas Gala","id":"227152781","time":1449961200000,"updated":1449979131000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427767034000,"name":"Court Me Not Date Me","group_lon":-77.0299987793,"id":18527085,"urlname":"Court-Me-not-Date-me","group_lat":38.9700012207,"who":"Courters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"6526 Holabird Ave.","name":"Jimmy's Famous Seafood","lon":-76.534737,"id":24225511,"state":"MD","lat":39.272758,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":11,"distance":4.72292757034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448333608000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We've done two, will the third be the winner? \u00a0<i>Food and Wine<\/i> magazine says Jimmy's Famous Seafood has the best crab cake in the United States. \u00a0Hmmm...

Please note people tend to lose about 1 mph average in Patapsco as compared to Rosaryville, or Fairland. These paces are appropriate for most average riders who have good cardio endurance, but not for beginners, due to terrain and mileage. Attitude is laid-back and friendly. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections, but as it is a long ride, we will only wait as long as the last person needs to catch a breath.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but some sections may be loose and\/or soft, i.e., plan on some mud spots. There are a few steep\/long climbs, rocks and technical sections, and a stream crossing or two. A couple of sections may be a hike-a-bike for some. There are also active road sections (about 5-7 miles worth). This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places.

Please understand this will be a demanding ride. \u00a0Only about 6 miles are fairly flat, everything else is up and down. Please also note we will be climbing about 3,200 feet in elevation.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please read the directions below carefully. We do NOT meet at Peerce's.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/227022362\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"rdfpglytqbtb","time":1450218600000,"updated":1450230811000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules of this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides, is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aviationvelo.com\/\">Aviation Velo <\/a>(local bike shop in Linthicum) for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Galway Bay Irish Pub in Annapolis is a great place for happy hour, with a cozy ambience, tasty food, and an open bar area. During the holiday season, Galway Bay will also be offering its special eggnog that's imported from Ireland.

This is for all ages young and seniors!!!! All fitness levels beginner to advanced.

Followed by a brief recovery break before moving onto the next set of exercises.<\/p> <p>What Are the Benefits of this training?<\/p> <p>\u00a0The methods of\u00a0training\u00a0this way is to boost cardiovascular fitness while building strength and muscle endurance. It\u2019s perfect for people who have limited time to work out but still want to get great results. Recent studies show metabolic training builds cardiovascular fitness too. Sustained aerobic exercise isn\u2019t the only option when it comes to heart health.<\/p> <p>\u00a0These\u00a0exercises\u00a0are a fun, easy way to challenge yourself and break out of the dreaded plateau. If you\u2019ve stopped seeing gains with weight training and aerobics \u2013 or you can\u2019t burn away the excess fat,\u00a0 our workouts will shock your system so you\u2019ll start seeing results again AND\u00a0reduce boredom.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

Bah! Humbug! We all know the story from movies and plays but how many of us have actually read the book? Lets read a classic!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/7\/7\/600_444657719.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Since our discussion is held at the Nordstrom Market Cafe, I plan on enjoying dinner during our discussion. Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nEbenezer Scrooge is a miserly old man who believes that Christmas is just an excuse for people to miss work and for idle people to expect handouts. He doesn't believe in all of the good cheer and charity that the season promotes, and he makes sure everyone knows it.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThat night, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business associate, Jacob Marley -- a man who was as greedy and cold as Scrooge is. Marley warns Scrooge that if he continues to live so selfishly, he will spend eternity wearing the chains that his greed has built.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThree ghosts visit Scrooge successively: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. They show Scrooge his error in valuing money over people. Scrooge is frightened by the bleak picture of his life and promises to change his ways.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFirst published on December 19, 1843, <b>A Christmas Carol<\/b>\u00a0remains popular, having never been out of print\u00a0and has been adapted many times to film, stage, opera, and other media.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Discussion Questions<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n1. Had you read A Christmas Carol before? Did anything surprise you in the book? I was surprised by the humor. For example, this passage near the beginning:<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>[Scrooge] lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n2. This is a very short book, and not the only Christmas story that Dickens wrote. Why do you think that it and its message endured and became such a part of English-speaking culture?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n3. Did you have a favorite part? What image or line or scene sticks with you the most, if one does?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n4. How would you characterize Bob Cratchit\u2019s attitude toward Scrooge? Scrooge\u2019s attitude toward Cratchit? Besides literal heat, what might be the symbolism of the tiny coal fire that Cratchit has in the office?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n5. Why does Scrooge say that Fred should not be happy? What does this reveal about Scrooge\u2019s priorities?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n6. What is the significance or symbolism of the fact that bells announce Marley\u2019s ghost?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n7. Why is the Ghost of Christmas Past young, small, cloaked in white and shining bright? What does he mean when he says that Scrooge made his cap and has forced him to wear it?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n8. What has Marley\u2019s ghost been doing since his death?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n9. What is Scrooge\u2019s initial attitude toward the spirit?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n10. What is different about Scrooge when he says \u201cRemember it? I could walk it with a blindfold?\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n11. How does Scrooge\u2019s relationship with his sister Fan play into the story?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n12. What does the name Fezziweg suggest? When the spirit challenges Scrooge by asking if Fezziweg truly deserves such high praise for such a little party, how does Scrooge respond? How might Scrooge\u2019s claim that Fezziweg \u201chad the power to make us happy and to make us unhappy\u201d reflect upon Scrooge himself?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n13. How does Scrooge try to extinguish the light of the first spirit? Does he succeed? What is the light a symbol of?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n14. How is what Scrooge is thinking as he lies in bed waiting to see if the spirit appears different from the previous chapter? How has Scrooge\u2019s attitude toward his being escorted by a ghost changed?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n15. How is Scrooge affected by seeing the Cratchit family?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n16. What is the point of the visits with the Ghost of Christmas Present to the lighthouse and the ship?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n17. Why does Fred refuse to speak against Scrooge? How does his wife differ on this matter? Fred and his wife and Bob and his wife have different views on Scrooge. What does this say about each of them?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n18. What does the Ghost of Christmas Present mean when it says the boy and the girl under his robes, Ignorance and Want, are \u201cMan\u2019s\u201d?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n19. How does Scrooge feel about the spirit of Christmas yet to come?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n20. What is the lesson Scrooge learns when the ghost shows him the Cratchit family after Tim\u2019s death? Why is this lesson needed when Scrooge\u2019s attitude has already changed so much?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n21. Is Scrooge\u2019s transformation believable?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the back of the Nordstrom Marketplace Cafe.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/columbia-meetup-book-club\/events\/227118959\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"December Book Club Meeting","id":"227118959","time":1450395000000,"updated":1450408225000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1193699468000,"name":"Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":783965,"urlname":"columbia-meetup-book-club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hunt Valley","address_1":"Shawn Rd","name":"Greene Turtle","lon":-76.664665,"id":24256170,"state":"MD","lat":39.49501,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.3933582306,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450120379000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Adult Game Night&amp;Networking Event<\/p> <p><br\/>It Works present Adult Game Night!!!

If you've never attended a Toastmasters meeting, it is free as a guest -- bring a friend and sit back and observe, or participate if you choose. We look forward to seeing you! Note: We are having our White Elephant \/ Chinese Fortune Cookie Gift Exchange, where we exchange and discuss \"unwanted\" gifts -- it will be a blast!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bel-Air-Toastmasters-Speaking-Leadership-Group\/events\/227090065\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":5400000,"name":"Bel Air Toastmasters Meeting & Christmas\/Holiday Party Thursday, December 17th!","id":"227090065","time":1450396800000,"updated":1450403198000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1384186848000,"name":"Bel Air Toastmasters Speaking & Leadership Group","group_lon":-76.2900009155,"id":11058512,"urlname":"Bel-Air-Toastmasters-Speaking-Leadership-Group","group_lat":39.5400009155,"who":"Toastmasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hunt Valley, 21030","address_1":"118 Shawan Road HH","name":"Green Turtle","lon":-76.654358,"id":24256486,"state":"MD","lat":39.498394,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.5445337296,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450131956000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It Works present Adult Game Night!!!

Wheels rolling by 9:00. \u00a0You will notice a second ride, so we have to be wheels rolling by 9 for those of us to stand a chance to get back on time for the second ride.<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be casual, approx. 6 to 7 mph moving average. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you. It is NOT a training ride, and Racer X will be disappointed).<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Intermediate. Most trails are in great shape, but some sections may be loose and\/or soft, i.e., plan on some mud spots. There are a few steep\/long climbs, technical sections, and a stream crossing or two. There are also active road sections. This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. This video of Patapsco represents most of the area we will hit:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i0aXny9lKbg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i0aXny9lKbg<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b> Approx. 11 miles.

Please note people tend to lose about 1 mph average in Patapsco as compared to Rosaryville, or Fairland. These paces are appropriate for most average riders who have good cardio endurance, but not for beginners, due to terrain and mileage. Attitude is laid-back and friendly. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections, but as it is a long ride, we will only wait as long as the last person needs to catch a breath.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but some sections may be loose and\/or soft, i.e., plan on some mud spots. There are a few steep\/long climbs, rocks and technical sections, and a stream crossing or two. A couple of sections may be a hike-a-bike for some. There are also active road sections. This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places.

Exact route may change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, etc., but we will be on single track most of the day. Only about 2 miles of this route is paved (grist mill trail, and river road). Please understand this will be demanding. Please also note we will be climbing about 3,200 feet (close to 4,500 if you both rides) in elevation.

As mentioned, no-drop, which may add to total time. \u00a0We will also take at least one 15 minute break to refuel.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry, but we will have a chance to refill at around 10 miles, 14 miles, and 20 miles), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, food (fuel)and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). Every 10 miles or so we will be back at the park where we can refill water if need be.<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

I am posting this as an idea and encourage feedback and ideas from everyone, but I think this would be a great project! What does everyone think about making some kind of shoe box\/pillowcase or grocery bags that have necessities in them for the homeless in and around the Baltimore area? I was thinking this would be good for them around the holidays when they know someone is thinking about them. Ideas in the sacks can include socks, toiletries, bottled water, snacks, scarfs, gloves, hats, brushes\/combs and anything else that anyone can think of. I'd really like to have help on this one especially for distribution and maybe if anyone knows any restaurants or food companies or beverages that would donate a bundle of something for us to give out. Even if not donated, at least get a few people to chip in and offer something at a discounted price. Hot coffee, donuts, waters, sandwiches, chips, anything. Please offer any comments or ideas below!

Please read about the Oath Log part of the ritual, so you can think about things in advance! Finally, we could use a few things for the vigil like a coffee maker or two. If you wish to offer games, feel free to bring one!<\/p> <p>The vigil closes at dawn. Weather depending, we will all go outside to welcome the new day. Please make sure you have some clothes to handle that... even it if it just a comfy blanket!<\/p> <p>Arrive before 8:15 PM, or come after 9 PM.<\/p> <p>Yule Rite Prep 8:00 PM<\/p> <p>We will go over the ritual, which will be about 30 - 40 minutes in length, and collect our thoughts so our energies will be united in ritual.<\/p> <p>Yule Rite 8:15 PM (but possibly as late as 8:30 PM)<\/p> <p>Ritual is designed to be a complete ritual for those who are not staying for the vigil, and an opening for the vigil to those who plan on staying until the closing rite.<\/p> <p>Intention is to celebrate Yule, open a space for the vigil, as well as prepare the space for fun and merriment.<\/p> <p>We will have an Oath Log. \u00a0People may step forward in the ritual and boast about their accomplishments this past year, and make intentions for what they will accomplish this next year. This is a great time to ask for divine guidance and intervention to help manifest your desires. Please remember that this rite has Norse origins, so make intentions that you actively intend to pursue. \u00a0While it is recommended that your intentions be spoken aloud, you are welcome to state them silently if privacy is needed.<\/p> <p>You are welcome to wear ritual robes, but your stylish pajamas or festive clothes are encouraged!<\/p> <p>Yule Party 9:00 PM<\/p> <p>If you arrive late, please wait until the ritual closes and join us here. \u00a0You are welcome to stay until the closing rite in the morning even if you were not present. \u00a0We will have some yummy food and drinks, but are counting on your thoughtful contributions to really make this memorable!<\/p> <p>Candles will be lit throughout the night to measure the hours until dawn by those that are staying for the vigil.<\/p> <p>In modern times, my experience is that some people are crashed out in a puppy pile or in their sleeping bags in rooms at 2 AM, others talk or scry in the fires, and a group of people play roleplaying or board games. \u00a0I have a ton of Euro games, and if people want I can run a D&amp;D Next game for however many wish. \u00a0Do not feel limited by ideas, and if you wish use the FB group or these comments to discuss your contributions.<\/p> <p>We are a donation based group so any contribution is appreciated.\u00a0 Supplies, space, and website fees must be paid for, and your generous contributions help us grow and offer even better events in the future!\u00a0 If you're interested in finding out where the money goes please take a look at the 'Money' tab under group tools.<\/p> <p>Dawn Rite 7:15(ish) AM<\/p> <p>This rite is usually filled with giggles and mis-speaking, as some people are just too damned tired to do it right. \u00a0That is okay, the gods love mirth, and this is one of the classic rituals in which the gods laugh with you. \u00a0A new year has begun! \u00a0You spent some time this night contemplating your oaths, and here you release what holds you back and greet this new year with a strong spirit and pure intentions.<\/p> <p>Optional post Dawn Rite breakfast.<\/p> <p>Depending on the number of people, and schedules, we can arrange a community breakfast that morning. \u00a0Please discuss in the notes!<\/p> <p>Please add in the comments if you plan on staying for the vigil. \u00a0It helps us plan. \u00a0Also, I suspect several people are coffee drinkers, and while we have a number of providers nearby, we need some overnight coffee machines, so please let us know.<\/p> <p>Please also put in the comments what kind of dish you plan on bringing, so others may fill in the gaps. \u00a0Consider making something that people with food restrictions or food allergies can enjoy.<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to bring your well tended children to our Yule celebration!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Central-Maryland-Pagans\/events\/224670090\/","yes_rsvp_count":37,"name":"Yule Rite and Vigil (with a fun pajama party to boot)!","id":"drdjskytqbwb","time":1450571400000,"updated":1451191999000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1245866234000,"name":"Central Maryland Pagans","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":1479083,"urlname":"Central-Maryland-Pagans","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Pagans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"519 West Pratt Street ","name":"Greenhouse ","lon":-76.623062,"id":23962725,"state":"MD","lat":39.285923,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.326473742723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444656497000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>$10.00 suggested gift value.<\/b><\/p> <p>What is a White Elephant Gift Exchange?<br\/>White Elephant is a gift exchange game that is very similar in style to Yankee Swap, although the emphasis is to \u2018steal\u2019 gifts rather than swap them.<br\/>The game derives its name from the term white elephant as defined by something of dubious or limited value or an object no longer of value to its owner but of value to others. Thus, in its basic form the game calls for people to bring \u201cgag\u201d gifts or gifts they received that they have no use for.<\/p> <p>In a White Elephant gift exchange each participant brings a wrapped, unmarked gift and places it in a designated area. Guests are given numbers as they arrive, or their names are randomly drawn, and they select gifts in that order \u2014 with a twist.<\/p> <p>On the first turn, the person assigned with #1 picks out a gift and opens it so all can see what it is. On the second turn, the person assigned with #2 gets the choice of \u201cstealing\u201d #1\u2019s unwrapped gift or choosing a wrapped one from the pile. If #2 steals #1\u2019s gift, then #1 must choose and open a wrapped gift.<\/p> <p>As subsequent players take their turns, they either select a new gift or take any already opened gift from any of the other players. Have any player who has a gift taken away either choose a new gift or take an already-opened gift from another player.<\/p> <p>The game continues with the following rules:<\/p> <p>If someone steals your gift, you can steal someone else\u2019s gift or choose and open a wrapped one.<\/p> <p>Continue until everyone has had a turn for a gift. A turn is ended when an unopened gift has been opened.<\/p> <p>A gift can only be \u201cstolen\u201d once during a turn. If a gift is taken from someone during one round, she cannot take it back during that same round.

You are free to join us only for the Friday evening ritual, come after the ritual and stay for the party, or stay for the vigil and join us for the dawn rite!<\/p> <p><br\/>This can be a very deep rite, even though lots of silliness ensues during the night. For those who stay the night, you stand vigil on the longest night to ensure the birth of a new year. This rite goes back millennia, and staying up can put you into a bit of a trance state and connect you with some incredible ancestral energy. Most cultures had rites or vigils for the birth of a new year, and you are tapping in to that -- all while playing games and snacking!<\/p> <p>Plans are evolving quickly, but here is the tentative schedule:<\/p> <p>What to Bring<\/p> <p>Please bring a potluck dish, ideally something with some thought or care, and your warm smile.<\/p> <p>If you have a god or goddess or item you wish to celebrate and include for the altar, please bring that.<\/p> <p>The ritual is kid friendly, but we ask that children be attended to or at least well behaved. For those staying overnight, something comfy to sleep in if you wish to sleep, a pair of pajamas or comfortable clothing, and something warm to wear in case you wish to attend the outdoor Yule fire. Please read about the Oath Log part of the ritual, so you can think about things in advance! Finally, we could use a few things for the vigil like a coffee maker or two. If you wish to offer games, feel free to bring one!<\/p> <p>The vigil closes at dawn. Weather depending, we will all go outside to welcome the new day. Please make sure you have some clothes to handle that... even it if it just a comfy blanket!<\/p> <p>\n\nArrive before 8:15 PM, or come after 9 PM.<\/p> <p>Yule Rite Prep 8:00 PM<\/p> <p>We will go over the ritual, which will be about 30 - 40 minutes in length, and collect our thoughts so our energies will be united in ritual.<\/p> <p>Yule Rite 8:15 PM (but possibly as late as 8:30 PM)<\/p> <p>Ritual is designed to be a complete ritual for those who are not staying for the vigil, and an opening for the vigil to those who plan on staying until the closing rite.<\/p> <p>Intention is to celebrate Yule, open a space for the vigil, as well as prepare the space for fun and merriment.<\/p> <p>We will have an Oath Log. People may step forward in the ritual and boast about their accomplishments this past year, and make intentions for what they will accomplish this next year. This is a great time to ask for divine guidance and intervention to help manifest your desires. Please remember that this rite has Norse origins, so make intentions that you actively intend to pursue. While it is recommended that your intentions be spoken aloud, you are welcome to state them silently if privacy is needed.<\/p> <p>You are welcome to wear ritual robes, but your stylish pajamas or festive clothes are encouraged!<\/p> <p>Yule Party 9:00 PM<\/p> <p>If you arrive late, please wait until the ritual closes and join us here. You are welcome to stay until the closing rite in the morning even if you were not present. We will have some yummy food and drinks, but are counting on your thoughtful contributions to really make this memorable!<\/p> <p>Candles will be lit throughout the night to measure the hours until dawn by those that are staying for the vigil.<\/p> <p>In modern times, my experience is that some people are crashed out in a puppy pile or in their sleeping bags in rooms at 2 AM, others talk or scry in the fires, and a group of people play roleplaying or board games. I have a ton of Euro games, and if people want I can run a D&amp;D Next game for however many wish. Do not feel limited by ideas, and if you wish use the FB group or these comments to discuss your contributions.<\/p> <p>We are a donation based group so any contribution is appreciated. Supplies, space, and website fees must be paid for, and your generous contributions help us grow and offer even better events in the future! If you're interested in finding out where the money goes please take a look at the 'Money' tab under group tools.<\/p> <p>Dawn Rite 7:15(ish) AM<\/p> <p>This rite is usually filled with giggles and mis-speaking, as some people are just too damned tired to do it right. That is okay, the gods love mirth, and this is one of the classic rituals in which the gods laugh with you. A new year has begun! You spent some time this night contemplating your oaths, and here you release what holds you back and greet this new year with a strong spirit and pure intentions.<\/p> <p>Optional post Dawn Rite breakfast.<\/p> <p>Depending on the number of people, and schedules, we can arrange a community breakfast that morning. Please discuss in the notes!<\/p> <p>Please add in the comments if you plan on staying for the vigil. It helps us plan. Also, I suspect several people are coffee drinkers, and while we have a number of providers nearby, we need some overnight coffee machines, so please let us know.<\/p> <p>Please also put in the comments what kind of dish you plan on bringing, so others may fill in the gaps. Consider making something that people with food restrictions or food allergies can enjoy.<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to bring your well tended children to our Yule celebration!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wyrd-Weavers\/events\/227355494\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":43200000,"name":"Yule Rite and Vigil (with a fun pajama party to boot)!","id":"227355494","time":1450573200000,"updated":1450617233000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1358298988000,"name":"Wyrd Weavers","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":6682212,"urlname":"Wyrd-Weavers","group_lat":39,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Timonium ","address_1":"63 E.

So many things finally came together, including McCarthey taking over the play calling again! Whoop!<\/p> <p>With just three weeks remaining until the end of the regular season, the Green Bay Packers and Oakland Raiders find themselves in familiar positions ahead of their Week 15 matchup. Green Bay is on the verge of making the playoffs once again, and Oakland is close to officially missing the postseason for the 13th consecutive year.<\/p> <p>The Packers are one win away from clinching a playoff berth. The Raiders can\u2019t win the AFC West, and trail three potential wild-card teams by two games, but they are still fighting, having defeated\u00a0the Denver Broncos in Week 14 to claim their sixth win of the year.<\/p> <p>On the Raider's defense, Khalil Mack is putting up huge\u00a0numbers. Mack was the Raiders\u00a0most important player last week, leading the team with five sacks. The Packers offensive line will need to play tough this week and protect Rodgers, who has spent too much time lately getting knocked around.<\/p> <p>Green Bay can clinch a playoff berth with:<br\/>1) GB win or tie<br\/>2) TB loss or tie + WAS loss or tie<br\/>3) TB loss or tie + NYG loss or tie<\/p> <p>The game will be televised locally, but don't let that stop you from coming out to Perry's Restaurant and celebrating a Packers' win and clinching a playoff berth with the Maryland Cheeseheads!

Watermark is running evening 45-minute cruises on weekends during December. These\u00a0\"Jolly Express\" trips\u00a0let people get out on the water to enjoy the scenic lights along Spa Creek, and are another good reason to celebrate the holiday cheer of Christmas season in historic Annapolis. I've purchased tickets for the 7:00 pm cruise, and also plan to do some nice eating and drinking somewhere while I'm downtown.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The boat only carries 23 people at one time, so buy your tickets early if you want to be on this particular cruise. Here is the description from the Watermark website:<\/p> <p><i>Annapolis' favorite holiday activity makes its return for the 2015 \u00a0holiday season. We adorn Miss Anne\u00a0in reindeer spirit and our crew serves up hot cocoa to all our jolly passengers. Captain Santa is at the helm during this cozy evening cruise of Spa Creek. Enjoy holiday music while Santa takes you on a relaxing and enjoyable boat ride. Cozy blankets are available on board.\u00a0The Jolly Express is a classic Annapolis holiday activity and a perfect opportunity to start a family holiday tradition. 45-minute cruise. In the spirit of the season, a portion of proceeds will be donated to Historic Annapolis.<\/i><\/p> <p>Full details and tickets can be purchased here:<\/p> <p>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/special-cruises\/jolly-express\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/special-cruises\/jolly-express\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/cruisesonthebay.com\/special-cruises\/jolly-express\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the Watermark tour boarding gate","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People\/events\/227111548\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Watermark Christmas Lights Cruise on Spa Creek","id":"227111548","time":1450655100000,"updated":1450736511000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326056943000,"name":"Second Half Rally - Active FUN!","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":3068792,"urlname":"Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People","group_lat":39,"who":"Fun People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21218","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","phone":"410.243.7200","address_1":"3501 St Paul St","name":"Baltimore Shambhala Center","lon":-76.615879,"id":705394,"state":"MD","lat":39.330356,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.80275797844,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424377274000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For the most up-to-date details, check out our Facebook page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/374447366038104\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/374447366038104\/<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>A time to practice mindfulness in our social interactions!

But sorting through the pile of so-called 9\/11 novels is a sad exercise, one that grows more pointless by the day. They\u2019re all 9\/11 novels now.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s impossible, though, to stop scanning the horizon for something else \u2014 the bracing, wide-screen, many-angled novel that will leave a larger, more definitive intellectual and moral footprint on the new age of terror.<\/p> <p>Joseph O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cNetherland\u201d is not that novel. It\u2019s too urbane, too small-boned, too savvy to carry much Dreiserian sweep and swagger. But here\u2019s what \u201cNetherland\u201d surely is: the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we\u2019ve yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Center fell. On a micro level, it\u2019s about a couple and their young son living in Lower Manhattan when the planes hit, and about the event\u2019s rippling emotional aftermath in their lives. On a macro level, it\u2019s about nearly everything: family, politics, identity. I devoured it in three thirsty gulps, gulps that satisfied a craving I didn\u2019t know I had.<\/p> <p>O\u2019Neill, who was born in Ireland, raised in Holland and now lives in New York, seems incapable of composing a boring sentence or thinking an uninteresting thought, whether he\u2019s writing about dating (\u201cWe courted in the style preferred by the English: alcoholically\u201d) or the darker stuff that keeps us awake at night, like the nuclear plant just up the river (\u201cIndian Point: the earliest, most incurable apprehensions stirred in its very name\u201d).<\/p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s prose glows with what <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/k\/alfred_kazin\/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Alfred Kazin<\/a> called \u201cthe marginal suggestiveness which in a great writer always indicates those unspoken reserves, that silent assessment of life, that can be heard below and beyond the slow marshaling of thought.\u201d And O\u2019Neill knows how to deploy the quotidian fripperies of our laptop culture to devastating fictional effect. There\u2019s a moment in \u201cNetherland\u201d involving a father, the son who has been taken from him, and Google Earth that\u2019s among the most moving set pieces I\u2019ve read in a recent novel. The father hovers over his son\u2019s house nightly, \u201cflying on Google\u2019s satellite function,\u201d lingering over his child\u2019s dormer window and blue inflated swimming pool, searching the \u201cdepthless\u201d pixels for anything, from thousands of miles away, he can cling to. O\u2019Neill\u2019s novel is full of moments like this: closely observed, emotionally racking, un-self-consciously in touch with how we live now.<\/p> <p>The plot in \u201cNetherland\u201d runs on two tracks. The first tells the story of a family. The narrator, Hans van den Broek, is a Dutch-born equities analyst (he compares himself, in terms of influence if not infamy, to <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/b\/henry_blodget\/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Henry Blodget<\/a>) who lives in a TriBeCa loft with his British-born wife, Rachel, and their son. When 9\/11 forces them to flee farther uptown, they end up living, almost by accident, in the shabby-glamorous Chelsea Hotel, and it is there that their marriage slowly cracks apart.<\/p> <p>Rachel wants to take their son back to London and her family. He\u2019ll be safer there, far from George Bush and the United States, a country she has begun to think of as \u201cideologically diseased.\u201d Hans, unsure of his feelings, starts to believe he is \u201ca political-ethical idiot.\u201d O\u2019Neill writes beautifully about what it sometimes felt like in the months after 9\/11, when you couldn\u2019t attend a dinner party unless you were intellectually armed for hours of bitter debate: \u201cFor those under the age of 45 it seemed that world events had finally contrived a meaningful test of their capacity for conscientious political thought. Many of my acquaintances, I realized, had passed the last decade or two in a state of intellectual and psychic yearning for such a moment \u2014 or, if they hadn\u2019t, were able to quickly assemble an expert arguer\u2019s arsenal of thrusts and statistics and ripostes and gambits and examples and salient facts and rhetorical maneuvers. I, however, was almost completely caught out.\u201d<\/p> <p>What Hans and Rachel are trying to avoid, he tells us, is \u201cwhat might be termed a historic mistake. We were trying to understand, that is, whether we were in a preapocalyptic situation, like the European Jews in the \u201930s or the last citizens of Pompeii, or whether our situation was merely near-apocalyptic, like that of the cold war inhabitants of New York, London, Washington and, for that matter, Moscow.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter. Rachel and their son are soon gone, while Hans stays behind in New York.<\/p> <p>The book\u2019s second story line, and perhaps its more resonant one, is about the solace Hans finds in the vibrant subculture of cricket in New York, where he is among the few white men to be found on the hundreds of largely West Indian teams in the city, teams that fan out, in the hazy summertime, across scrabby, lesser-known public parks.<\/p> <p>O\u2019Neill seems to know all there is to know about this sport. He writes about it with casual grace, describing, for example, the cricket batsman\u2019s array of potential strokes: \u201cthe glance, the hook, the cut, the sweep, the cover drive, the pull and all those other offspring of technique conceived to send the cricket ball rolling and rolling, as if by magic, to the far-off edge of the playing field.\u201d<\/p> <p>The cricket these men play is, they realize, not quite the game they fell in love with back in the Antilles. The New York fields are too small, and not well tended. Here is more of O\u2019Neill\u2019s lovely writing about the game: \u201cThis degenerate version of the sport \u2014 bush cricket, as Chuck more than once dismissed it \u2014 inflicts an injury that is aesthetic as much as anything: the American adaptation is devoid of the beauty of cricket played on a lawn of appropriate dimensions, where the white-clad ring of infielders, swanning figures on the vast oval, again and again converge in unison toward the batsman and again and again scatter back to their starting points, a repetition of pulmonary rhythm, as if the field breathed through its luminous visitors.\u201d<\/p> <p>O\u2019Neill cracks open a teeming world on the fringes of Manhattan, and through it we witness the aspirations of countless men who otherwise are invisible to wealthy Manhattanites. (\u201cYou want a taste of how it feels to be a black man in this country?\u201d one character asks. \u201cPut on the white clothes of the cricketer. Put on white to feel black.\u201d)<\/p> <p>Hans\u2019s guide through this alternative city is Chuck Ramkissoon, a talky, street-smart Trinidadian who is alive in ways Hans is not. Some of Chuck\u2019s business practices are shady (he runs an old-world \u201cweh weh\u201d gambling ring and intimidates his rivals), but he\u2019s a Gatsby-like American dreamer as well, a man who hopes to build a world-class cricket arena in Brooklyn.<\/p> <p>Chuck wants to make a killing on his cricket center, but he also has bigger ambitions: he essentially wants to save the world. \u201cAll people, Americans, whoever, are at their most civilized when they\u2019re playing cricket,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing that happens when Pakistan and India make peace? They play a cricket match. Cricket is instructive, Hans. It has a moral angle. ... I say, we want to have something in common with Hindus and Muslims? Chuck Ramkissoon is going to make it happen. With the New York Cricket Club, we could start a whole new chapter in U.S. history. Why not?\u201d<\/p> <p>Some of the best parts of \u201cNetherland\u201d are Chuck\u2019s rambling political and cultural monologues, delivered as Hans drives him around the boroughs. (Ostensibly, Chuck is helping Hans prepare for his driving test. Unwittingly, Hans is Chuck\u2019s chauffeur, shuttling him to some of his least tasteful business dealings.) The book\u2019s few lesser moments occur at the Chelsea Hotel, where a cast of eccentrics \u2014 including a man who wears angel\u2019s wings and a wedding dress \u2014 are asked to carry cheap metaphorical freight.<\/p> <p>Chuck\u2019s vast cricket plans don\u2019t pan out, and he vanishes under murky and ultimately grisly circumstances. Did he kill himself? one friend asks. Another responds: \u201cYou idiot! Chuck isn\u2019t a suicide guy! This guy has more life inside him than 10 people!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cNetherland\u201d is a bit like the wily and ebullient Chuck Ramkissoon. It has more life inside it than 10 very good novels.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Federal-Hill-Book-Wine-Club\/events\/226867983\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Mid-December Meetup- Netherland by Joseph O'Neill","id":"226867983","time":1450656000000,"updated":1450668280000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1296760489000,"name":"Federal Hill Book & Wine Club","group_lon":-76.6299972534,"id":1777768,"urlname":"Federal-Hill-Book-Wine-Club","group_lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Mount Airy","address_1":"102 S Main Street, Lower Level","name":"Mt Airy Arts Alliance Gallery","lon":-76.701248,"id":24043464,"state":"MD","lat":38.952724,"repinned":false},"headcount":4,"distance":23.75548172,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442942293000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a small circle of friends who welcome others to join in a relaxing and stimulating evening of drumming.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the window with white Christmas lights (not Pottery Barn).

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

The report does\u00a0notinclude detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants. For in-depth learning through classes or workshops on foraging, processing, cooking, or medicine making with wild plants, please visit Charm City Farm's other programming.<\/p> <p>The report runs March 18- Dec 16, for a total of 40 issues. Subscribers can join at any time throughout the year. Subscription is $10 per email address.<\/p> <p>The Charm City Farms Forage Report is authored by Victoria Greba, a Baltimore based nature instructor specializing in the use of wild plants.<\/p> <p>To view a sample report and to subscribe please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcityfarms.org\/foragers-of-baltimore\/subscribe-to-charm-city-farms-forage-report\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/0\/0\/event_435870720.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a weekly email subscription.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Charm-City-Farms\/events\/226885742\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"The Forage Report","id":"kldhglytqbfc","time":1450886400000,"updated":1450898791000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1371868523000,"name":"Charm City Farms","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":9036002,"urlname":"Charm-City-Farms","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Friendly earth people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":15.3214464188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1268852545000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet once a week with other local beadwork artists to work on and discuss new beading techniques.

They sing carols and Polish songs with gusto while waving at the local residents who live there. Along the way, people are invited inside to visit a Polish Catholic church where the priest welcomes the crowd. Very festive and lots of fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>The parade starts at 7:00 pm.

I have gone for the past 3 years and it is a blast. About 800 people joined the parade last year. Carolers essentially do a lap around Fells Point proper, led by a full blown Polka band while singing traditional carols in English and Polish, with phonetic pronunciation available for the 99.99% of us that no longer know any other languages other than high school Spanish \u2013 thanks public school!\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Most of the streets around the route are blocked off momentarily by police for the throngs to pass through, so carolers can revel in the knowledge that they\u2019re probably pissing off some Harbor East resident who\u2019s attempting to get home by way of Canton, so that\u2019s pretty satisfying. Also in the satisfying department, a lot of Fells Point is shockingly still inhabited by people who legitimately decorate their houses and apartments; legitimate citizens of Baltimore who\u2019ve been here long enough to remember when the Polish Home Club probably had over a handful of members, they sit by their windows and populate their stoops, actually waving to people as they stroll by singing off-key, occasionally even handing out a cookie or three. It\u2019s down right heart warming. The sing-walkathon ends with an after party at the Home Club itself, featuring even more Polka and cheap as hell booze.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Speaking of booze, the aforementioned \u201cNot all boring\u201d aspect of this whole caroling experience: Lots of booze. Lots of Medovukha\/Krupnikas, lots of Vodka, lots and lots of hot, boozy cider to warm your throat and loosen your vocal cords enough to let yourself hear yourself sing poorly. Even if someone hands you a cup of hot cocoa and swears it contains no alcohol, *do not bring it near an open flame*. So at the very least, a fun boozy time with friends and Polka in the middle of the street should be enough to get you there.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/7\/7\/600_443544951.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet in front of the Polish Home Club or earlier at Max's Taproom at 5:30 pm","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People\/events\/223811129\/","yes_rsvp_count":36,"name":"Polish Christmas Caroling Parade in Fells Point","id":"223811129","time":1450914300000,"updated":1450995638000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326056943000,"name":"Second Half Rally - Active FUN!","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":3068792,"urlname":"Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People","group_lat":39,"who":"Fun People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Bel Air","address_1":"17 N Main Street","name":"Collector's Corner","lon":-76.349777,"id":23682023,"state":"MD","lat":39.537163,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":11,"distance":22.3997421265,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443055461000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dare to descend into the Underdark in this adventure for the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game!

Waters pokes fun at the holiday season with adult-appropriate humor, effectively \"putting the X in Xmas,\" developing a show for the open minded and slightly left-of-center audience. The cult classic, Baltimore-born filmmaker began his Hollywood success with now Broadway classic, Hairspray in 1988. Claiming his playful nicknames \"Pope of Trash\" and \"Prince of Puke,\" he maintains his image through his film-making and his personal presentation. Regarded as a shocking entertainer, John Waters carefully chooses his material and exploits it through a dirty lens. \"It's my obsession with Christmas: what I want for Christmas, what you should want, how to handle every holiday disaster,\" Waters says. His rapid-fire monologue explores and explodes the traditional holiday rituals and traditions as he shares his religious fanaticism for Santa Claus, and an unhealthy love of real life holiday horror stories. Delving into his passion for lunatic exploitation Christmas movies and the unhealthy urge to remake all his own films into seasonal children's classics, \"The Pope of Trash\" will give you a Joyeaux Noel like no other.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/PTbalto-org\/events\/227232656\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"A John Waters' Christmas: Holier & Dirtier","id":"227232656","time":1450918800000,"updated":1451149616000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1426701473000,"name":"Prime Timers a social, support group of older gay men","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18510087,"urlname":"PTbalto-org","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Prime Timers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21045","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"9130F Red Branch Road","name":"Optimum Performance Training Institute","lon":-76.818268,"id":2345101,"state":"MD","lat":39.232128,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":11,"headcount":0,"distance":11.358464241,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1351562178000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Group Kettlebell Training is a comprehensive one hour class that includes mobility and flexibility, core stability, strength, power and conditioning.
