Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

The challenge is especially prominent for biologics which are increasingly dominating the therapeutic landscape. Current methods of drug delivery have several limitations including the use of needle-based injections in case of biologics and lack of targeting in case of small molecules. Mitragotri's laboratory is developing novel methods to directly address these challenges. They have developed transdermal and oral delivery methods that offer a painless and needle-free alternative to injection-based methods for delivering drugs such as insulin and vaccines. Mitragotri's laboratory has also developed novel strategies for targeted drug delivery using nanoparticle-based systems. Nanoparticles are widely explored to improve the therapeutic outcome of small molecules. However, poor vascular circulation, limited targeting and the inability to negotiate biological barriers have prevented the overwhelming majority of nanoparticles from entering the clinic. Mother Nature has provided us with many examples of successful \u2018particles\u2019 of her own in the form of viruses, bacteria and circulatory cells. They have developed biologically-inspired and bio-mimetic nanoparticle systems to target drugs to the diseased site. Mitragorti will provide an overview of these systems with respect to their principles and capabilities.<\/p> <p>Host:<br\/>Ali Khademhosseini, MASc, Ph.D.<br\/>Associate Faculty member, Wyss Institute for<br\/>Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University<br\/>Professor at Harvard-MIT's<br\/>Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST),<br\/>Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonBiotech\/events\/225369021\/","yes_rsvp_count":37,"name":"Bioinspired, Bioengineered and Biomimetic Systems for Drug Delivery","id":"225369021","time":1443124800000,"updated":1443211115000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1097368029000,"name":"Boston Biotech","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":178843,"urlname":"BostonBiotech","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Biotechnology Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02210","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"35 Thomson Place","address_2":"Cafe (1st floor)","name":"Zipcar Home Office","lon":-71.04701,"id":24079355,"state":"MA","lat":42.35129,"repinned":false},"headcount":9,"distance":1.3214610815,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441938400000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Folks liked the Lean Coffee format after the first MeetUp, asking for another round.

There's absolutely no need to book your plane tickets to NYC, as this Tony Award-winning musical sensation is heading your way....<\/p> <p>From the four-time Emmy Award-winning creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, comes this outrageous comedy musical about a pair of mismatched Mormon inductees who are sent on a mission to a place that's about as far from Salt Lake City as you can get.The musical was written in collaboration with Robert Lopez, the Tony Award-winning writer of Avenue Q, and co-directed by Mr. Parker and three-time Tony nominee Casey Nicholaw (Spamalot, The Drowsy Chaperone).<\/p> <p>With a roof-lifting 19 original songs that range from filthy, to obscene, to sweet and full of heart, this is sure to win over everybody (although perhaps don't bring your local pastor).<\/p> <p>WHAT IS THE BOOK OF MORMON ABOUT?<\/p> <p>'The greatest time of a Mormon kid's life is his mission,' sings Elder Kevin Price before finding out where and who with, his journey starts. But things are not as the handsome and pious Elder Price predicted, when he's paired up with the hapless and roly-poly Elder Cunningham and sent to...UGANDA! Disneyland, this isn't.<\/p> <p>The adventure unfolds as Elder Price and Elder Cunningham try to preach \"The Book\" to a local community destroyed by disease and ruled by an evil war lord. Meanwhile the disaster-prone duo learn about themselves, the true meaning of friendship and what their religion ultimately means to them. Get your tickets for the hottest show in town, and the most outrageous!<\/p> <p>DID YOU KNOW?<\/p> <p>Instead of picketing Broadway or theaters nationwide as originally feared, The Mormon church has taken the good-natured and risque lampooning of The Book Of Mormon with a wry grin and have instead taken out advertisements in the show's playbills across the world, under the heading 'The book is always better'. Now that is what we call a darned good sport!<\/p> <p>- See more at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boston-theater.com\/theaters\/colonial-theater\/the-book-of-mormon.php#sthash.z3ftAhFb.dpuf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.boston-theater.com\/theaters\/colonial-theater\/the-book-of-mormon.php#sthash.z3ftAhFb.dpuf<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/metrowestyoungprofessionals\/events\/225092579\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Book Of Mormon","id":"225092579","time":1443135600000,"updated":1443147761000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1200371276000,"name":"Metro West Young Professionals Group","group_lon":-71.4199981689,"id":951974,"urlname":"metrowestyoungprofessionals","group_lat":42.2700004578,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"2 South Market St, 3rd Floor","name":"Bocoup","lon":-71.055687,"id":23500749,"state":"MA","lat":42.359779,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":140,"headcount":0,"distance":0.732209742069,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441133962000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"donation","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Like sands through the hourglass, this is the week of BostonJS.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We know we would really benefit from your help and feedback, and we think this will be fun!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's the ask: We need about 5-10 minutes of your time each day for nine days, starting on\u00a0Friday, September 25th. Essentially we'll be playing a virtual simulation game. You'll be given some imaginary money to play with and we'll ask you to make decisions about how you'd like to allocate that imaginary money and your time to solve social problems. Every day during those weeks you'll be asked to take a simple action (e.g., rate an idea, raise some questions) toward this end.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This shouldn't make total sense to you at this point (we can't give too much away in advance) but we think it will be easy and enjoyable.

Now this beloved author digs deep into her own generative process to share her wisdom and unique perspective about creativity. With profound empathy and radiant generosity, she offers potent insights into the mysterious nature of inspiration. She asks us to embrace our curiosity and let go of needless suffering.

Questions unspoken are answered by Spirit, further confirming the information and verifying the support and connections you have from the other side.<\/p> <p><br\/>Kristi Johnston is guided by Spirit to draw images of loved ones who have passed, angel guides or totem animals. She draws these upside down, contrary to her normal drawing method. These images bring further confirmation that our time here on earth is not all there is, and the unseen world is real and accessible. \u00a0The sketch is gifted to the person for whom it was drawn.<\/p> <p><br\/>The connection of these three women to each other and to Spirit provides a completely unique experience for all those in attendance.

He kindly led a portrait workshop for us. I was blown away by this guys knowledge and teaching skill. I have spent thousands of dollars to hear and see the 'best in the business' but I found Ian to be by far the best I have ever seen. His patience, humor, and willingness to give up his knowledge is unique and extremely refreshing. I wish I had discovered him years ago. He taught us more in two hours than I have gained in days from other teachers and he made it all so easy. I will definitely be spending more time at Ian's classes and I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about learning photographic skills. Ian is certainly the best photography teacher in New England and I susoect he ranks in the top five in the USA. He should be charging ten times what he currently charges - and if he did it would still be great value! I urge you to join this group and attend his workshops.\u00a0\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photoworks\/members\/77750532\/\">Robert Reed<\/a> on Jan 24, 2013.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201c\u00a0This was a great workshop!

Leaving her fianc\u00e9 F\u00e9lix ashore, she joins the crew of an old cargo ship, the Fidelio, as a mechanic.

Lulled by life aboard the ship and entranced by the limitless horizon of the wide-open ocean, Alice succumbs to desire and begins an affair with Ga\u00ebl.

It has a shedload of top-roping routes ranging from a set of friendly-looking 5.6s in little railroad, to some pretty burly looking routes in the 5.11 range on the overhanging Q-wall. There is even a single, solitary, route than can be led.<br\/>Other popular activities in the quarry include graffiti, drinking, smoking weed, and disposing of bodies.<\/p> <p><br\/>You can very conceivably get there by public transport from Boston: take the red line to Quincy center and then the 215 bus. If anyone has a car, however, the journey will be much simpler. Car pooling would be much appreciated, I'm sure.<\/p> <p><br\/>I'd suggest we meet under Q-wall in the main quarry at about 11:30am - if you're coming from the car park it's the first one you come to, on the right as you enter.<\/p> <p><br\/>Good topos are available on mountain project along with an aerial map of the quarry so you can orient yourselves: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountainproject.com\/v\/quincy-quarries\/105908121\"><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountainproject.com\/v\/quincy-quarries\/105908121\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mountainproject.com\/v\/quincy-quarries\/105908121<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n==Gear: [ please read carefully ]==<\/p> <p><br\/>Most routes have expansion bolts above them for setting up a top-rope. A decent rack for Quincy will involve about 8-10m of rigging rope or thick tape, a handful of locking carabiners (min 4 per anchor), and a 50m rope or longer. The rock is pretty stable, but a helmet would be a smart move.<br\/>Obviously the number of people who can go at any time is limited by the number of ropes etc, so please make it known in the comments if you have a rope to offer, or rigging gear, or will be relying on other people. I'm sure we're happy to share, but it would be wise not to turn up and expect to climb all day just using other people's equipment, especially if ropes are limited.

Much more than shouting \u201cEn Garde!\u201d and assuming a guard stance; competent warriors fought with systems that included various ways to attack and defend, footwork, timing, and even rules of dueling, all based on a sophisticated understanding of body mechanics, mathematics and philosophy.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/9\/d\/600_440793949.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The 16th century was a period of change for the sword. No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society. Blades slimmed and guards became more elaborate as the sword evolved into a nimble thrusting weapon worn by commoner and noble alike. As a result, a number of fencing schools opened to capitalize on their growing popularity. The golden age of rapier study dawned around 1550; numerous masters publishing fencing system manuals over the century to follow, with topics including rapier, off-hand companions such as the dagger, buckler and cape, long sword, quarterstaff, pole arm, dagger alone, and grappling.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/e\/600_440793934.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our six-week Novice Rapier course will introduce the basic techniques and vocabulary of rapier fencing, enabling students to begin their study of period combat and the Art of Defence.

When results on other levels were reported, it soon became evident much more was at work. Let me share our exciting discovery on how this process directly countermands the stress response, instantly unifying and balancing energy between brain hemispheres while creating a novel state of mind - 'eyes open waking alpha'. Here, the person withdraws from deep limbic function and away from their egocentric self toward their 'higher self'. With clear seeing the individual is liberated from a sense of struggle while gaining access to their body's own self healing program.

We will be meeting shortly before they open so we can be the first ones on the golf course and enjoy ourselves.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe'll meet and check-in @ 10:30am and do introductions as we form groups based on who likes to follow the rules, who likes to bend the rules, and who likes to be footloose and fancy-free. \u00a0We'll mostly be interacting with our group members and those immediately in front of or behind us. \u00a0As each group finishes we'll enjoy some ice cream and do some more introductions and get to know each other a little more. \u00a0Afterwards, if anyone is interested, we can grab a bite to eat, either breakfast or lunch; there are a couple of options in walking distance very close by.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis is a multi-group event as listed below. \u00a0Please do not double or triple RSVP. \u00a0It may co$t ya.<\/p> <p>Social Fun:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socialfun\">www.meetup.com\/socialfun<\/a><\/p> <p>South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ssdomg\">www.meetup.com\/ssdomg<\/a><\/p> <p>South Shore Hike Bike &amp; Social Club:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socialnetwork-1414\">www.meetup.com\/socialnetwork-1414<\/a><\/p> <p>South of Boston, Norwood Singles Social Events\/Dating Meetup:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Norwood-Singles-Social-Events-and-Dating-Meetup\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Norwood-Singles-Social-Events-and-Dating-Meetup\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Norwood-Singles-Social-Events-and-Dating-Meetup\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe are asking each group to have a co-host to help with attendance (for your particular group), and with getting groups organized and keeping the peace. \u00a0(We don't want to be a bad example to the kids who may be golfing behind us, do we.*wink*) \u00a0Groups without a co-host will be limited to 6 participants, including the Host.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPlease keep an open mind and be open to meeting singles who might be interested in dating you or who may know someone who may be interested in dating you! \u00a0Given the various age groups of the different meetup groups please consider joining us if you are not near retirement age. \u00a0(Suggested age range for this event is 21-59. \u00a0There will be other all-ages singles events in the future as I will mix them up.)<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p><b>Date-Able Singles Mini Golf\u00a0<br\/>Sunday, September 27th @ 10:30am -1pm<br\/>Pine Meadows Mini Golf\u00a0<\/b><br\/>Main Street\u00a0<br\/>Route 18\u00a0<br\/>Next to Jiffy Lube (1419 Main Street)\u00a0<br\/>South Weymouth\u00a0<br\/>(No phone on-site.)<\/p> <p>Meeting Location: Please meet along the fence near the building in the parking lot side. \u00a0We are expecting over 2 dozen people so please be mindful of everyone's safety.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nOrganizer(s): Angela &amp; TBD \/ Each Group needs an Event Co-Host who will be in charge of Attendance for their Group.<\/p> <p>Min\/Max: We are requesting at least 10 Yes RSVPs among all groups (excluding the Host) at least one week prior to the event. \u00a0Each group will start with a max of 6 which will be increased to 10 once we have an Event Co-Host in place and a WaitList. \u00a0The maximum total for this event is 40 people between all groups and I will adjust the max in each group accordingly 4-5 days prior to the event. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Guests: None at this time.<\/p> <p>Cost: $6 for 18 holes of mini golf and ice cream<\/p> <p>Fee: Since this is an event for multiple meetup groups and they all have different policies for fees and such, there will be no fees for today's event. \u00a0However, if you belong to a group that does have fees or voluntary donations I will gladly accept it and pass it along.<\/p> <p>Cash Only Policy: Please adhere to our Group's cash only policy.

If it is rainy when I get up I will call the owner to check to make sure we are still on. If this event is cancelled I will do my best to email the Yes RSVPs by 9:30am on Sunday. Plan to mini golf though because the rain is supposed to fall in the early morning hours. We are the first ones on the course and by meeting at 10:30 we can check everyone in and get groups figured out so we can have fun mini golfing.**<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Directions: Please use mapquest.com for door-to-door directions.<\/p> <p>Overview: Located on Route 18 just north of the intersection of Route 58 w\/ Factory Paint on the corner.

Different spiritual traditions teach methods of \"awakening\" kundalini for the purpose of reaching spiritual enlightenment. The Yoga Upanishads describe Kundalini as lying \"coiled\" at the base of the spine, represented as either a goddess or sleeping serpent waiting to be awakened. In modern commentaries, Kundalini has been called an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force, or \"mother energy or intelligence of complete maturation\".<\/p> <p>Kundalini awakening is said to result in deep meditation, enlightenment and bliss. This awakening involves the Kundalini physically moving up the central channel to reach within the Crown Chakra at the top of the head. Many systems focus on the awakening of Kundalini through meditation, pranayama breathing, and the practice of asana and chanting of mantras.

Nick\u2019s work is being supervised by Dr. Erik Gregory, the psychologist-in-residence at the Humanist Hub and by a volunteer team of top scholars at Harvard and beyond in developmental moral psychology and related topics. Here is what Nick and the team have come up with so far:<\/p> <p>Children have incredible minds: exploratory, inventive, and compassionate minds. There is an inquisitive spirit in young people that (if your childhood was anything like ours) often runs into various obstacles along the way of growing up. There are a thousand and one ways children are told the meaning of their lives instead of being encouraged to make their own. Why is it we aren\u2019t taught critical thinking skills in school? Why don\u2019t we learn what a compassionate exchange of ideas looks like from a young age?<\/p> <p>This year we will build a program that does just that. We want to empower the child to ask her own big questions, and offer her a toolkit to try and answer them. We want to tell kids less of what to think, and explore more how to think.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be putting together interesting prompts every month to explore topics from personal identity, community, all the way to the biosphere and the cosmos, and we\u2019re going to encourage the kids to explore these topics in their own creative way, developing an expressive ritual that brings an incentive to their own internal process. As they do we want to emphasize critical thinking skills, compassion, and finding their own joy in learning.<\/p> <p>We\u2019re very excited our first one hour session, this Sunday September 27th from noon to 1pm, where anyone interested can stop by and participate without commitment. It will be a really fun session and afterwards, those who wish can have their children stay for an additional session from 1:30 to 3:00, while parents can stay for our very popular Sunday Speak Series.

It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to toprope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. This meetup assures you'll meet a partner to climb with.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time? Just let everyone know you want to climb at a different time and use the community to find a partner for those dates \/ times.<\/p> <p>These are the climbing rates:<\/p> <p>ADMISSION (Full day use, you can leave and come back!): Day Pass - $25 (Students $18)<br\/>10 Pack - $200 (Students $169)<\/p> <p>RENTALS: Shoes - $5<br\/>Harness - $5<br\/>Chalk Bag - $2<br\/>Full Gear Kit - $11<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/225134927\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Brooklyn Boulders Somerville Sunday","id":"rtlbklytmbkc","time":1443369600000,"updated":1443383689000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":13,"distance":2.06740999222,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442697709000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Red Sox Natives, Organizers\u00a0and friends Game Viewing Patriots vs Jaguars at\u00a0private residence\u00a0after 12 Noon.<\/p> <p>Game available on two screens.<\/p> <p>Indoors or\u00a0Out door grounds with Red Sox Corn Hole.<\/p> <p>Appetizers and Pizza will be provided.<\/p> <p>BBQ Grille On - bring anything you want to cook and or cook and share.<\/p> <p>Bring\u00a0anything you want to drink and or share.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join\u00a0Red Sox Natives Founder Jon, Organizers and close friends at Jon's home in sprawling Dunstable.<\/p> <p>Address will be provided on Friday to those who RSVP.<\/p> <p>Game Time 1:00pm\u00a0thru 4:00pm<\/p> <p>See you on Sunday , September 27!<\/p> <p>Go Pats!\u00a0<\/p> <p>From The Red Sox Natives Team<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP by Friday evening\u00a0to facilitate food preparation order\u00a0and do not share this invite with the random public.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/natives\/events\/225474125\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Patriots vs Jaguars Game Viewing for Red Sox Natives Organizers and Members","id":"225474125","time":1443370500000,"updated":1443462131000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1207451446000,"name":"Red Sox Natives","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1098392,"urlname":"natives","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Natives"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Tewksbury","address_1":"553 Main Street","name":"Skybox Restaurant & Sports Bar","lon":-71.25325,"id":23594095,"state":"MA","lat":42.619171,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.2361221313,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443268102000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us to watch the Patriots vs the Jaguars.

It is in a secluded woodland setting on the edge of a beautiful clean pond. Because Pam Golden and her family have been part of the sauna community for decades, she was able to arrange for us to have it to ourselves on September 27th.<\/p> <p>The sauna is central to traditional Finnish culture, a sanctified environment for cleansing, healing, and life passages from childbirth through dying. Finns believe the sauna is a cure-all for any malady, as the steam cleanses the body of toxins, opens up the lungs and is generally invigorating. Important family and community deliberations are conducted in the sauna, with guidelines for feeding the spirits and speaking with quiet courtesy. Dreams and visions are incubated there. It serves as a form of \"red tent\" for women's life cycle rituals.<\/p> <p>Don't worry if you haven't done a sauna before!

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options.

That means that conditions for photographing this event should be perfect.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I will also provide you with the basics of creating a time lapse of the event.\u00a0 You will need the right equipment and patience.<\/p> <p><b>Key times of the evening:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Partial Eclipse begins at 9:07 PM\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Full Eclipse begins at 10:11 PM \u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Maximum Eclipse at 10:47 PM<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Full Eclipse ends at 11:23 PM<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Partial Eclipse ends at 12:27 AM<\/p> <p><b>Equipment:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A sturdy tripod is is a must and a remote shutter release is preferable.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A normal to medium wide 50 mm and wider for a good panoramic scape<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A telephoto lens or a long zoom lens at around 200mm or greater if you want frame filling images.\u00a0 Not the most suitable for time-lapse.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Cameras capable of internal intervalometers and or an eternal intervalometer will be required for any time-lapse capture<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A small flashlight or headlamp (are filter is ideal)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A small folding chair or camping stool - the total eclipse duration is over 3.5 hours<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A warm jacket, hat and if you are smart - a pair of gloves.\u00a0 A thermos with a hot beverage is advisable.<\/p> <p>We will meet at the Boston Harbor walk in the short term parking area of Boston Harbor Towers, 85 East India Row.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

The shot below was taken in 100% cloud cover (with occasional opening and intermittent rain). Also a great opportunity for time lapse photography. Very good chances for a spectacular event. The place we go to will have quite a bit of space.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/eclipse\/lunar\/2015-september-28\">Here is a link to a good overview<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Shooting the blood moon is very challenging, <b>this is not for everyone!<\/b> The brightness of the moon drops by seven (!) stops going from full moon to blood moon. You will need to adjust settings as the moon gets more obstructed and when it is fully obstructed, you need to quickly change from something like f\/11, 1\/200th second and ISO 100 to f\/4, 1\/100th second and ISO 800 or worse. If it is windy, you will have problems holding your lens steady and if you have only one camera, you will need to do both foreground and moon shots and change lenses accordingly. Very challenging shoot and I recommend that you participate only if you feel comfortable with all that (including being up all night on what will be a Monday morning).<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/0\/e\/600_441627406.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>6:25 pm: The moon comes up in the East, in case you want to capture it close to the horizon, but it will make for a long night.<\/p> <p><br\/>7:30pm: It gets dark<\/p> <p><br\/>8:11pm: Penumbral eclipse (slightly less brightness) begins<\/p> <p><br\/><b>9:07pm: Partial Eclipse begins, 119\u00b028.6' Partial moon eclipse starts - moon is starting to get red and is 27\u00b0 above horizon<br\/><\/b> <b><br\/>10:11pm: Total Eclipse begins, 133\u00b037.7' Total moon eclipse starts - completely red (blood) moon.

This particular full moon is special all by itself because it is a \"super-moon\" -- at its closest point to the earth. \u00a0A super moon appears 14% larger and 30% brighter because of its closeness.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But this rare super-moon is even more rare, because at 8:11, it will start to pass through the shadow of our earth. As the lunar eclipse progresses, it turns blood red as our earth blocks most of the sun's light, but the red light still makes it past us, and is reflected back to us, turning the moon an apparent red.<\/p> <p>That gives us the extremely rare, full, super, blood moon. \u00a0Last seen in 1982, and not to be seen again until 2033.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Timing<\/b><\/p> <p>9:15PM:\u00a0Meet at the second parking lot north on Route 138. \u00a0If you are coming from Route 128, we will be just past the Trailside Museum.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words.

Fixing one problem can easily create many others. Without good tools to measure the impact of relevancy changes, there\u2019s no way to know if the \u201cfix\u201d that you\u2019ve developed will cause relevancy problems with other queries. Ideally, much like we have unit tests for code to detect when bugs are introduced, we would like to create ways to measure changes in relevancy.<\/p> <p>This is exactly what was done at OSC. They have developed a series of tools and practices that allow them to work with content experts to define metrics for search quality. Once defined, they can instantly measure the impact of modifying their relevancy strategy, allowing them to iterate quickly on very difficult relevancy problems.<\/p> <p><i>Doug Turnbull<\/i><\/p> <p>Is a Solr and Elasticsearch consultant for OpenSource Connections and the author of the book \"Relevant Search\". Doug lives and breathes smart, relevant search and focuses on moving his clients away from basic text matching to search with domain and business intelligence built in. He leverages search engine features such as Lucene internals and user signals to craft more relevant search results. Doug bridges the gap between content experts, search analytics, and technologists. To help bridge the gap, Doug created Quepid, a search relevancy collaboration canvas used extensively in OpenSource Connection's search work, and Splainer a Solr search results explanation tool and sandbox.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-England-Search-Technologies-NEST-Group\/events\/224975596\/","yes_rsvp_count":39,"name":"Test Driven Search Relevancy","id":"224975596","time":1443564000000,"updated":1443621345000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420916302000,"name":"New England Search Technologies (NEST) Group","group_lon":-71.1999969482,"id":18320037,"urlname":"New-England-Search-Technologies-NEST-Group","group_lat":42.5099983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"51 Melcher St.","name":"WeWork","lon":-71.050056,"id":23789453,"state":"MA","lat":42.349411,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.25622963905,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442862348000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for our next event in MA.

Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/225002041\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Play\/Learn Kitty Whist","id":"225002041","time":1443565800000,"updated":1443628633000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":9.75946521759,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440435328000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you have a family member or friend who wants to get in shape but doesn't know how to start?

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/225571602\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytmbmc","time":1443565800000,"updated":1443578623000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"438 Somerville Avenue","name":"Cambridge Hackspace @ P.irateship","lon":-71.10244,"id":24079947,"state":"MA","lat":42.381321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.22099041939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440949966000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Spend some time on your project by bringing it along to our weekly project night, an evening designed around you and what you're working on.<\/p> <p>This weekly event is about finding time to tinker, being creative, and meeting other members of the community. \u00a0You'll get the chance to see what others are working on, share your projects, and to get inspiration and feedback from fellow tinkerers.<\/p> <p>On any given Tuesday night you have people working on\u00a0electronics, knitting, writing code, wood-working, or just their plans for world domination.

Complete with golems and magic and miraculous escapes and evil nemeses and even hand-to-hand Antarctic battle, it pursues the most important questions of love and war, dreams and art, across pages brimming with longing and hope. Samuel Klayman--self-described little man, city boy, and Jew--first meets Josef Kavalier when his mother shoves him aside in his own bed, telling him to make room for their cousin, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Prague. It's the beginning, however unlikely, of a beautiful friendship. In short order, Sam's talent for pulp plotting meets Joe's faultless, academy-trained line, and a comic-book superhero is born. A sort of lantern-jawed equalizer clad in dark blue long underwear, the Escapist \"roams the globe, performing amazing feats and coming to the aid of those who languish in tyranny's chains!\" Before they know it, Kavalier and Clay (as Sam Klayman has come to be known) find themselves at the epicenter of comics' golden age.<\/p> <p>But Joe Kavalier is driven by motives far more complex than your average hack. In fact, his first act as a comic-book artist is to deal Hitler a very literal blow. (The cover of the first issue shows the Escapist delivering \"an immortal haymaker\" onto the F\u00fchrer's realistically bloody jaw.) In subsequent years, the Escapist and his superhero allies take on the evil Iron Chain and their leader Attila Haxoff--their battles drawn with an intensity that grows more disturbing as Joe's efforts to rescue his family fail.

Williams successfully raised funds through her \"Nubia Comes to Boston\" Kickstarter Campaign and will be using these funds to hire young emerging talent from Artists for Humanity and Empire Beauty School for photography, hair and makeup. Accessories will be provided by Boutikey, a Boston boutique carrying emerging designers. Williams aims to inspire the youth to make their creativity profitable and provide the professional\/educational opportunities to do so.<\/p> <p>For this collection, Williams will be taking you on a cultural journey to Ancient Nubia, the neglected and fading culture who's pyramids will soon be part of an underwater Atlantis, engulfed by its own Nile river. This culture will be illustrated through both conceptual and Ready-to-Wear fashion. You can expect good music, savory bites, raffles, gift bags, and most importantly, a FABULOUS runway show.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!
