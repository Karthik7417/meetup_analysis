We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East.

There are &lt;a&gt;multiple games&lt;\/a&gt; going on at once, so getting involved in a game is &lt;a&gt;easy&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p> <p><br\/>For those of you unfamiliar with the term, a Table Top RPG (Role &lt;a&gt;Playing&lt;\/a&gt; Game) is a type of game where the players create characters based on the \u00a0story\/system available and one person acts as a storyteller. Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from. Beginning on your third RPG event, you may choose to make an original character for whatever game you're currently participating in.<\/p> <p><br\/>Can I run my own game?: If you would like to run your own game, please contact Justin or Cat to reserve a slot.<\/p> <p><br\/>Need Dice?: Please bring yours if you have some if you need extra I will provide some.<\/p> <p><b>Games Currently Running:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jutin: Full Steam Ahead\u00a0<\/p> <p>A new steampunk-inspired RPG by Justin.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCat: Monster of the Week<\/p> <p>A game of investigating and fighting the things that go bump in the night.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Jim &amp; Beth produced their first vintage in 1992. This property continues to produce <b>Merlot<\/b>.<\/p> <p>In 1996, the Summers expanded their vineyard holdings to include <b>25 acres<\/b> at the corner of Highway 128 &amp; Tubbs Lane. This Napa Valley property carries the name Summers Estate Wines. While the property has been completely transformed to recognize its full potential producing <b>Cabernet Sauvignon<\/b>, the rare, yet delicious grape <b>Charbono<\/b> &amp; small amounts of old vine <b>Zinfandel<\/b> (for sale only at the winery). With a winery\/tasting room, entertainment center, bocce ball court, picnic area &amp; 22+ acres of vines, Jim &amp; Beth Summers think this property possesses the perfect balance of pleasure &amp; productivity.<\/p> <p>The signature, \u201cunique\u201d wine offered by Summers is Charbono. The name is thought to be an early Italian immigrant version of Charbonneau, a French varietal. Some strongly believe that this variety is a close relative to the Dolcetto variety, widely grown in northern Italy. The vine bears very large berries that are used to make a very dark red wine that, when subjected to extended skin contact during fermentation, is full of fruit flavor and low in tannins.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Summers produce Chardonnay with grapes from artisanal producer Stuhlmuller Vineyards in Healdsburg, CA.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Today, Summers Estate Winery produces less than 14,000 cases of wine, truly the very definition of an artisanal Napa producer with a strong emphasis on its unique expression of what the French call \u201cterroir.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.summerswinery.com\/\">www.summerswinery.com<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/a\/4\/7\/600_441419975.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>ABOVE: Jim Summers with Winemaker &amp; Vineyard Manager Ignacio Blancas in the Tasting Room at Summers Estates Winery<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Summers Estate Winery on Facebook:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Summers-Estate-Wines\/73224829305\">www.facebook.com\/pages\/Summers-Estate-Wines\/[masked]<\/a><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Join Summers' Estate Bacchus &amp; Bocce Wine Club:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.summerswinery.com\/theclub\/\">www.summerswinery.com\/theclub\/<\/a><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/600_441420197.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>The Four Wines for Skinners Loft on September 15th...<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/2\/600_441421682.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Summers Chardonnay Reserve 2013\u00a0 <\/b>\u00a0 <b>$27\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p>Stuhlmuller Vineyard, Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.summerswinery.com\/\">www.summerswinery.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b>2013 Vintage is not yet rated.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2012 Vintage:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>91 Pts \u2013 <i>Wine Enthusiast<\/i>, April, 2014<\/b><\/p> <p>Rich &amp; delicious, this single-vineyard Chardonnay features ripe flavors of pears, mangoes, oranges, pineapples &amp; new oak.

Secrets of 20 Billion Software Components, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/derekeweeks\">Derek Weeks<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Every software development organization on the planet has a software supply chain that is consuming a massive volume of open source and third-party components at extremely high velocity. To provide a much clearer perspective to this volume and velocity, we can see that a global population more than 11 million developers consumed over 20 billion components in 2014.<\/p> <p>Those in AppSec who have pursued improved visibility, supplier choices, and control mechanisms across their software supply chains have boosted developer productivity by 15%, crumbled mountains of security debt, and shifted millions of dollars from sustaining operations to accelerating innovation.<\/p> <p>Yet the vast majority of organizations developing software are blind to their free-for-all consumption volume, patterns, and velocity. Their software supply chain practices are silently sabotaging efforts to accelerate development, improve efficiency and maintain the integrity of their applications.<\/p> <p>In May, I authored the 2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report. It is a quantitative analysis of more than 160,000 software development organizations consuming billions of open source and third-party software components from over 15,000 suppliers. Included in my analysis is a deep dive into practices of the largest Financial Services firms. Your organization is most likely among those I analyzed.<\/p> <p>While the average organization in the study consumed 240,000 open source and third party software components in 2014, the study revealed:<\/p> <p>An average of 15,337 components consumed included known security flaws, impacting the integrity of operations<\/p> <p>75% of organizations lack policies that control the use of open source and third-party components that are making their way through their software supply chains and into production<\/p> <p>An average application has 24 known open source security flaws, electively built in by the development team<\/p> <p>But this discussion is not intended to simply shed light on bad practices, it is about learning. Attendees will gain new visibility as to what\u2019s happening in their own software supply chains, how to avoid these elective risks, and how leading organizations like eBay, ServiceNow, Blackboard, Aetna, the US Air Force, and Department of Homeland Security are applying proven supply chain principles from other industries toward improving their AppSec practices.<\/p> <p>7:00pm - 7:45pm -<b> Session 2<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OWASP-NYC\/members\/?op=leaders\">New York Chapter Global and Local Updates<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Review of OWASP Project Process,<b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/About_OWASP#Project_Coordinator:_Claudia_Casanovas\">Claudia Casanovas, \u00a0The OWASP Foundation, Project Coordinator<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>OWASP Foundation Community News, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/About_OWASP#Community_Manager:_Noreen_Whysel\"><b>Noreen Whysel, The OWASP Foundation, Community Manager\u00a0<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>8:00pm - 8:45pm -<b> Session 3<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Trends in Financial Crimes - How insecure software, poor development practices and poor management enable cybercrime, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rajgoel.com\/\">Raj Goel<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Why does SPAM exist?

Graphical models present a useful abstraction of causal pathways, but there are numerous causal pathways in the real world. It is often not clear whether a causal graph correctly models a given scenario, or when it does, whether we have enough data to estimate causal effects. In such a messy scenario, it would not be a bad decision to abandon the search for causality altogether, if not for the far-reaching, important effects of causality in almost all branches of scientific inquiry.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Here are some examples:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Economic Policy<\/i>: How much does the school you go to affect your future earnings? How bad is military transcription for future earnings or wellbeing of an individual?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u2022\u00a0<i>Political science<\/i>: How do televised ads from presidential candidates affect voter turnouts? Does mandating quotas for women in local government lead to changes in policy?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Human behavior<\/i>: Does public recognition of scholastic ability lead to better performance? If you friend smokes, would you smoke too?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Biology and medicine<\/i>: Does Vitamin-D deficiency increase chances of colorectal cancer? Are heart attack surgeries beneficial for future health of patients?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Web applications<\/i>: How much does the Facebook newsfeed influence the information we are exposed to? How much do recommendation systems shape our purchasing decisions?\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will select a bunch of these as motivating examples and discuss the four main methodologies for estimating causal effects. All through, our goal will be make connections to bayesian networks\/graphical models and show how they can serve as a unifying framework for dealing with causality.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Outline:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Controlled randomized experiments\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Conditioning on observable confounders (back door criterion)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Stratification<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Matching\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Regression(?)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Mechanism-based strategies (Front door criterion)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0Natural experiments<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0As-if experiments<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Instrumental variables<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Regression discontinuities<\/p> <p><b>Recommended Pre-requisites:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Probability Theory (intermediate):<\/i>\u00a0Know what a joint and conditional distribution is. \u00a0Know what marginalizing is.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Graphical Models (intermediate):<\/i>\u00a0Know what a graphical model is. \u00a0Know how to factorize a joint distribution given a graph. \u00a0Know the term \"directed, acyclic graph\".

Her portrait model has canceled, and would he mind slipping into women's shoes and stockings for a few moments so that she can finish the painting on time? \"Of course,\" he answers, \"Anything at all.\" With that, one of the most passionate and unusual love stories of the twentieth century begins.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Inspired by the true story of Danish painter Einar Wegener and his California-born wife; this tender portrait of a marriage asks: What do you do when someone you love wants to change?<\/p> <p><br\/>Einar dresses more and more as Lili - the name given to her by Greta - and what started off as a game becomes a way of life for Greta and Einar. With Lili as her muse, Greta's paintings begin to flourish. A French art dealer spots her work and the couple moves to Paris for the sake of Greta's career. In the permissive air of Paris between the wars, Lili is liberated and increasingly becomes Greta's companion on public outings. As Einar fades into memory they realize that a choice must be made: Lili or Einar. Greta finds a surgeon-psychologist at the Dresden Municipal Women's Clinic, and Einar travels to Germany to become, once and for all, Lili Elbe.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/4\/7\/1\/600_440634385.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Amazon.com Review<\/b><\/p> <p>Though the title character of David Ebershoff's debut novel is a transsexual, the book is less concerned with transgender issues than the mysterious and ineffable nature of love. Loosely based on the life of Danish painter Einar Wegener who, in 1931, became the first man to undergo a sex-change operation, The Danish Girl borrows the bare bones of his story as a jumping-off point for an exploration of how Wegener's decisions affected the people around him. Chief among these is his Californian wife, Greta, also a painter, who unwittingly sets her husband's feet on the path to transformation. While trying to finish a portrait of an opera singer who has cancelled a sitting, she asks Einar to stand in for her subject, putting on her dress, stockings, and shoes. The moment silk touches his skin, he is shaken<\/p> <p><i>Einar could concentrate only on the silk dressing his skin, as if it were a bandage. Yes, that was how it felt the first time: the silk was so fine and airy that it felt like a gauze--a balm-soaked gauze lying delicately on healing skin. Even the embarrassment of standing before his wife began to no longer matter, for she was busy painting with a foreign intensity in her face. Einar was beginning to enter a shadowy world of dreams where Anna's dress could belong to anyone, even to him.<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p>Greta soon recognizes her husband's affinity for feminine attire, and encourages him not only to dress like a woman, but to take on a woman's persona, as well. \"Why don't we call you Lili?\" she suggests. What starts out as a harmless game soon evolves into something deeper, and potentially threatening to their marriage. Yet Greta's love proves to be enduring if not immutable. As Einar inexorably transforms, he steps beyond \"that small dark space between two people where a marriage exists\" and Greta lets him go.<\/p> <p>Ebershoff does a remarkable job of historical prestidigitation, creating the sights and sounds and smells of 1930s Denmark and making it seem easy. Even more remarkable is his treatment of Greta: he gets inside her head and heart, and renders her in such loving detail that her reactions make perfect sense. Einar is more of a cipher, and ultimately less interesting than his wife. But in the end, this is Greta's book and David Ebershoff has done her proud. The Danish Girl marks a promising fictional debut. --Sheila Bright --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\u00a0&lt;a

\u00a0Data Literacy Beyond the 3 V's<\/p> <p><br\/><i>***PLEASE NOTE: We are trying a unique forum this time as our guest speaker will be presenting remotely to our live meeting at StackExchange. We believe this will facilitate an even broader array of top thought-leaders globally while still fostering our Skeptics community. This event will be recorded. Your feedback is much appreciated. Steven Mornelli. ***<\/i><\/p> <p>Dr. Kirk Borne will address one of the fundamental building blocks of data science know-how and analytics capability that is often over-looked. That core competency is data and statistical literacy. There is so much focus on the abundant uses of data resources, analytics tools, and data science algorithms that we often overlook some of the unavoidable abuses and misuses that creep in.\u00a0 A related problem that we frequently encounter is the lack of scientific literacy -- i.e., the lack of understanding that science is a process and methodology, based on hypothesis, experimentation, and testing -- science is not simply a collection of facts.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Concepts that contribute to data and statistical literacies will be discussed. These may include:\u00a0proper use versus the abuse\u00a0and misuse of statistics, maps, and graphs; fallacious reasoning; deduction versus inference from data; bias versus objectivity in the interpretation of data. Additional data literacies include understanding of concepts like these:\u00a0data types, modeling approaches (supervised\u00a0versus\u00a0unsupervised), training\u00a0versus\u00a0testing datasets, model accuracy\u00a0versus\u00a0precision,overfitting\u00a0versus\u00a0underfitting,\u00a0and\u00a0descriptive\u00a0versus\u00a0predictive analytics.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As data scientists, we may take an understanding of\u00a0such basic concepts\u00a0as a given, and consequently assume that our corporate executives, clients, or data science initiates will grasp our jargon and appreciate the wonders of the support vector machine, or the random forest, or local linear embedding. The requisite data and statistical literacies could exist in some cases, but it is not a safe starting assumption when consulting, advising, training, and communicating data analytics benefits and results to a broader audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Various data and statistical literacies will be illustrated through examples, including some classic cases and some real-life failures in the media. In order to communicate effectively the value and validity of our data analytics processes and results, let us keep in mind that we must first contribute to the data literacy of our audiences.<\/p> <p>BIO: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kirk Borne is the Principal Data Scientist for the NextGen Analytics and Data Science workstream within the Strategic Innovation Group atBooz Allen Hamilton. He previously spent 12 years as Professor at George Mason University in the Computational and Data Sciences program. Before that, he worked 18 years on various NASA contracts, as research scientist and manager on large data systems. He has a PhD in Astrophysics from Caltech. He has applied his expertise in science and data systems as a consultant and advisor to numerous agencies and firms, focusing on the use of data for discovery, decision support, and innovation across many different domains and industries.

Richard Gere delivers a soul-baring performance as George, a man whose struggle to find food and a place to sleep in New York City is beautifully captured with remarkable realism and heartrending compassion. Shuffled into the unforgiving bureaucracy of a men\u2019s shelter, George seems destined to wind up as just another lost soul swallowed up by the system\u2014until he meets a gregarious, down-and-out ex-jazzman (played by Broadway legend Ben Vereen) who inspires George to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Jena Malone).

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Discovering a colorful cast of New Yorkers attempting to resist the culture of Total Work, Powers offers an inspiring exploration for anyone trying to make urban life more people- and planet-friendly.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GreenNewYorkers\/events\/225079431\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"New Slow City book talk, Sept. 16 ","id":"225079431","time":1442444400000,"updated":1442457431000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280001527000,"name":"Green New Yorkers","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1680350,"urlname":"GreenNewYorkers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Green New Yorkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"33 E 17th St, 3rd Floor Starbucks","name":"Barnes and Noble","lon":-74.005943,"id":24095969,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440107854000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone, let's get together to meet each other and expand our network of New York based Producers and Freelancers.<\/p> <p>At our first meetup, we'll share how we go about meeting new people and finding more work in the industry, as well as talk about ways to make that easier.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Film-and-Video-Production-Meetup\/events\/224773734\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Networking and Strategies for Finding More Work","id":"224773734","time":1442444400000,"updated":1442457357000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440080991000,"name":"New York Film and Video Production Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":18851573,"urlname":"New-York-Film-and-Video-Production-Meetup","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"124 W36th street ","name":"Raw New York Studio","lon":-73.826897,"id":24006781,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440757625000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This event is now official \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's shoot Bodyscapes. \u00a0 up to 4 Female nude models will be placed for photographers to shoot bodyscapes.<\/p> <p>Right now $50 per photographer, this price will rise daily. \u00a0pay at <a href=\"http:\/\/streakarts.com\/main\/tiki-index.php?page=September+16th+Bodyscapes\">streakarts.com\/september16\u00a0<\/a><\/p> <p>You will get model release<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/4\/d\/600_440947245.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Take N,R,Q,F,M,B,D to Herald Square Studio on 36th st.

This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Cond\u00e9 Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve. Wooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is a ahead of her time, and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her life, she begins to realize how our most promising choices inevitably lay the groundwork for our regrets.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>UPDATE<\/b> \/\/ <b>Location <\/b><br\/><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boultonandwattnyc.com\/\">Boulton &amp; Watt<\/a><\/b>, <i>5 Avenue A<\/i><br\/>Join us at this swanky industrial era gastropub; serving cocktails, delicious American dishes, and casual snacks.

Then <b><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i><\/b> may be just for you! Channeled by the same voice that authored ACIM but in more easy to understand language, Mari Perron's <i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> speaks to the heart rather than the mind. Let's explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week, taking breaks whenever Yasuko is away teaching in Japan (usually November, March and July).<\/p> <p>It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice.

One of its greatest assets is its museums, which together house an almost unparalleled embarrassment of riches. These museums draw millions of international visitors each year, yet visiting them can be daunting. Whether or not you consider yourself an art lover: the sheer volume of objects on display can be overwhelming (not to mention the volume of the crowds, or the volume of the noise!). And it's certainly easy to get fatigued. If we're really looking, a single room of art can last us all day, and many of us try to manage much more than that in just a few hours. In order to help you make the most of your museum-going time, Eight Paintings in New York Every Art Lover Should See, taught by Tina Rivers Ryan from Columbia University, suggests not just what you should be looking at, but how you should be looking at it. On Thursday morning September 17th, she will use as examples eight of the most important, stunning, moving, and innovative paintings in New York; the ones that are worth your time, every time. It is designed for both the newly curious and those of you who have made museum-going part of your regular routine. If you're new to looking at art, it will help you find your bearings. If you're already familiar with these collections, it will help you see old favorites with fresh eyes.<\/p> <p>The first four paintings on the list are:<br\/>The Merode Altarpiece, ca. [masked] (The Cloisters)<br\/>Jacques Louis David's The Death of Socrates 1787 (The Met)<br\/>Turner's The Harbor of Dieppe, 1826 (The Frick)<br\/>Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, 1907 (MoMA)<\/p> <p>Paintings to be announced on the day of the event:<br\/>Rembrandt painting (The Frick)<br\/>Manet painting (The Met)<br\/>Monet painting (MoMA)<br\/>Warhol painting (MoMA)<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/onedayu.com\/events\/detail\/291\">CLICK HERE TO REGISTER<\/a><br\/>Use code NYART this week only to pay just $49 then price goes up to $69.<\/p> <p>OR CALL[masked]<\/p> <p><b>Tina Rivers Ryan<\/b>\u00a0\u2013 Tina Rivers Ryan is an art historian and critic specializing in modern and contemporary art.

On the other hand, relationships are necessary for our health as well as for business. Why do we see this disconnect? It\u2019s because when networking in the 20th century we often forgot that we need to engage first as human beings, not as job functions and titles. To help us evolve beyond that outdated concept of networking, Relationship Design expert Michael Roderick has created a 21st century Relationship Adventure for us. Using one-on-one and small group exercises, activities, and missions, Michael will help us replace the ickiness of networking with an exploration of what makes us authentic and unique. He will curate an experience and integrate play to accelerate and enhance the good old fashioned activity of getting to know one another.<\/p> <p>Business is all about relationships, and the more diverse, the better. With this in mind, PDMA will embark on this adventure together with the Marketing Executive Networking Group (MENG), a group of professionals most of us don\u2019t know.<\/p> <p>Facilitator: Michael Roderick<\/p> <p>When Michael went from high school teacher to Broadway producer in under two years people started to ask him how he managed it. Michael began his career as a high school English teacher before producing Off Broadway and then on Broadway. This combination of experience in the arts and entrepreneurship led to Michael starting an arts incubator program to teach more artists about building and growing their own businesses (PLAE). Eventually, he decided to develop a workshop on networking which grew into a full time consulting practice and that became Small Pond Enterprises. Michael took a short break to work as the V.P. of Operations and as a Director of Business Development for an NYC Ed. Tech Startup which introduced him to the New York Startup community. Most recently, Michael founded The Connecting Connectors Conference (ConnectorCon) as well as Relationship Adventure Day Date: Thursday, September 17, 2015<\/p> <p>Time: 5:30 \u2013 8:30 PM (Presentation begins promptly at 5:45)<\/p> <p>Pricing:<\/p> <p>PDMA Members - FREE<br\/>Non Members and Students: $10<br\/>Location:<\/p> <p>Acquis Consulting Group Headquarters,<br\/>299 Broadway (between Duane and Reade Streets<br\/>12th Floor (take elevator to 12th floor and turn left)<\/p> <p>New York, NY<\/p> <p>Note:<\/p> <p>Space is limited - register early - first come, first served<br\/>Light refreshments will be provided<br\/>Please wear comfortable shoes as the excercises may require some walking around<br\/>About MENG:<\/p> <p>The Marketing Executives Networking Group (MENG) is a national network of top-level marketing executives at the VP\/Director level or higher in major companies and CEOs of entrepreneurial marketing research and marketing consulting firms.
