He started teaching through Meetup earlier this year and has as his goal to bring professional level instruction to the public at a rate that leaves no one behind. This demands tight scheduling of both his time and the room rental with Ripley-Grier Studios.For these reasons, I will be insisting to him that \"no shows\" be dropped from the group.

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713568\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713568","time":1457218800000,"updated":1457224084000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"5th St & Ave C","name":"5C Cafe and Cultural Center in NYC ","lon":-73.979729,"id":24364228,"state":"NY","lat":40.7229,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.95215582848,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455310187000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>LADY GOT CHOPS Festival @ 5C Cafe and Cultural Center in NYC @ 6-7pm (5th St &amp; Ave C)<br\/>Premiering \"electric Meg on Trumpet show, Sonic Mundi<\/p> <p><br\/>Fee: Pay What You Can<\/p> <p>We are planning on having dinner in china Town after this event.

The last animal based movie they made was 8 years ago with \"Bolt\" in 2008. Zootopia is looking to be a very good modernized animation, with throwbacks to the old classic cartoons that alot of us grew-up with back in the day.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This looks to be Disney going back to their roots and doing exactly what Disney has traditionally done best - talking animal cartoons.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/5\/600_447189173.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAMC Village 7 is the NEW chosen venue.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>I just double checked google. \u00a0The Regal Union Square movie theater will not be featuring Zootopia on March 5.

(Blindfolds will be provided but feel free to bring your own).<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 If you wish to drink with us please contribute a bottle of wine or a cocktails (what is a party without it!).<\/p> <p>3. Everyone will bring a prepared dish to this party. You can make whatever you want, but we encourage you to bring something with a combination of flavors that people usually would not think to combine.<\/p> <p>We will not reveal what we made until the end of the dinner. If you have dietary restrictions please let us know so that you will not be served anything that you can not eat.<\/p> <p>At the last dining in the dark dinner party we learned that 8 courses is a lot of food! Please prepare so that there is only a tapas size portion for every one. It is more than enough. Also make sure to come hungry!<\/p> <p>4. Everyone will be a server once. We will serve everyone's dish one at a time. When it is time to\u00a0 serve\u00a0 your dish you will remove your blindfold and serve everyone.<\/p> <p>The fine print:<\/p> <p>Cancellations: Please be 100% committed to attending this event, and cancel 48 hours in advance. There is limited space and each member puts in a lot of time, effort, and planning into each of these events. Late cancellations affect the group as a whole. If you cancel with less than 48 hours notice, or are a no show you could be removed from the group.Additionally if you regularly RSVP yes to events to hold a spot and then cancel you will also be removed from the group.<\/p> <p>*I have a small 7lb Yorkie Poo named pepper.

Be sure to bring plenty of water, and either lunch or snacks as needed. Well-behaved trail dogs welcome, as I will likely be bringing my super-friendly German shepherd.<\/p> <p>*** While I'm no speed-burner, because this is a traverse with a shuttle, please know your hiking speed. Hiking at 2.5 is an overall average, which means more like 3 mph on flat ground. I hope to be done in less than 4 hours, but I put 5 to account for shuttle times and \"worst case\" scheduling.<\/p> <p>This section starts along the Basha Kill Rail Trail. The trail follows the abandoned \"Kingston Line\" of the New York, Ontario &amp; Western (O&amp;W) Railroad. While the walk along the Basha Kill is straight and level, it is a wonderful area, with many fine views across the Basha Kill, one of the largest wetlands in southern New York. After leaving the Basha Kill the trail follows roads for about 2 miles through the Village of Wurtsboro\u00a0on its way\u00a0to the Wurtsboro Ridge. Upon leaving Old Route 17 (Sullivan County Route 171), the Long Path quickly gains the ridgetop. This ridgetop trail section is one of the most dramatic in southern New York, with many spectacular views in all directions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>HUDSON VALLEY HIKER LEGAL DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Waiver of liability<\/i><\/p> <p>You agree when you sign up for this group or any of the events that you have read and understand the below.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike (or any other event), please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness and well-being and will hold no one else liable in case of injury or mishap.

warm-up ride before the season of longer rides since weather will be colder and conditions may be a bit iffy! \u00a0Always nice to have the option to bail on subways if the weather turns sour.<\/p> <p>So we have a bit of everything in this ride. \u00a0It's more of a social ride for the most part, but it's easy to zip ahead and meet back up with the group at the three major stopping points. \u00a0 It's about 35 miles of street riding if you do the whole round trip except for the Kissena Velodrome and Prospect Park if anyone is up for a loop or two, add some mileage for that. \u00a0Sprinkled in there is a stop at the Jackson Hole diner that is right near Laguardia and a quick stop at Plane View park to watch the planes come in to land at Laguardia right over your head (that's pretty cool if you've never done it before, they come in one right after another). \u00a0After Prospect Park those who want can grab a beer!<\/p> <p>\u00a0Here's a brief summary and an option or two for those who want to sleep in later or head right over to the Velodrome.<\/p> <p>Starting at 10AM from Union Square we head uptown then into Queens and Ditmar Ave up to Jackson Hole Diner (about 10 miles only but better to eat before than after the ride!) for a late breakfast and some fuel for the Velodrome and ride home. \u00a0We probably won't get out of the diner until about 12:30. \u00a0So if you want to skip the food just get to the diner at 12:30 and you should be fine. \u00a0(Send a message at[masked], or leave a message here if you decide to do that)<\/p> <p>After that we head over to the Plane View Park which is very close by and we'll check out the planes for about 15 minutes or so.<\/p> <p>Then its 7 miles to the Kissena Velodrome (I can't guarantee it will be open and\/or usable but I've been there a few times and it has always been and it's never been too busy). \u00a0You can use any kind of bike you want on it. \u00a0It's something you should really do at least once if you have a bike and you are in NY. \u00a0A lot of folks don't like it at all and others love it! \u00a0If you want to just head over to the Velodrome and then join us on the ride back figure you need to get there at about 1:30.\u00a0(Send a message at[masked], or leave a message here if you decide to do that)<\/p> <p>Then we head over to Prospect Park, for another 12 miles. \u00a0Anyone wanting to do a loop or two can, anyone wanting to grab a beer or two can. \u00a0At this point you can do one or two of anything I won't stop you. \u00a0It's another 6 miles back to Union

Look for a waterway that is fast-moving, featuring waterfalls and rapids.<\/p> <p>2<\/p> <p>Check the surrounding hills for signs of quartz and mineralization. Both gold and quartz begin their formation as veins inside large rocks. Remember that gold will be present only in a mineral-rich area.<\/p> <p>Locate a section of the river that is deep enough to completely submerge your pan. Watch the strength of the current as well. You need a steady water flow that will move silt downstream, but not so rapid that it interferes with panning.<\/p> <p>4<\/p> <p>Find a promising spot by looking at the river's natural features. Large tree trunks, gravel bars, moss and bends in the river are prime locations for panning.<\/p> <p>5<\/p> <p>Work a few test pans from the spot you've chosen. Look for black sand as you pan; gold will not appear where there is no black sand. If you're not having any luck from the initial pans, move on and try another spot.<\/p> <p>\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_11416314_locate-spot-pan-gold.html#ixzz2FhxHgOkY\">How to Locate a Spot to Pan for Gold | eHow.com<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_11416314_locate-spot-pan-gold.html#ixzz2FhxHgOkY\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_11416314_locate-spot-pan-gold.html#ixzz2FhxHgOkY\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_11416314_locate-spot-pan-gold.html#ixzz2FhxHgOkY<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/prospector\/events\/229199132\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Exploring an old Gold Mine  Day Trip to Connecticut","id":"229199132","time":1457276400000,"updated":1457412648000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1351394057000,"name":"North East Gold Prospectors & Treasure Hunters","group_lon":-73.9300003052,"id":5590172,"urlname":"prospector","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Prospectors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"839 W 181st St","name":"Le Ch\u00e9ile","lon":-73.940025,"id":21676022,"state":"NY","lat":40.851368,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.49090337753,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452893533000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>A two hour timed, out &amp; back run on the Palisades Park Long Path.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Where: <\/b>South entrance of the GW bridge sidewalk on the Manhattan side.<\/p> <p><b>When:<\/b> 10 am<\/p> <p><b>Trail Details<\/b>: We'll run over the GW bridge, to the Palisades long path.

Clouds spread out forever and rough water turns smooth as silk. It took a lot of video watching, gear purchasing and tons of trial and error.

For the first session (12:00PM - 1:30PM), we will go over all of the gear used for shooting long exposures. For the second session (2:00PM - 3:30PM), we will go over the settings and techniques used. There will also be a Q&amp;A portion so we can go over misconceptions that are commonly spread. If you're like me, you learn from experience, so part two of the workshop will be held outdoors. Stay tuned to the NYC Photographers MeetUp for the next event where we will take everything discussed during the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adorama.com\/?sterm=xrxzmhV2nUuJQTUVvb3nOVnTUkSwZ4TcEQwYRw0&amp;kbid=\">Adorama<\/a> workshop, and put it to use outdoors.\u00a0<\/p> <p>And to top it all off, we're going to have a raffle!

As orator, consul, lawyer and moralist Cicero, the New Man from Arpino, enigmatically embodied more of the traditionalist ideals than most of his Old Guard peers.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

A passionate and dedicated writer from an early age, Durrell s prolific career also included the groundbreaking Avignon Quintet, whose first novel, \"Monsieur \"(1974), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and whose third novel, \"Constance \"(1982), was nominated for the Booker Prize. He also penned the celebrated travel memoir \"Bitter Lemons of Cyprus \"(1957), which won the Duff Cooper Prize. Durrell corresponded with author Henry Miller for forty-five years, and Miller influenced much of his early work, including a provocative and controversial novel, \"The Black Book \"(1938). Durrell died in France in 1990.\" - <i>Amazon.com<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0____________________________\u00a0<\/p> <p>** <b>NOTE<\/b> : I WILL BE EMAILING MEMBERS ASKING YOU TO CONFIRM YOUR \"YES\" RSVP A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE MEETUP, WITH YOUR REPLY DUE NO LATER THAN APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT SO WE CAN GET A PRETTY ACCURATE HEADCOUNT.

Join us for our monthly introspective meetup, where we look into ourselves and try to figure out how to be better profeminist men. This month we'll look at two topics that were tabled last week and discuss them for 30 minutes each:<\/p> <p>***1. Feminism and the 2016 Presidential election***<br\/>Is feminism informing your choice of candidate for the 2016 Presidential election? If so, whom are you supporting? On the Democratic side of the race, TIME Magazine claims that Bernie Sanders is winning feminists (<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4220427\/bernie-sanders-wellesley-hillary-clinton-femisim\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/time.com\/4220427\/bernie-sanders-wellesley-hillary-clinton-femisim\/<\/a>) while The Nation points out that electing a female President could help animate the conversation about gender inequality in the way that electing Barack Obama brought to the surface the enduring power of racial animus in the United States (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/why-this-socialist-feminist-is-for-hillary\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/why-this-socialist-feminist-is-for-hillary\/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>***2. Interacting with the world: Nicholas Kristof***<br\/>During our last meeting, we compiled a list of model male profeminists and the very first one to come up was New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. Several news outlets, including The Feminist Wire (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thefeministwire.com\/2013\/03\/op-ed-nicholas-kristof-and-the-politics-of-writing-about-womens-oppression-in-darker-nations\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thefeministwire.com\/2013\/03\/op-ed-nicholas-kristof-and-the-politics-of-writing-about-womens-oppression-in-darker-nations\/<\/a>), Buzzfeed (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/annanorth\/the-anti-nicholas-kristof-backlash#.igjgJY04yX\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/annanorth\/the-anti-nicholas-kristof-backlash#.igjgJY04yX<\/a>), and The Guardian (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/cifamerica\/2012\/mar\/26\/nick-kristof-anti-sex-trafficking-crusade\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/cifamerica\/2012\/mar\/26\/nick-kristof-anti-sex-trafficking-crusade<\/a>), have been critical of Nicholas Kristof's methods as being counterproductive, simplistic, and having unintended consequences. Is there any truth to these criticisms? If so, what can we learn from them about the ways to productively, maturely, and deliberately address the oppression of less privileged groups than our own?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Male-Feminist-Initiative\/events\/229186260\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":3600000,"name":"Introspective","id":"229186260","time":1457287200000,"updated":1457300985000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444759509000,"name":"Male Profeminists of NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19024302,"urlname":"New-York-Male-Feminist-Initiative","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Profeminists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Corner of Central Park West & W 81st st","name":"The American Museum of Natural History","lon":-73.971764,"id":725610,"state":"NY","lat":40.781986,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.41216111183,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446393315000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Brights, locals and visitors, out of state and international!<\/p> <p>Also, to those who are curious about The Brights (the-brights.net) or who we are allied with.

SCHWARTZ<\/p> <p><b>Program (Live Event)<\/b><b>: <\/b>Ed will apply a two-part approach to his talk: In Part 1, he will review his book. In Part 2, he will discuss the new book he is writing with the former girlfriend of the falsely accused Lee Harvey Oswald and will present circumstantial evidence to prove that Oswald did not shoot and kill President Kennedy.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><b>: <\/b>Edward Schwartz graduated from Lehman College in the Bronx, NYC in 1966. He was trained for combat duty in Vietnam in a basic training program at Fort Dix, NJ in the early months of 1965 at the time when President Lyndon Johnson sent a Marine invasion force to Vietnam. In 2007 Ed wrote a book on \u201cThe Kennedy Assassination - The Betrayal of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Presidency\u201d. In 2013 Ed revised the book after realizing that the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq orchestrated by President George H. W. Bush was unjustified. Ed is currently working with Judith Vary Baker, author of \u201cMe &amp; Lee\u201d and \u201cDavid Ferrie\u201d as co-author on a book about the Kennedy assassination. The theme of this new book is, \u201cThe Kennedy Assassination: The Cover Up and the Consequences\u201d.<\/p> <p>Please plan to attend what is bound to be one of the most interesting DNNY meetings to date and invite your interested friends to join us.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details<\/b><b>: <\/b>Admission $10 per person.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713591\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713591","time":1457290800000,"updated":1457295823000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"109 E 9th St","name":"Central Bar NYC","lon":-73.989862,"id":697624,"state":"NY","lat":40.730515,"repinned":false},"headcount":14,"distance":1.34915542603,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454952740000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/2\/5\/600_446677669.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\"Sad, middle-aged Greg Feely, whose only companions are a dying cat and his collection of porn videos, learns he is actually Ned Slade, top agent of the Hand, an organization dedicated to maintaining the social status quo by eliminating unhealthy variations - biological, technological, or sexual.

It's a great place to learn and have fun in a low pressure friendly setting. Whether you're a regular tournament player or a first-timer, you'll fit right in.<\/p> <p>This time we're trying something new for Gay Planeswalkers. We're going to do a booster draft of Dragons of Tarkir (three packs of Dragons - we will not be using Fate Reforged). If you've not drafted before, it's lots of fun. You will get to build a deck strategically and bring it home with you. Dragons is not rotating out of Standard until December so if you regularly play Standard, you might pick up some new cards. If you don't know what any of that means, don't worry about it. The biggest takeaway is you'll get cards to build a deck and it's fun.<\/p> <p>If you signup, it's $12 which pays for three booster packs (sales tax included). This will be limited to eight people so it will be at my apartment (where I have large tables for drafting). I'll provide the address for those who sign up as it gets closer. There will be no prizes. Per usual, we're getting together to have fun in a casual setting. Everyone's welcome to bring beer or wine. I'll have one or the other to kick things off.<\/p> <p>If you sign up and then cannot make it, we won't be able to play so please be sure you can attend before you click that RSVP button. ;)<\/p> <p>Here's some more specifics on the format:<\/p> <p>At the start of booster draft, each player opens a booster pack and picks a single card. (Don\u2019t show the other players what you pick!) Then everyone passes the rest of their pack to player on their left, each player then picks a card from the pack they just received before passing again. This process continues until all the cards in those packs have been drafted. Then each player opens a second pack, but this time, you pass the pack to your right. After all those cards are drafted, you do the same with the third pack, passing to the left again.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gay-Planeswalkers-NYC\/events\/229183332\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's draft Gay Magic the Gathering - Dragons of Tarkir","id":"229183332","time":1457294400000,"updated":1457327208000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446757189000,"name":"Gay Planeswalkers NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19094134,"urlname":"Gay-Planeswalkers-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Gay Planeswalkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"61 Bergen St","name":"61 Local","lon":-73.990944,"id":22882732,"lat":40.686913,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.36806774139,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456402650000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>And now for something completely different!<\/p> <p>There's an all levels Klezmer workshop on March 6th with the Brooklyn Accordion Meetup and we were asked if we'd like to collaborate, as they would love to have some other instruments present.

Because of this, I will be teaching you how to journey so, when you RSVP, I'll be writing to you individually about journeying - once you RSVP, shoot me an email at [masked], or I will email you through the meetup site.<\/p> <p>Following is the description I sent out for the original meeting, along with some updates.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>As some of you in the group know, I have practiced shamanic journeying for the past 13 years and I have been doing intensive shamanic training for the past two years. My training has been in what is called core shamanism, practices and healing methods distilled from different shamanic traditions around the world. These methods are used for healing, guidance, and gaining insight, inspiration and creativity for oneself and others in the community.<\/p> <p>My offering to our BSFW community is this workshop, in which we will be utilizing shamanic practices to facilitate creativity and to add a new dimension to your writing process.<\/p> <p>In this Shamanic Writing Room meeting, we will do exercises and writing prompts based on the practices of guided journeying (guided meditations) to open up access to deeper creativity. To enter a meditative state, I will lead you by my oral instructions and\/or a drumbeat.<\/p> <p>On your guided journeys, you can meet beings and creatures, both human and non-human, who will inspire you, lead you into other worlds, give you new storylines and ideas, and offer helpful advice. You may see a story unfold or you may personally be involved in the story.<\/p> <p>To begin our afternoon, we will introduce ourselves and you will set your intention and personal goal for the meeting. This could be, for example: I want to write more during the week, I want to break through a block I am experiencing in this story\/novel\/project. We will set up a special collective place with all of our inspiration objects (see below in list of things to bring with you).<\/p> <p>We will enter into a meditative place with some stretching and deep breathing.<\/p> <p>I will teach you how to journey and guide you through the first journey to meet your power animal and your writing guide.<\/p> <p>After, you will write down your experiences and then will be able to share, if you\u2019d like (you don\u2019t have to).<\/p> <p>If we have time, we will do a second journey.<\/p> <p>The meditations (journeys) will be done with my guidance and instruction in a safe and supportive environment.<\/p> <p>After we do the journeys, we will all write together, just as in the traditional Writing Room.<\/p> <p>There will be absolutely no drugs (except coffee!). I will provide coffee and some snacks and you can also bring snacks. I have two cats, in case anyone has allergies.<\/p> <p>Please bring, if you have these:<\/p> <p>eye covering (a scarf works well)<\/p> <p>blanket<\/p> <p>notebook &amp; pens<\/p> <p>coloring materials<\/p> <p>an object, poem, quote, excerpt that inspires you (inspiration objects)<\/p> <p>Following is some background and information about shamanism:<\/p> <p>Shamanism is an ancient spiritual path and practice that has existed for 100,000 years all over the world. What I have studied and what I practice is core shamanism, which distills the integral practices and methods from all traditions.<\/p> <p>It is helpful to remember that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you believe in other worlds or use shamanic language in your own belief system. What is conducive to inspiration is your openness and willingness to try something new. Inspiration occurs in different ways and there is usually a mysterious and unknown aspect to it. If you get a great idea, feel expansions and shifts in perspective, are able to write in a way you never have before, that is what is important. You have your own unique faith and define it for yourself. It is important to honor that in yourself and trust yourself as to what you need, even if you may not know or understand all of the details involved.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you,<\/p> <p>Arielle<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers\/events\/228999281\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Shamanic Writing Room","id":"228999281","time":1457294400000,"updated":1457307930000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1278875895000,"name":"Brooklyn Speculative Fiction Writers","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1673851,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"writers of speculative fiction"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455682725000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The last meeting, we decided to have a participatory study group, where each of us will share some information about the moon: Moon deities, moon magick, moon mythology, moon cycles, etc. 5-10 minute presentation.

The museum focuses on American organized crime through the decades, which includes profiling mob bosses, Prohibition-era gangsters, serial bank robbers, and dastardly Scooby-Doo villains. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/11\/19\/arts\/design\/19gangster.html?_r=2\">New York Times<\/a>\u00a0praised co-owner and tour guide Lorcan Otway as \"so encyclopedic that touring the rooms takes hours,\" as he expounds upon America's unique relationship with hedonism and straight-laced morality.

Everyone should be familiar with the basic rules and concepts of the game, as outlined in this pdf:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tnya.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Polo_Beginners.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Practices typically include a swim set and some conditioning at the beginning, drills, and scrimmaging for the last 30-45 minutes (it's also ok to sit out and watch for the scrimmaging portion if it's your first practice). The first and third Sundays are geared towards scrimmaging and the second and fourth are more focused on skills and\/or conditioning. Bob or\u00a0Jeff\u00a0are the typical coaches. We strive to create a positive and welcoming environment and do not tolerate any unsportsmanlike conduct. There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk in.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels.

I know firsthand the difficulties in letting go of a toxic relationship. For me, my mind was saying one thing - to let go - but my heart was saying something else. Even though I knew in my mind the\u00a0relationship I was in was toxic, my heart just could not break\u00a0the ties and I was determined to do whatever it took to hold on. Thankfully, with the support and encouragement of like-minded community, like this group, I was able to let go and move onto healthier relationships. Today, I no longer need an intimate relationship to make me feel whole. I became\u00a0a certified addiction recovery coach and created this group to share all that I have learned and to create a space for us to connect. \u00a0In this group, we will support one another in\u00a0making healthier choices, which attract healthier relationships,\u00a0and be in community with people, just like you &amp; me, who are looking to heal from toxic relationships and take back our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this meetup, we offer more than just talk.

I know firsthand the difficulties in letting go of a toxic relationship. For me, my mind was saying one thing - to let go - but my heart was saying something else. Even though I knew in my mind the\u00a0relationship I was in was toxic, my heart just could not break\u00a0the ties and I was determined to do whatever it took to hold on. Thankfully, with the support and encouragement of like-minded community, like this group, I was able to let go and move onto healthier relationships. Today, I no longer need an intimate relationship to make me feel whole. I became\u00a0a certified addiction recovery coach and created this group to share all that I have learned and to create a space for us to connect. \u00a0In this group, we will support one another in\u00a0making healthier choices, which attract healthier relationships,\u00a0and be in community with people, just like you &amp; me, who are looking to heal from toxic relationships and take back our lives.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this meetup, we offer more than just talk.

Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/7\/600_447504855.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/funthingstodoinnyctoday\/events\/229255423\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup at Stand Up New York Free, 2 drink min","id":"229255423","time":1457310600000,"updated":1457322380000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1217100557000,"name":"Alternative to the Bar Fun Things To Do In NYC Today!","group_lon":-74,"id":1235637,"urlname":"funthingstodoinnyctoday","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"NYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10029","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Tito Puente Education Complex 240 East 109th Street.

Veganizer works one on one with the Executive Chef to create a mouth watering one time experience like no other. These events sell out fast because NYC is craving new and healthy cuisine outside of the traditional restaurants that we all know and love.<\/p> <p>About Chef Hadara<\/p> <p>Chef Hadara has a resume longer than most and Veganizer is thrilled to be doing their first event collaboration. She has traveled throughout the entire US as a chef and consultant. Her recipes can be found in Whole Foods, TGIF Fridays and more. Her favorite cuisine is Mexican as she has spent much time studying Latin cuisines. She is also the founder of Rawclates, the raw, organic and vegan premium chocolate company.

But one of those Keys has just resurfaced and numerous factions are dead-set on possessing it. This means certain doom for the poor souls who've stumbled upon it.<\/p> <p>Are these unfortunate souls mere pawns in a greater game? Do they even know of that which fate has cast their way?<\/p> <p>If they are truly unaware of the significance of that which they now possess, it would be to their benefit to become aware of it. Fate and destiny have converged upon them and, before long, many will vie to possess the item they hold. Many will seek to become the Keeper of the Keys and our intrepid adventurers stand in their way.<\/p> <p>BACKGROUND:<\/p> <p>\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I am looking to run this campaign as part of the Edison MeetUp group. However, I cannot run\/attend a weekly game. My schedule simply does not allow for it.<\/p> <p>So I'm setting this group up as a bi-weekly game; sort-of. Specifically, I will schedule a recurring MeetUp for the first and third Monday of each month beginning with February 15th, 2016. I will also schedule a bonus MeetUp for the fifth Monday of those months that have five Mondays. This means our first four meetings will be February 15th &amp; 29th and March 7th &amp; 21st.<\/p> <p>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game.<\/p> <p>Each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers.

As data flows throughout every sector of our global economy, questions emerge from commercial, government, and non-profit organizations interested in the vast possibilities of this information. What is Big Data? How does it create value? How can we as digital consumers and producers personally benefit? While Big Data has the potential to transform how we live and work, others see it as an intrusion of their privacy.

With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, and an enduring masterpiece.<\/p> <p>At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small-town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Brilliantly attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated--and, through Mick Kelly, to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Book Details:<\/b><br\/>Paperback: 368

Il forme avec Renato un vieux couple homosexuel. Ce dernier a eu auparavant un fils, Laurent, qui lui annonce son futur mariage avec la fille d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9. La rencontre avec cet homme politique tr\u00e8s conservateur s'av\u00e8re in\u00e9vitable...<br\/>Michel Serrault obtint le <b>C\u00e9sar (equivalent to Oscar)<\/b> du meilleur acteur en 1979. Le film a remport\u00e9 le <b>Golden Globe du meilleur film \u00e9tranger <\/b>en 1980.<\/p> <p>Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) and Albin (Michel Serrault) are happy that their son, Laurent (R\u00e9mi Laurent), is getting married. Unfortunately, the bride's father (Michel Galabru) is a die-hard conservative -- and Renato and Albin are rather conspicuously gay. To ensure that the marriage goes off without a hitch, Albin uses his skills as a drag performer to play mom for a meeting with the in-laws. But, before long, both men learn that playing it straight isn't as easy as it seems!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-Valley-French-Language-Culture-Meetup\/events\/228549789\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"CLUB CINEMA FRANCAIS !","id":"228549789","time":1457395200000,"updated":1457446603000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1244058209000,"name":"Hudson Valley French Language & Culture Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1466221,"urlname":"Hudson-Valley-French-Language-Culture-Meetup","group_lat":41.0999984741,"who":"Francophones & Francophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07016","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cranford","address_1":"220 Walnut Avenue ","lon":-74.304308,"phone":"908.709.7272 and 908-709-7283   ","name":"Cranford Community Center","id":889483,"state":"NJ","lat":40.651605,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.8488368988,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451857667000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RahwayRiverTroutUnlimited\/events\/227810959\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"FLY TYING MARCH 7","id":"227810959","time":1457395200000,"updated":1457407661000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1345084805000,"name":"Rahway River Trout Unlimited","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":4560032,"urlname":"RahwayRiverTroutUnlimited","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"West Nyack","address_1":"4662 Palisades Center Dr","name":"Lucky Strike Lanes","lon":-73.955124,"id":20423322,"lat":41.096432,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.0541706085,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450593542000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey guys!

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

With its many mix\u00adand\u00admatch possibilities \u2014 a raw bar, small plates, seasonal specials, entrees and sides \u2014 the menu is designed to satisfy all appetites and wallets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bobby Will, the restaurant\u2019s creative executive chef, has pulled together unexpected yet harmonious flavors, and his culinary ideas are nowhere better presented than in the witty desserts: bitter, silken dark chocolate cr\u00e9meux is soothed and enhanced by salted mascarpone, sweet golden raisins and (surprise!) a heady basil gel\u037e chunky caramel\u00adapple compote and brown butter crumbs that adorn a dome of pumpkin\u00adspiced, evanescent cheesecake\u037e and a cup of heavenly cappuccino whipped cream alongside miniature sandwiches (the ice cream kind). You get the idea.<\/p> <p>From the raw bar, eight to 12 oysters are offered. Currently , they are mostly from the cold waters of the East Coast \u2014 Glidden Points, Fishers Islands, Beau Soleils, Moonstones, the infamous Maine Belons \u2014 and full of the salt\u00adsweet personality developed from their terroir. Take your time, note the shell, chew to release more flavors, wait for the aftertaste. A number of interesting sauces are available, but they could overwhelm the oyster\u2019s clarity. We take ours neat, the exception being Maine Belons, said to need lemon to counter their intense funkiness. Clams are also on board, and diners interested in sharing should check out the seafood \u201ctowers,\u201d which also include lobster, shrimp, oysters, mussels and crab claws.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Saltaire has even more to offer in small plates. Just when you thought there were no new flavors under the sun, charred octopus arrives wafting the cardamom and nutmeg of ras el hanout. Mussels are scented with fennel and tarragon, and, even better, Maine steamers (plenty for sharing) are bathed in a delicious, drinkable broth of celery and leek. Roasted pork belly mingled with cider\u00adbraised cabbage, pickled cauliflower and tangy mustard could have made a light supper\u037e and a dollop of fig chutney awakened a soup of celery root and apple.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Entrees, listed under both seasonal specials and Top of the Catch, seemed to overlap. The seared or grilled fish on the latter allow diners to choose a sauce and two sides. But this chef has such a knack for making old flavors new and exciting that we wished that all entrees came with garnishes already in place, like the bargains from the specials menu. Those included thick butterpoached hake with a zucchini and barley salad, tomato pesto and an unlikely but brilliant lick of creamy truffle ricotta, as well as the gently seared yellowfin\u00a0tuna with a zingy olive tapenade, sunchokes and roasted carrots on the side. Five big, juicy shrimp came from Top of the Catch, and nothing was amiss with our pick of a roasted squash medley and a brown rice pilaf, or with wild king salmon, but we couldn\u2019t help wondering what garnishes Mr. Wills would have chosen.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please find us at the Bar","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/diningout-219\/events\/229154832\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Let's go to SaltAire for Dinner in Port Chester for HVRW!","id":"229154832","time":1457395200000,"updated":1457407912000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1129506815000,"name":"Cheap Eats and other foodie delights of Westchester","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":211795,"urlname":"diningout-219","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Cheap Eats and Foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"289 Bleecker Street","name":"Pagani","lon":-74.003288,"id":15936232,"state":"Ne","lat":40.732155,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.41878283024,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456439100000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Back By Popular Demand: \u00a0We are headed to\u00a0<\/b><b>Veganized Pagani!<\/b><\/p> <p>This italian hotspot LOVED having a restaurant full of vegans and wants to have us back again...and again...and again...(They want to do this EVERY month!)\u00a0<\/p> <p>We worked hands on with the\u00a0kitchen for 3 weeks to teach the staff how to turn their menu 100% vegan and the first event got rave reviews.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

The sounds and vibrations of the gong create deep relaxation and state of meditation by altering brain waves from a Beta (waking state) to Theta &amp; Delta (deep meditation). Science teaches that during these brain frequencies we access our deeper subconscious and superconscious and they are key states for healing.<br\/>Many people have noticeable experiences during a Gong Bath.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.
