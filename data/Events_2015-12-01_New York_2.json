It\u2019s super social; just lower the volume or take the headphones off and talk to that girl or guy. There\u2019s no loud music that you have to talk over. Plus, there\u2019s no ringing in your ears when you leave.

I work for ECPAT-USA (an international anti-trafficking organization) and we are launching this trip in partnership with Altruvistas, a socially responsible tour operator whose main focus on traveling sustainably. We'll go on cultural excursions and see temples too of course, along with cuisine exploring. Travelers will get to meet with NGOs and organizations that provide trainings to prevent human trafficking, advance legislative reform, and promote children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights. We'll also get to see the amazing work being done on the ground to combat this human rights abuse, hopefully all leaving enlightened and inspired. Your journey supports these initiatives and helps ensure that children are protected. We are really excited about this upcoming trip and to take a group of travellers with us on this advocacy journey.

We will start at the N.J. Transit Station in Cranford and finish at the N.J. Transit Station in Somerville (Somerset County). This walk through central New Jersey will closely parallel the \"Raritan Valley\" Line, which has weekend service from Penn Station in Newark. Walk the entire distance or return to Penn Station from any of the train stations along the way- Westfield, Fanwood, Plainfield, Dunellen, Bound Brook or Bridgewater. Eastbound trains depart hourly from most of these stations to Newark's Penn Station on weekends. For additional information and schedules, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njtransit.com\">www.njtransit.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Although most of the miles we walk will be on level, paved suburban streets and sidewalks, we will walk through a few parks along the way. There will be plenty of food and drink options along the route, but everyone should bring at least one bottle of water and a few snacks or energy bars. Comfortable walking shoes, sneakers or light hiking shoes are recommended.

Are you willing to learn construction at it's best?<\/p> <p>Imagine either driving, or just walking passed a beautiful home you helped build for someone who is less fortunate. What if the new home-owner was outside watering his or her lawn, or just waiting with his or her child for the school bus? Would you go and talk to them? I would.

This event will inspire you, take you to levels you've never been before.<\/p> <p>Through the Critical Home Repair Program (CHR) we will help with necessary repairs on homes affected by Superstorm Sandy.

THE CREDIT SENSE DIFFERENCE. CreditSense tackles the\u00a0800 pound gorilla of the credit system\u00a0by helping consumers and business professionals to achieve Tier 1 or even 800+ credit scores. CreditSense offers powerful, proven strategies to not only recover lost points due to bad credit, but to optimize our clients' credit profiles so that every piece of data measured by FICO scoring software produces the maximum number of credit score points for them. In this presentation Merrill will show you how to optimize your credit and get you on the path to a Tier 1 or even 800+ credit score.\u00a0About Credit Sense:<\/p> <p>Every credit repair company in the country does the same thing. They send a letter to the credit bureaus that says the\u00a0problem account is not yours, or not actually late. They have no proof or research behind what they say, kind of like pointing\u00a0your finger in the dark.

He presents 4 major steps of problem-solving along with specific strategies and heuristics to attempt to apply. He also reflects on the role of a teacher in helping students build problem solving skills.<\/p> <p>This session will present P\u00f3lya's work reframed for the context of computer science and proposes the 4 Steps as a conceptual model for both students and teachers to reflect on their own problem solving processes.<\/p> <p>Computer Science and computational thinking are very much about problem solving. Experienced computer scientists have an implicit toolkit of approaches they use when facing a new problem. New learners often lack that toolkit. Attendees will walk away from the workshop with an extensive set of Question Stems aligned to each of the 4 Steps that can immediately be put into practice in the classroom.<\/p> <p>Nathaniel is Regional Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tealsk12.org\/\">TEALS<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Lionel Bergeron + Alana Aaron - Engaging All Learners in Computer Science<br\/><\/b>In 2013 Code.org initiated a worldwide interest in computer programming through the Hour of Code. In an effort to continue to engage students, especially in the elementary grades, they developed Computer Science Fundamentals. The courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with \u201cunplugged\u201d activities that require no computers at all. This workshop will look at how these unplugged activities can be used to engage all learners, no matter what the age or academic level. In addition, we will explore how the curriculum\u2019s Play Lab allows students to explore their own interest and ideas through creative programming. The most important takeaways from the presentation will be that participants will be able to identify how unplugged activities can enhance computer science content, how much the play factor can impact student performance and how to approach other lessons to engage all learners.<\/p> <p>Alana is a 5th grade teacher in Washington Heights and Lionel is a Technology Coach for D75, NYC's Special Education District.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Christine Keefe + Glenn Durfee - Using Parson's Problems to Teach AP CS <\/b><br\/>Parson's Problems ask students to put code statements in the correct order to solve a problem. They are a fun and efficient way to assess student learning of higher level learning objectives. They\u00a0are \"scrambled code puzzles\", and consist of a complete sample of well-written code presented in a random order. When properly written, Parson's problems allow instructors to identify what students don't know in syntax and logic.<\/p> <p>Attendees will learn the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of using Parson's-type problems in teaching and assessing AP Computer Science. Attendees will be able to: 1) Explain how a parsons problem can be used to tease apart errors in syntax, logic, or both, and 2) Demonstrate how to tier a parsons problem to accommodate for different learners.<\/p> <p>Christine and Glenn are rockstar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tealsk12.org\/\">TEALS<\/a> volunteers.<\/p> <p><b>&gt; Gordon Smith - Not so Standard: 5-9th Grade Coding Standards <\/b><br\/>As the CSTA begins their comprehensive review and revision of their K-12 CS Standards, we thought it was a good time to have a discussion about teaching CS in 5th to 9th grade.<br\/>Our vision is for standards that are specific enough to assess the efficacy of CS teaching and curriculum, yet at the same time broad enough to encompass coding, physical computing, and robotics. Well constructed standards will help ensure that we, as CS educators, are working towards common goals and have a framework for ensuring that we are preparing students for high school, college, career, and life-long learning opportunities in CS.<\/p> <p>We will discuss the existing CSTA standards and the standards we are developing to guide our curriculum at Codesters. We will also facilitate an open discussion among participants to help broaden and deepen a common set of standards and how to use standards to guide teaching pedagogy and assessment. The participant discussion will focus on how to make appropriate grade-level standards that prepare students for high school level standards (i.e. APCSP) and beyond. We will also discuss the purpose of CS education and how that defines what success means for students. Participants will also learn what standards are currently being used in middle grades and gain insight on selecting standards for their classroom. Attendees will also have the opportunity to share their own expertise about what belongs in a comprehensive set of standards for CS in the middle grades.<\/p> <p>Gordon is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codesters.com\/\">Codesters<\/a>.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CSNYC-Education-Meetup\/events\/225901979\/","yes_rsvp_count":72,"duration":16200000,"name":"CS Pedagogy Meetup - Nov 2015 Edition","id":"225901979","time":1446906600000,"updated":1446932364000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1382060425000,"name":"CSNYC Education Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10736002,"urlname":"CSNYC-Education-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"CS Folk"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"River Edge","address_1":"18 Lakeview Street","name":"Soul Practice Yoga hOMe Studio ","lon":-74.04024,"id":23902547,"lat":40.912518,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.555521965,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445972697000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bringing our Saturday outdoor yoga practice in.

Standing in the center of the new York City but it`s neighborhood is pretty quiet and not crowded. Here, every room is has unique interior.\u00a0 Waldorf \u2013Astoria was the first hotel that offered room service and kids menu. These two options changed the hotel industry forever. Surprisingly, there is a hidden train stop underneath the Waldoft-Astoria. President Franklin Roosevelt used it for visits from Washington DC to New York City. Also there is an elevator constructed specially for Roosevelt`s bulletproof car, connecting the train and the garage. This space was used only once since then. Andy Warhol made his own video art exhibition in 1965.<\/p> <p>Presidential rooms have unique amenities like multiple adjacent rooms for staff, bulletproof glass windows, and an interior design similar to the White House make this grand accommodation high up on the 35th floor the number one choice of sitting presidents when they visit New York.\u00a0Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed here, including President Obama, who sleeps here every time he\u2019s in town. Each president has also left the hotel a gift that is now featured in the suite (JFK left a rocking chair), so check back in a couple years to see what Obama leaves. Recently the hotel was bought by Chinese company. Fearing of espionage, current president, Barack Obama, did not stop in Waldorf Astoria this year, visiting New York City.<\/p> <p>There were filmed such movies as Weekend at the Waldorf\u00a0, Scent of a Woman, Coming to America.<\/p> <p>There are several residential units in the hotel, located on the 28th\u00a0to 42nd\u00a0floors known as the Waldorf Towers. These are some of New York\u2019s most desired homes, the smallest coming it at 1,600 square feet and many with a private terrace. All include 24-hour maid service, a private entrance and sky high price tags\u2014some of these rent for upwards of $100,000 per month.<\/p> <p>Many famous entertainers played here, including Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and Count Basie, as the city\u2019s elite dined on gourmet food and hit the dance floor for a spin. For 16 years the house band was led by Rumba King Xavier Cugat, a popular Latin music conductor who earned his chops in Cuba. There was even a terrace for summer dining with a city view. The retractable roof is long gone, but the Starlight Room is still available to host special events. Just this year, there was a gala honoring the memory of British singer Amy Winehouse with entertainment by Tony Bennett, Harry Belafonte and Jennifer Hudson.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In front of the building at 10:15","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Travel-Leisure\/events\/226073925\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":48600000,"name":"Waldorf Astoria Hotel Tour+ Lunch at Peacock Alley Restaurant","id":"226073925","time":1446909300000,"updated":1446959674000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1439071753000,"name":"Travel + Leisure","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18814226,"urlname":"Travel-Leisure","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":4.2847738266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":15,"created":1445105700000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Game starts at 10:15am sharp, so please arrive on or before 10:10am.<\/p> <p>Email me with questions.<\/p> <p>**Sign up opens on Wednesday night at 8pm, so be quick on the trigger**<\/p> <p>There are some little kids that use the field before us, so don't be scared when you see them on arrival.<\/p> <p>Turf shoes if you have em<\/p> <p>Light &amp; dark shirts<\/p> <p>Great attitude.<\/p> <p>Cheers<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BklynPickupSoccer\/events\/226344980\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":6300000,"name":"Saturday Morning Pick-Up Bedstuy 10 AM","id":"fqvnllytpbkb","time":1446909300000,"updated":1446917335000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1241024348000,"name":"Brooklyn Pickup Soccer Group","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1446129,"urlname":"BklynPickupSoccer","group_lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425500916000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This will be posted everyother weekend to remind.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Lunches,<\/b> we can use 5-10 volunteers from 9:30am-2:30pm on weekdays<\/p> <p>\u00a0and 5-10 volunteers from 10:30am-2:30pm on weekends<\/p> <p>\u00a0for food preparation, sorting\/organizing incoming food and clothing donations, meal setup, serving one lunch meal and general cleaning projects.<\/p> <p><b>Dinner<\/b> service can only use 5-8 volunteers from 4:30-7:30pm on weekdays and 5-8 volunteers from 4:30pm-7:30pm on weekends - one meal \/ clean up<\/p> <p>\u00a0Volunteers must be over the age of 15.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we offer the opportunity for corporate groups to donate the operational price of one meal\u2014around $500.

This is a shorter, easier version of the skate I led last year. Last year, we did about 17 miles with lots of hill climb. This year, we're going to do 12.5 miles with an optional bonus 1.5, totalling 14. And we're riding an elevator to eliminate much of the hill climb.<\/p> <p>The general plan:<\/p> <p>* Meet at the waterfront<br\/>* Get a quick tour of Downtown Jersey City<br\/>* Ride an elevator<br\/>* See breathtaking views from the Heights and Weehawken<br\/>* Ride down a big, moderate hill<br\/>* Cruise home on the waterfront<br\/>* Eat tacos in the open air<\/p> <p>Optional segment, for advanced skaters \/ thrill seekers:<\/p> <p>* Ride a different elevator<br\/>* Ride down a big, terrifying hill<\/p> <p>It's going to be a blast! I can't wait to see you there.<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------<br\/>What to Expect<br\/>------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Sights? Stunning Manhattan skyline views from The Heights, a whirlwind tour of Jersey City (the good, the bad, the ugly), and a nice cruise along the Hoboken waterfront.<\/p> <p>How long? 12.5 mile loop with 1.5 optional loop for Hill-of-Death<\/p> <p>Pace? Approx 2.5 hours. Meeting point? Paulus Hook Ferry Terminal<\/p> <p>Time?<br\/>Meeting time: 10:30AM<br\/>Skates on at: 10:45AM<br\/>Briefing at: 10:55AM<br\/>Rolling at: 11AM Lunch at: Approx 1:30PM<\/p> <p>Food? Some of the best fresh-mex tacos around. Hills? There's one big hill climb and one big, safe, gradual downhill.<\/p> <p>Difficulty? This is a high-intermediate skate. A hair tougher than the average WNS, but way easier than a TNS. You MUST be able to confidently skate steep downhills and uphills, in a group, with traffic, and mount\/dismount curbs as necessary. In some neighborhoods, locals may give us the stink eye. You must not break stride as you smile and\/or give the stink eye in return.<\/p> <p>Road conditions? Moderate. I'll scout the route for rough pavement and make adjustments. We may be able to keep it smooth most of the way.<\/p> <p>Rests \/ water breaks? There are several short rests along the route. Water breaks: I've planned to stop at mile 6 and mile 12 to buy water. We can add another water stop if necessary. There's a bathroom at mile 14.<\/p> <p>Bail-out? The route has two bail-out opportunities:<\/p> <p>Mile 3: 2nd St Light Rail Station, Hoboken<br\/>Mile 10: Hoboken PATH Train<\/p> <p>We'll be skating right by these locations, so it's NO problem if we need to let you off and meet you at the restaurant!

You can use a stored-value Metrocard but NOT an unlimited Metrocard.<\/p> <p>--------------------<br\/>By Car<br\/>--------------------<br\/>Parking on Sundays is widely available, especially since we are meeting in the business district.

In our culture we are strongly conditioned to frame virtue in moralistic terms of good and evil; but interestingly, and importantly, Buddhism doesn\u2019t use those distinctions in defining virtue.\u00a0 Instead, it speaks to the process where our intentions and\u00a0actions are seen as\u00a0skillful or unskillful in terms of the positive states they create or the\u00a0suffering they cause\u00a0for others or ourselves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>When we take this more expansive, less judgmental\u00a0process\u00a0view and remember that\u00a0we are\u00a0responsible for our own actions,\u00a0we can access and open to our natural\u00a0courage and curiosity about experiences.\u00a0We can use any positive or negative outcomes\u00a0as instructive and refine our course instead of getting stuck in negative states such as guilt or remorse.\u00a0We find more freedom from suffering when we are living wisely and acting skillfully and in sync with how things really are.<\/p> <p><br\/>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

Lenny reveals his plan for 'jumpstarting' his new life: smoking the marijuana he has smuggled back from Colorado. Initially appalled, Curly finally agrees to Lenny's plan, and promises to visit a Head Shop in the morning to purchase items for smoking the weed. The next day, before entering the shop, Lenny reveals that he has made a list of items he wants to buy. Curly is surprised at the extent of the list.... and of Lenny's knowledge! They enter the shop and are greeted by a man named Dusty, who initially thinks they are undercover policemen. Lenny begins to get comfortable with Dusty, but Curly thinks he should not reveal too much about his plan. Curly leaves after Lenny tells him to 'lighten up'. Dusty (his friends call him Zombie), is impressed with Lenny's list, but tantalizes him with talk of showing him some 'new stuff'. They agree that Zombie will bring everything to Lenny's house later that evening. Zombie arrives, and instead of bringing the paraphernalia, he robs them at gunpoint, ties them up and gags them. They manage to remove the gags and call Curly's sister Diane. Diane arrives with her 'friend' Jennifer and they begin to cut the two loose. Lenny is smitten with Jennifer, who helps get a party started after releasing Lenny. After a raucous impromptu party, Lenny and Jennifer become friendlier, and she asks him if he is 'real disappointed ' about losing the drugs. He states that he is not, and that he has devised a new plan: A road trip to Vegas. Jennifer wants to go, but the other are reluctant. They are soon convinced that they should go too. Lenny proclaims that this is where his new life will begin, and they all toast to their big adventure.<\/p> <p><b>Acoustic Space<\/b><\/p> <p>'Acoustic Space' is a short film about how technology has changed the way we communicate. What Marshall McLuhan once described as a 'global village,' has become a society, if not a world, of people erroneously believing technology is bringing them closer together when in fact it is driving them further and further apart. The film addresses this issue in a funny and satiric way by showing a couple having dinner in an elegant restaurant while all attempts at conversation are constantly interrupted by their ringing cell phones.<\/p> <p><b>HOW TO BUY?<\/b> Tickets are available online:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/program-26-tickets-18713951934<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Theater 3","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Filmmakers-Networkings-Screenings-and-Happy-Hours\/events\/226474641\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Big Apple Film Festival - Short Comedy Screenings","id":"226474641","time":1446918300000,"updated":1446930994000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1439168207000,"name":"New York Filmmakers Networking, Screening and Happy Hour","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18817303,"urlname":"New-York-Filmmakers-Networkings-Screenings-and-Happy-Hours","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Filmmakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10031","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"135TH STREET AND AMSTERDAM AVENUE","name":"ANNUNCIATION PARK ","lon":-73.952225,"id":8366122,"state":"NY","lat":40.818958,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":5.16854333878,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1445657349000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Please be there 15 minutes earlier so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click here for our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Game style and Rules:<\/p> <p>1.

But what if we\u2019re all self-deluded and we just don\u2019t know it? (Or maybe we\u2019re self-deluded about how well we can assess our self-delusions!) Well, for one night, we will deliberate, discuss, debate, and challenge each other to consider these and other related considerations about self-delusion. In particular, we will explore the ways in we (unknowingly) deceive ourselves, some cognitive and emotional reasons why we do this, and possible ways we can counteract these tendencies. Some of the questions we will consider include, but are not limited to:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00b7 Why do people believe weird things?<\/p> <p>\u00b7 How can our prior knowledge both help and hinder our perceptions and interpretations of new experiences? \u00b7 How is it possible that the same cognitive processes\u2014such as drawing inferences and making conclusions, synthesizing information from various sources, and analyzing and evaluating information\u2014lead us to both \u201caccurate\u201d and \u201creliable\u201d knowledge and also misunderstandings and misconceptions? \u00b7 Is it possible to know when and how we are deceiving ourselves? Is it even possible for us to see ourselves more clearly?<\/p> <p>\u00b7 What counteractive strategies might help us to see ourselves, others, and the world around us more accurately and reliably?<\/p> <p>Structure of the Discussion:<\/p> <p>We will start by defining and establishing what self-delusion means and what examples of it could be. (It would be great if you could bring some real-life examples of people who you think have deluded themselves, or, even better, personal examples!)<\/p> <p>We will then discuss why and how people delude themselves.<\/p> <p>We will consider whether and how we can counteract these cognitive tendencies.<\/p> <p>We will reflect on the implications and applications of our discussion for our lives and the lives of those around us. We will make conscientious efforts and an official commitment to delude ourselves less and less everyday! About the Moderator:<\/p> <p>Rolando is an educator of educators.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

But if you want my advice, just enjoy your extreme bargain $4.50 masala dosa. There is also a nice sized menu of all types of South Indian vegetarian food as well: idlis, vadas, bisibelebath, soups, rice, etc.\u00a0 The best bargain, in terms of what you pay here vs. what you pay anywhere else, is the dosas. <b>The food here is 100% vegetarian but not all vegan.

She has been studying the biological mechanisms of long-term memory for the last 20 years. Her studies explore the biological mechanisms of memory consolidation and reconsolidation, the processes by which newly learned information become long-lasting memories, and how memories are modulated and integrated into complex behavioral manifestations. Her studies also aim at utilizing the basic understandings of the mechanisms of memory formation to enhance memories and prevent forgetting, or disrupt pathogenic memories. Both approaches have important translational applications.<\/p> <p>She graduated from the University of Pavia in Italy with Honors and obtained a Doctorate in Research in Immunological Sciences from the University of Genoa in Italy. She trained as a post-doctoral fellow at Columbia University, studying the role of gene expression regulation during long-term synaptic plasticity consolidation in Aplysia californica.

Each month a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed and debated. This group, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Freemasons.<\/p> <p><b>Study Topic<\/b><br\/>November's topic will be conducted by Brother Plinio Butten on a study of Freemasonry: Can reality be understood for what it is without being affected by individual perception? After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.<\/p> <p>Reality is a fluid concept and what we see as real is just a perception based on our beliefs and personality. The world we see is a reflection of who we are. Can reality be understood without being transformed into what we think it should be? is perception more important than reality? Is reality connected to perception and cannot be understood without being transformed into what we think it is? Freemasonry teaches the importance of being open to change and with that the opportunity to change our reality.<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education. We further embrace the concept of a community environment, where ideas can be shared and debated in an open forum. From the seven liberal arts to the arcane, we seek to gain and to share the knowledge that is the legacy of mankind.<\/p> <p><b>More Resources<\/b><br\/>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Facebook:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Learn more about Freemasonry: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City\/events\/225959257\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Can reality be understood without being affected by individual perception?","id":"225959257","time":1446924600000,"updated":1446936840000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1378747138000,"name":"Freemasonry for Men and Women in New York City","group_lon":-73.8099975586,"id":10179932,"urlname":"Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":19,"headcount":0,"distance":19.0303649902,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445928557000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Brought to you by EntertainmentWorldHD:<\/p> <p><b>\"Simply Elegant Fall Fashion Show\" - NYC - Free Admission\"<\/b><\/p> <p>Some of you may know my work with media company EntertainmentWorldHD (IG - <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/entertainmentworldhd\">@entertainmentworldhd<\/a>) and their monthly location shoots in NYC and for the month of November they are hosting a fall fashion show with over 12 models so far.

In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee).

Every musical and dramatic work takes its audience on a journey, generally consisting of the following elements:<\/p> <p>1-) Introduction and elaboration: The central melodic theme is introduced and often repeated, in identical fashion or with variation. The mood of the piece is presented and established via use of dynamics, tempo and melodic arc.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> draw in the audience at this point, either with a compelling narrative subtext, or strong emotional message. Also, the performer must build gradual tension (when applicable), leading the audience to the musical <i>climax<\/i>.<\/p> <p>2-) Climax: The highest emotional point of the work, usually occurring 2\/3 to \u00be into the piece. Requires maximum expression and melodic emphasis to evoke a desired reaction or response from the audience. Also considered a reward point, or tension release for the audience.<\/p> <p><i>The performer should<\/i> fully understand the climactic point of the piece, and clearly highlight this point via the use of tone, dynamic expression and musical touch. The importance of the climax for audience understanding and satisfaction cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>3-) Resolution: The conclusion of the piece, during which all unresolved musical elements are resolved in a decisive manner.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> prepare the audience for the eventual end of the musical journey, a return to reality. Musical cues which aid this transition include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 gradual decrescendo and diminuendo<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 a clear a decisive \u00a0end point , so as to not leave the audience with an uneasy feeling of something unresolved<\/p> <p>Entertain your audience: Great entertainers (actors, singers, etc.) put their unique personality into every performance. If you want to make a memorable impression upon your audience, introduce a new, unique perspective on your piece. Once you truly own your piece, it should carry the inimitable stamp of your personality, but also <i>sound as if it is being performed for the first time<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Select pieces that are personally meaningful to you, and allow for your maximum expression as both performer and entertainer.<\/p> <p>Performances do not have to be memorized, or note-perfect. However, as a courtesy to your audience, please present a work that you have studied attentively, and can play to its completion.<\/p> <p>If you make a mistake during your performance, <i>please continue to play without stopping<\/i>. Apologizing, repeating a previously played section, or stopping will only call more attention to your mistake.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"website: www.nycclassical.com, email: acma@nycclassical.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/classical-139\/events\/226020851\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"ACMA November 2015 Concert","id":"226020851","time":1446930000000,"updated":1446938290000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202513261000,"name":"Amateur Classical Musicians Association","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1001619,"urlname":"classical-139","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Classical Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":10,"distance":0.868552923203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1446345236000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1202182087\/time-totalk-find-your-conversation\">*Check out CNY's first Kickstarter Campaign!<\/a><\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>This conversation is structured around the questions and answers in Pat Love, Ph.D. and Jon Carlson, Ph.D.'s TV Series \"LOVE: \u00a0What Everyone Need to Know\" shown CUNY TV every Tuesday at 10PM, TV Channel 25-3. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuny.tv\/show\/love\/PR1010105\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuny.tv\/show\/love\/PR1010105\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cuny.tv\/show\/love\/PR1010105<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Bring your questions and your collective wisdom.

This telecourse is taught by two distinguished doctors: Dr. Pat Love, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and relationship consultant, and Dr. Jon Carlson, a university professor and Psychologist. Both instructors are practicing clinicians and have authored books and articles that have attracted national recognition. They challenge students to confront assumptions on the nature of love and to critically analyze the ideals perpetuated by popular culture in order to realize the wisdom it takes to find lasting love.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/c\/f\/600_434053775.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/0\/c\/600_434053836.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/c\/7\/600_434053511.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/e\/a\/600_435681738.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/2\/d\/600_434219693.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Suggestions:<\/b><\/p> <p>A.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

They are hypoallergenic, antimicrobial and just beautiful. Great for everyone, but particularly helpful to those with allergies, asthma, night sweats and skin conditions.<\/p> <p>I am also excited that my VP of Business Development and Life Coach, Randi Farina will be presenting to us about the LFC products and opportunity.\u00a0Randi will also be presenting on The Importance of Goal Setting, and also What Holds People Back from Living the Lives of Their Dreams. She will be available for mini- individual consults on\u00a0this topic!<\/p> <p>I spent three days with Randi at an amazing LFC conference in Fort Lauderdale recently. I was incredibly impressed with her as a person (most important) and as a business woman. The one thing (of many) that left a lasting impression on me was the fact that Randi did a whole Powerpoint presentation \u00a0on\u00a0The Importance of Being Vulnerable. She is beautiful, charasmatic, very skilled, and most importantly, very authentic.<\/p> <p>Healthy drinks and refreshments served.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\nI look forward to a beautiful evening with you on Saturday, November 7th.

It is the barrier between our ordinary and mundane world and an anticipated event of the virtual world of theatre. At the same time it divides the space with a passive position of the viewer from the space of the stage where the artistic process takes place. The curtain conceals, divides and determines the space. In many instances we perceive it as a two-dimensional blind that obstructs vision, not different from a sleepy screen of a computer or closed eyes.<\/p> <p>Contemporary artists, just like their performative activities, often oscillate on the borderline between the mundane world around them and an artificially determined field of creative process. One of many possible ways how to define this is to use a medium of video. Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 uses video especially in this sense. In many of her works, like in the presented one, the video frame reflects the space of artist`s passive presence confronted with a given environment, rather than a theatre stage for an active performance.<\/p> <p>Here an analogy between the theatre space and artist`s activities is fully expressed by the author. The particular videos capture the artists performing on the proscenium of various theatres. She stands exactly on the imaginary borderline where the stage curtain opens or closes or is lowered and raised. The artist is in a literal physical contact with the curtain in these situations. A minimalist straightforwardness of the performance itself is contrasted by pathos of theatre environment. Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 might at first glance present her body as an object, but standing on the borderline of the stage and auditorium proves how important the value of own experience is to her.<\/p> <p>The stage curtain is a three-dimensional actor as well as a spatial object. Simultaneously, it serves as a metaphor for a relationship between an artist and reality, where the intersection between the ordinary and the imagination becomes the matter of physicality.<\/p> <p>Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 (born 1979 in Lu\u010denec, Slovakia ) lives and works in Prague, Czech Republic.

And some of them have stuck around. The pub is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former Confederate soldier who died there after being stabbed to death in a fight shortly after the Civil War. He frequently removes books from the bookshelf of the second floor party room and the bathtub he was said to have died in remains.<\/p> <p>Another frequent ghost siting is that of a 19th century Irish girl who died of cholera or typhoid fever.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226484912\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpblb","time":1446991200000,"updated":1447003654000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1405265504000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This unlikely slice of city street is closed to traffic every weekend when dozens of vendors unfold their tables full of goods.

Or maybe you have a student who has been absent and is trying to catch up? Or maybe you want to encourage a student to \u201ctake it to the next level\u201d. You could spend hours vetting sites. During the second part of this workshop,\u00a0teachers\u00a0are encouraged to be prepared to share some of the resources they have discovered and have found useful (including any accompanying worksheets for a particular movie\/animation\/lab).\u00a0Through the workshop, you will learn strategies to make your students active participants in the learning process and gain a list of resources vetted by your colleagues.<\/p> <p>WHO SHOULD COME TO THIS WORKSHOP?<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0Anyone interested in learning about how to\u00a0use whiteboards to engage students in the learning process as well as those interested in gaining and sharing teaching resources.<\/p> <p><b>Please Buy Your Ticket ($15) at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/qe8f69r\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/qe8f69r<\/a><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet in Zankel Hall at  TEACHERS COLLEGE, 525 West 120th St. (#1 to W 116, or M4, M5, M11, M60, or M104 to W 120 St.)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/STEMteachersNYC\/events\/226394905\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"2 Part Workshop: \"Whiteboarding as a Verb\" and \"Expanding Your Resource Bank\"","id":"226394905","time":1446994800000,"updated":1447111673000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1385002971000,"name":"STEMteachersNYC","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":11190242,"urlname":"STEMteachersNYC","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"STEMteachersNYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Flushing","address_1":"25-33 154th St","name":"North Church Queens","lon":-73.809616,"id":19135622,"state":"NY","lat":40.774464,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":120,"headcount":0,"distance":9.6097946167,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1407689232000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>service at North Church Queens starts at 10 am and goes till 11 am. then there is fellowship which i like to call snacks and a low key party. the gardens are beautiful to visit. the bible is read by someone in the congregation. passages are the same for many of the churches regardless of the denomination- some set calendar thing that many Christian Churches go by. we sing some songs which is fun cause our organist really rocks! then there is the sermon which are most often, very interesting. we say some prayers, get forgiven for our sins~ as we forgive others who sin against us. communion is every first sunday. it is bread and grape juice in those individual small plastic shot glass type things.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spirituality-Exercise-Peace-The-Arts-North-Church-Queens\/events\/226486237\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":3600000,"name":"Go to Church!","id":"qmqqhkytpblb","time":1446994800000,"updated":1446999556000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1395579308000,"name":"Spirituality, Exercise & Peace @ North Church Queens","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":13499942,"urlname":"Spirituality-Exercise-Peace-The-Arts-North-Church-Queens","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Free Spirits"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446907758000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hike a nice 7.5 mile loop in Harriman around Island Pond, including the climb up through the Lemon Squeezer on the Appalachian Trail and\u00a0a chance to check out the old\u00a0Boston Mine!\u00a0 A fun, picturesque adventure.

Please bring cash only, No Exceptions. Drinks will be paid for separately.<\/p> <p>Turkish Kitchen is well reviewed on Yelp. Excerpts include:<\/p> <p>\"Not knowing much about Turkish cuisine, we figured we should first experiment with the Sunday brunch (currently priced at $21.95\/person) where we could try a bit of everything...and what do you know, we absolutely loved the food!<\/p> <p>\n\nBRUNCH: The entire meal was gratifying. There were three tables of pastries, fresh vegetables, mixed salads, humus\/yogurt dips, dolmas, olives, seafood, beef, chicken, fruits, desserts (see pic)...and we had a bite of almost every item! Everything was tasty, had fresh ingredients and was bursting with all kinds of spices and herbs...and of course, lots of olive oil! Some of the flavors were a little strong for my palate, but regardless, I was impressed with the diversity. The desserts (rice pudding, fruit cocktail, flan, baklava, etc) were amazing...all sinfully rich and sweet.<\/p> <p>\n\nAMBIANCE: Very cool...with RED everywhere. There's a large bar on the first floor; therefore, naturally, the second floor dining room is quieter and more reserved.<\/p> <p>\n\nSERVICE: Everyone was generally polite. (We might've have the same server that Deborah H. had, because he was awfully playful!)<\/p> <p>\n\nSUM: Thanks, Turkish Kitchen, for a wonderful introduction to Turkish cuisine.\"<\/p> <p>\"Wow, where do I start...When a Turkish friend whose judgement you trust invites you to brunch over the bridge in Manhattan, you go. Because Turkish food rocks when it is made right and this is the guy who introduced me to Taci's in Brooklyn, I had high expectations.<\/p> <p>\n\nAs good as I hoped the buffet would be, it was even better, \u00a0In fact there were so many delicious choices, it was hard to narrow down what to put on my plate during each visit back to the buffet! Round one: Turkish bread and croissants, smoked salmon, cheeses, salads, olives, yogurt, mashed eggplant, humous, \u00a0homemade stuffed grape leaves, cheese borek, orange juice, coffee....Round two, ground lamb, lamb gyro, chicken shish kebab and more humous. There was also talapia for the fish eaters and rice which I opted not to fill up on. And then came round three. I tried to be good, I really did. I took some fruit and mellon but the baklava and five or six other Turkish pastries looked so lonely, so I knew in my heart that I just had to find them a home in my stomach! \u00a0And of course more coffee...but you can also get tea.<\/p> <p>\n\nEverything was well prepared and spiced. Likewise the staff was friendly, professional and helpful. And Louise, the bathrooms were nicely tiled!<\/p> <p>\n\nMy only suggestions are that they find a way to serve the Turkish bread warm...difficult but not impossible with a buffet. Be careful to not overcook the chicken (mine was a tad dry) and please don't dump the extra ice in the urnal because it takes it out of commission!<\/p> <p>\n\nAt $21.95, this Sunday brunch is worth the price!\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/kFQ3z6NDyU2GfOWkc0A1Xg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/eu1x7_WbEmXqv90hgNLtbg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/v5eVjxR5woIZTlckMlVKhA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/226330542\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"Sunday Brunch at Turkish Kitchen","id":"226330542","time":1446998400000,"updated":1447088905000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

Around this era, military and tourism-related enterprises on nearby <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iona_Island_(New_York)\">Iona Island<\/a> employed residents, as did the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Palisades_Interstate_Park_Commission\">Palisades Interstate Park Commission<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Members of the first family to settle in Doodletown during the 18th century, French Huguenots whose name was anglicanized to \"June,\" were also the very last to leave it in the 1960s.<\/p> <p>Other residences were maintained as second homes or were inhabited by retired people from the New York City area, and Doodletown's population thus reached its historic peak of about 350 residents<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/1\/b\/0\/600_442208624.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>The Demise<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>In its peak in the 1920's, Doodletown had a new, larger school, the finest building in the town. There were three primary roads, a lane connecting to Seven Lakes Drive, several dead end lanes, two working cemeteries, and approximately seventy homes. Many families like the Junes, Herberts and Weyants had lived there for generations.<\/p> <p>BUT, Beginning ca 1921, and throughout the following decades, the Park began to expand its borders by slowly purchasing the settlements properties. Many of these properties were then rented out to Park employees. In 1962, the Park planned to build a ski resort where Doodletown was located. The residents were to be bought out. Some were relieved to be able to sell. At the time, homeowners were unable to secure home improvement loans, and buyers were unable to obtain mortgages, since the lenders felt that the town's demise was inevitable. Others, strongly resisted, and were threatened with condemnation through eminent domain. In early 1965, the last of the Doodletown residents had moved out. This included the June family, whose members had lived there continuously since 1762. Ironically, the ski resort was never built. The Park now owned all of the land, except for the two cemeteries. In 1966, the buildings were demolished and the debris was buried. The town was left to revert to its natural state, wild and largely overgrown.<\/p> <p>The last remaining building, the stone school house, was kept as a shelter for hikers until vandalism caused the park commission to tear it down in 1980.<\/p> <p><br\/>Today, many foundations, walls, and staircases are still visible. The area is accessible by various trails and former roadways. The town's cemeteries contain graves ranging from centuries old to much more recent years, as former residents and their relatives can still choose to be buried there. Steel signage has recently been installed by the park service, listing which families owned each property and often showing photographs of former buildings. Orientation signs are located at intervals throughout the area.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will See the, sidewalks, cellar holes, wells, walls and foundations, with photos to show how they once appeared when lived in.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Usually, we work through Julia Cameron's creativity building techniques (for example those in The Artist's Way and The Prosperous Heart). We start each session discussing the current week's activity (morning pages, artist's dates, synchronicities, creative endeavors, etc) and then participate in an agreed upon exercise\/task (bring paper and pen please).<\/p> <p><br\/>Normally, on the\u00a0third Sunday of the month, we share our artistic projects in a kind of \"Show &amp; Tell\" so that we can get to know each other's work and support it. Not mandatory - only for those who wish to share or present their work.<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a very creative and supportive small group.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/226335629\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytpblb","time":1447002000000,"updated":1447014393000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10002","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"152 Ludlow Street","address_2":"Btwn: Stanton & Rivington street","lon":-73.987898,"phone":"212-253-0036","name":"Cake Shop","id":839549,"state":"NY","lat":40.720953,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.01417946815,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428893599000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Work on your own projects and if you have questions feel free to ask them.

He is only released, after many decades, from a Djinn-bottle in the Vestibule on the outer edge to Hell when he finally calls upon God for mercy. Upon release he is met by Benito, or Benny, a Virgil-like figure whose full identity is not immediately apparent. Benito offers to take him out of Hell by bringing him to the center.<\/p> <p>At first, as Allen and Benito travel through Hell, Allen tries to scientifically rationalize everything he sees, renaming his surroundings as 'Infernoland', a high-tech amusement park some thousand years in the future. It isn't until he sees a man recover from incineration and his own leg heal from a compound fracture that he starts to actually believe that he is in Hell. From this point on, as Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell, he sees how he is guilty of each of the sins in some fashion, commenting to himself that he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (simony) only because he has never had any holy offices to sell. At first Allen views the punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime, repeatedly thinking, \"We're in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism\", although he comes to more and more to accept the justice of the situation as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that keeps many of the condemned in hell. Eventually Allen takes over Benito's role in helping reformed souls proceed onto Paradise via Purgatory, allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself. It is revealed that Benito is actually Benito Mussolini, the former dictator of Italy.<\/p> <p>Along the way Allen meets a number of his Californian acquaintances and notable people from history (e.g. Epictetus, Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bob Ford, L Ron Hubbard, Henry VIII of England, Vlad Tepes, Aimee Semple McPherson, William M. Tweed, Al Capone) and from classical mythology (e.g. Hector, Aeneas, Charon, Minos, Phlegyas, Geryon). Due to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer vestibule he also meets some people from the future of 1976, such as a space shuttle pilot.<\/p> <p><br\/>LOCATION<br\/>We will be meeting at the Citigroup Atrium.<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/1\/600_42060561.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There is an entrance at 53rd and Lexington Avenue off of the 53rd and Lex subway stop.

A highly sensitive individual has spiritual, emotional and energetic perceptions. This physical and emotional trait is inherited. One out of five Americans has the trait of sensitivity. All sensitives aren't empaths but all empaths are sensitive. In this workshop we will learn the differences between sensitivity and empathy. We will also explore some of the physical, emotional, spiritual and mental manifestations which come from being born sensitive.<\/p> <p>Can you identify with the following?<\/p> <p><br\/>Being labeled as too emotional or sensitive?<br\/>Are your feelings hurt easily?<br\/>Do you get overstimulated when under pressure?<br\/>Do you feel nervous or anxious around loud noises, weird smells or textures, and bright lights?<br\/>Do you find that you eat, drink, smoke or use recreational drugs to turn yourself off, emotionally and mentally?<\/p> <p>In this workshop we will learn how to manage our sensitivity through learning about the spiritual gift of sensitivity and empathy. We will also learn about highly sensitive people and empaths through my personal teachings and the teachings of Dr Elaine Aran, the author of the Highly Sensitive Person and Dr. Michael R. Smith the author of the Empath Connection.<\/p> <p>This workshop is being held at Aum Shanti formally known as Aum Namaste at 226 East 14 St. N.Y. N.Y. 10003.
