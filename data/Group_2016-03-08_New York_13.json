But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute. Yet paid care is out of reach for many. Please come down on November 17th to the New York Life building in Lake Success, NY and attend a free educational workshop on long term care and the many options that are available for us to avoid creating any future hardships for our family members Feel free to contact me for any further information 516-359-8696 Anyone interested in learning about long term care is welcome to join.

overlooking Central Park! This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I took a basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen. The cost per guest is will be minimum donation of $40.

Aren\u2019t you an extension of the higher power you believe in, a piece of what has made up this entire universe? As that, shouldn\u2019t you be able to mold your own universe, your own life, into whatever you choose? With as little struggle and as much fun as you would if you were placing an order and selecting what you wanted from a catalog?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yes you are, and yes you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The truth is <\/b>that the voice within you, the one that\u2019s always known and the one that\u2019s always guiding you - perhaps even to these words right now - is right. The road to whatever transformation you are in search of is an ACCELERATED one- or it can be given the right mentor and the right tools. From my heart to yours, I invite you to experience first-hand how accelerated the transformation that\u2019s been calling you can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>I decided to start this group<\/b> because as a master coach and successful entrepreneur, I notice so many people (including myself at one point in time) in what I call the \u201chamster wheel\u201d of never achieving their goals, where it seems to them that they never will or worse that their experience of getting there is such a struggle that they rob themselves from the joy of the process. It hurts me to see this as so many people's experience, just as much as it hurt me to experience it once myself... and it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The purpose of this meet up is <\/b>for you to discover and uncover what within you is truly holding you back and be given the tools on how to transform that in the most accelerated way. I'll be sharing a way for you to literally shift your existing reality to the one you desire - immediately. I'm sure you\u2019ve heard that many times before, but the difference this time is that I\u2019m not \"just saying this to you\"\u2026 I\u2019m <b>claiming<\/b> this <b>for you <\/b>and inviting you to claim this for yourself<b>.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What gives me the right<\/b> to claim that? Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve DONE with my own life and now it's what I so deeply want for yours. Earlier this year, it was my own voice within that guided me to receiving these tools from my mentor which ended up being THE biggest quantum shift of my life - I tell you, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is beating so fast with the truth that I do not even recognize myself! It is from this place that a fire within me exists to personally guide you to through your own experience of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The very tools that I was given to use for my own accelerated evolution are the very tools that you are being offered right now. I invite you to come find out what those are! Talk is cheap and your personal experience of what I\u2019m sharing with you is stronger than any of my words. Once you get to know me, you\u2019ll learn that I\u2019m not about the fluff, but rather the real \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d to arrive at the transformation you\u2019re looking for... and it's my greatest fulfillment to provide that for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Therefore, these meet-ups are FREE<\/b>\u2026 you have nothing to lose and more than you could ever imagine to gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>So, are you ready?

So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience. Workshop participants will be able to get on your feet, practice, and start to make some connections with other professionals. Post packet PDF included.

Within each of us are layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your own way. And our experts are always available to help. Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of Sahaja Yoga Meditation every day may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy (called kundalini in the yogic tradition) and light the path to lifelong transformation. Sahaja is more than a temporary solution or quick relief; it's a journey to complete fulfillment. All classes are free. Everyone is welcome. Bring a friend, bring your kids \u2014 we welcome all ages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.<\/p>\n<p>For more, visit <a>www.sahajameditation.com.<\/a> Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a not-for-profit offering free spiritual meditation guidance in more than 100 countries worldwide.<\/p>","lon":-74.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/highres_447004195.jpeg","photo_id":447004195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/600_447004195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/thumb_447004195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":195226449,"name":"Mark Taylor","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/highres_251193515.jpeg","photo_id":251193515,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/member_251193515.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/thumb_251193515.jpeg"}},"members":68,"name":"East Rutherford Sahaja Yoga Meditation","id":19098841,"state":"NJ","urlname":"East-Rutherford-Sahaja-Yoga-Meditation","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bronx","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446904199000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"seo-search-engine-optimization","name":"SEO (Search Engine Optimization)","id":23199},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Tech-Factory-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Inspired by the role technology plays in daily life, we organize devs, designers, artists, and any interested in pushing the envelope from the grassroots by meetings, office hours, events, and workshops.

No need to rush home after a day of skiing.......let's listen to some music in the lodge and relax before heading out. The goal of this group is to have meetups at local Westchester bars so we can meet other ski buddies and arrange carpools so we can all ski together. And also to have a drink or 2! If you're into hanging out at the lodge, thats cool too....no need to be a skier.

This encompasses scrabble play with clocks, challenges and no looking in the dictionary before you play a word. I have enough equipment for four players or two games. The idea of this meetup is an alternative from playing scrabble online. When people play online there is no supervision so you don't know if the game is legitimate or not. The rules: 25:00 in a standard scrabble game for each opponent. If you go over your clock a minute you are penalized ten points even if it is one second. This event will be held at the Greenhouse Cafe at 7717 3rd Ave Brooklyn NY 11209 7-10:30 pm alternate Tuesdays. Directions are the R train to 77th street and walk one block south to third avenue.

Whether you are a long time business owner or just starting out, working for yourself, can be a very lonely and sometimes a little scary. We don't always know all the right things to do and we are often afraid, ashamed or too stubborn to ask for help. By nature, we are passionate, giving, independent and creative. A community of like-minded women going for it in their lives and businesses is a force to be reckoned with. When we take out the competitive mindset and instead trust that there is success for each of us, that rising tide lifts all ships.

Our group will visit tea houses, tea events and perhaps once we get to know each other have tea sociasl at each others homes. Members' suggestions and participation is encouraged in order to keep it interesting. Although we would like to keep a non-strict, casual environment, RSVP is necessary in order to prepare accordingly. Three no-shows will result in your exclusion from the group. I am looking forward to making new friends among all the other tea lovers out there!<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/7\/b\/highres_444357467.jpeg","photo_id":444357467,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/7\/b\/600_444357467.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/7\/b\/thumb_444357467.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10513268,"name":"Roy L","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/f\/4\/highres_251394516.jpeg","photo_id":251394516,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/f\/4\/member_251394516.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/f\/4\/thumb_251394516.jpeg"}},"members":108,"name":"Men's Tea Social","id":19117921,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mens-Tea-Social","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Tea Enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447427631000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"schoolchoice","name":"School Choice","id":3176},{"urlkey":"movement","name":"Social Movements","id":10460},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"education-reform","name":"Education Reform","id":21311},{"urlkey":"changing-k-12-education","name":"Changing K-12 Education","id":157144},{"urlkey":"charter-schools","name":"charter schools","id":270451}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-School-Choice-Summit\/","rating":0,"description":"In commemoration of National School Choice Week, Choice Media and Saint Peter\u2019s University School of Education invite you to join education reform leaders and supporters from across New Jersey for a timely, important, and uplifting meeting about education reform and school choice in the Garden State.

National Women's Liberation (NWL) is a new feminist group with old roots. The organization was born from a collaboration between organizers from Redstockings and Gainesville Women's Liberation (FL) which started in 1968. We are a dynamic and diverse group of women in the fight against male supremacy, developing theory alongside our actions. An integral part of our organization is the Women of Color Caucus (WOCC) which meets separately from white women to better understand how white supremacy intersects with other forms of oppression. Our group hosts public meetings the third Tuesday of every month at The Commons at 388 Atlantic Ave, and all women are welcome. <br><\/p>\n<p>NWL won a big victory in 2013 when the Morning-After Pill was put over the counter for all ages, the fruits of a 10-year battle that included a sit-in at the FDA, illegally giving out the pill to show the ridiculousness of the restrictions, and a class action lawsuit. Current priorities are the right to abortion and birth control and the overthrow of the double day--women's roles as full-time caretakers and full time employees. Most recently, we printed and distributed 1969 \"This Oppresses Women\" stickers after reviving them from the Redstockings Archive. We got a lot of publicity when they were used against Protein World's Beach Body ads in Union Square, and they continue to appear on other offending ads all over the city. NWL feminists are also organizing the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign in NYC. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are a group for women who want to fight back against male supremacy and win more freedom for women. We believe that change comes about from the actions of everyday people\u2014not politicians, the courts, lobbyists, or the media. The freedoms we have now were won by movements of women, organizing and fighting for change. Men did not become less sexist or decide to give women the vote or legalize birth control because of our individual abilities to reason with them, educate them, or because they love us so much. The inequalities between women and men are political problems that require a collective solution.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Check out womensliberation.org to get involved. <br><\/p>\n<p>Unless specifically noted, all events are for women only.

This became apparent during our first Zmission. It was truly a humbling and eye-opening experience. As we sat together in fellowship after traveling thousands of miles, we realized that we were there to Serve in any way needed and without judgment. Guidance came in the form of wise council trusting in God and seeking his word. To feel the power of God, let go and trust in him and your life will be transformed. Jesus shows up in our lives in powerful ways and guides us along our journeys<\/p>\n<p>What We Can Do to Serve <br>There are many ways TO SERVE communities around the world and gives new found hope to people who may not have had hope before through Christ. This means bringing groups together to transform lives and opening minds to new realities by embodying the unconditional love of Jesus. It also means we are never above the communities and individuals we serve. No task is to small. We will serve around the world where there is need and you will impact the world in a positive way while making a difference in thousands of people lives along the way.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll Know What To Do When You Get There <br>Where God leads you next, and the blessings he will bestow will absolutely blow your mind.

Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>Zmissions Team <br>Jon Christian \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>God began taping me on the shoulder at an early age. I remember it like it was yesterday. I\u201dd always been naturally rebellious and found it hard to accept what was taught at Sunday school. Sound Familiar? At the age of about 7, I realized there was something missing while sitting in Church services. I felt like God had a bigger plan. A plan for me to SERVE!<\/p>\n<p>Years passed while my searched continued for connection, purpose, and impact until the day my perspective was changed forever\u2026 at my feet written as clear as the day was\u2026\u201dJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d. That was the day I was CALLED SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>I found myself standing on the farthest rock in the ocean I could find. I\u2019d been traveling for miles with 50 lbs. of gear and had not seen my family in two months. As the sun began to set the sky had lit up like fire. The contrast between the blue ocean and the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was as if God himself was staring back at me looking deep within my soul. My hair began to stand up the same way it had when I found \u201cJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d written in concrete so many years before. A voice from within, not the voice you hear from internal conversations you have in your head on a normal day, this was all encompassing vibrating energy coming from both outside and within, it was coming from my heart and the entire world around me. The words spoken to me were \u201cWELL DONE, YOU MADE IT\u2026NOW GO AND TELL THE WORLD.<\/p>\n<p>The adventures and the journey are long, hard, and sometimes painful, but also transformational, rewarding, and have brought much joy and fulfillment in my life. I continue to push my limits, praying \u201cJESUS CHRIST MY LORD AND GOD IN YOU I PUT MY TRUST\u201d Through all the chaos and adventure, and a chance meeting with my Guardian Angel who taught me what unconditional love is I had found what I had been looking for since the age of 7. These experiences have absolutely transformed my life and outlook but most importantly by putting my faith in Jesus and believing he could provide everything and more that we needed I experienced a level of living a life that many only dream about.<\/p>\n<p>Where God lead me next, and the blessings he bestowed on me to this day absolutely blow my mind. Where ever we go, what ever we do, when we get there we do what is needed Period. All you have to do is show up and the big man above will handle the rest. What will you do next? Did you feel it? Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>After a long and sometimes lonely journey, I\u2019ve found wise counsel and fellowship in Christ. Now it\u2019s your turn, we climb this mountain and embark on the adventure together.<\/p>\n<p>John Albino \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>John Albino started Absolute Music Studios with one goal in mind\u2026 to create a warm and inviting musical atmosphere that he himself would want to come to. It all started with the desire to live a more community-oriented life and to be around to raise his children instead of living on the road, which he did for many years. John has worked with musicians from many of the biggest names in the music business over the years, including KISS, The Pretenders, Wings, Billy Joel, Foreigner, Pat Travers and Quiet Riot, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>He has also worked as a studio musician, playing on sessions with many top producers including Stephen Gelfas and Charlie Midnight. <br>Now he has created a first class music studio staffed with the best player-teachers in the area. He brings decades of musical expertise and the benefit of years of front-line professional experience to Absolute Music, his own unique creation. Using that experience as a musician and a vision to guide him, he set out to build a studio where many could come and pursue their passion for music in a warm and inviting family-oriented atmosphere, while being taught by the finest teachers available. Absolute Music is now firmly established as one of the best and busiest music lesson studios in the area. John\u2019s continual dedication to and involvement with the surrounding communities plays a crucial role in his success, while also providing community enrichment through music.<\/p>","lon":-74.1800003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/highres_444267699.jpeg","photo_id":444267699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/600_444267699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/3\/3\/thumb_444267699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192504993,"name":"Jon Christian","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/highres_251458961.jpeg","photo_id":251458961,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/member_251458961.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/5\/1\/thumb_251458961.jpeg"}},"members":21,"name":"Zmissions Christian Adventure Group Hazlet, NJ","id":19129064,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Zmissions-Christian-Adventure-Missions-Meetup-Hazlet-NJ","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.4199981689,"who":"ZMission Warriors For The People"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447729458000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"happiness","name":"Happiness","id":16481},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-care","name":"Self-Care","id":27818},{"urlkey":"creating-a-healthy-relationship-to-food","name":"Creating a Healthy Relationship to Food","id":36824},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897},{"urlkey":"mindful-and-intuitive-eating","name":"Mindful and Intuitive Eating","id":118995}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nourish-Mind-and-Body\/","rating":5,"description":"This group provides a safe space to explore how yoga and mindfulness can help make a difference in your life, reduce stress, start living in the present moment and lead to better self-care. I am Diana S. Ramos, a Registered Dietitian\/Nutritionist and yoga instructor. I practice a mind-body approach to nutrition and well-being, and empower each individual to develop a healthy relationship with their bodies, mind and food. My mission is to help individuals thrive into a more joyful, healthy and mindful lives. I discovered the real benefits of yoga in the most difficult times in my life. I was at my peak levels of stress, anxiety and unhappiness. Yoga helped me find peace within myself. Through the practice of yoga I discovered that stress, anxiety and unhappiness were rooted from not living and accepting the present moment. I noticed I was either in living in the past or worrying about the future, but never present moment, in what is. Yoga helped me to kindly move into the present moment, decrease self-judgement, and cultivate self-compassion, self-love and self-acceptance. I would like to share this experience and practice with you. This group offers yoga and wellness workshops, to help you dive into the present moment, release stress and anxiety, and help you to compassionately take care of you. Allow yoga to help you connect with your body. Yoga is not about how flexible you are but how flexible you can become on your mat and in real life with you and your thoughts. Yoga is not about competing, comparing, or judging, it is about self-acceptance, self-love and self-compassion. Yoga is a practice where no experience necessary. The only requirement is you and an open mind. This is an invitation to take care of your body and mind. My Motto: Embrace. Love. Nurture. Embrace who you are. Love yourself just as you are. In order to Nurture yourself the right way.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194388034,"name":"Diana Ramos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/highres_250709693.jpeg","photo_id":250709693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/member_250709693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/thumb_250709693.jpeg"}},"members":109,"name":"Nourish Body & Mind","id":19129142,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nourish-Mind-and-Body","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Body-Mind Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447736862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"productdesign","name":"Product Design","id":2993},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"business-ideas","name":"Business Ideas","id":15928},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"ideas","name":"ideas","id":49075}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Creative-Lab\/","rating":0,"description":"The Creative Lab is a place for people to exercise their creativity.

We want to meet at least once a week, to speak of Jesus Christ and the Scriptures, to pray together, to continue in the apostles teachings and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread.\n\nIt is written, there is one who scatters, yet increases more; and there is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty. This group is to \"scatter\" the word of God, to give free course to the Scriptures. As long as we are willing to rightly divide the word of truth, every man and woman has a part in the conversation. We can edify each other in love. I put one block of truth, and you can put another block of truth.\n\nYou can expect to be part of a spiritual conversation, and the opportunity to exercise your spiritual gifts as long as we do all things decently and in order. When we come together, every single member has. One has a psalm, another a doctrine, someone else a tongue, another one a revelation, the next man an interpretation. Let all things be done for edifying of the body of Christ.\n\nThe Gospel\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God unto the meek, liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, the proclamation of the day of salvation, the acceptable year of the Lord (Isa 52:6-7, 61:1-2, Luk 4:18-19, 8:1); whereby God sent and anointed his son Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel and to be the saviour of the world. (1 Jn 4:14) The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes whether Jew or Greek (Rom 1:16-17) to all them that call upon him (Rom 10:12-15). For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  The Gospel declares that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, he was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures, that he was seen of Cephas, the twelve and then of five hundred brethren at once. (1 Cor 15:1-3) Through the Gospel we understand that that the stone which was rejected is become the head of the corner.  Jesus Christ who was rejected and crucified rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and is now exalted far above all principalities and powers (Ps 118:22-23, Mat 21:42, Acts 4:10-12, 1 Cor 15:1-3, Eph 1:20-21). This tried stone is none other than Jesus Christ; whose name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isa 7:10-14, Mat 1:21-23; Is 8:10-18, 9:6-7; 1 Pet 2:4-8). This is the true God and eternal life (1 Jn 5:20).\n\nAn essential part of the gospel is understanding what it means that Jesus is the Christ.  It is written, that He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God did not give the Spirit by measure unto Him (Jn 3:34). This verse speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, a body that God prepared, so that the fullness of the Father would be manifested in him (Heb 10:5). As the Scripture says, For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col 1:19).  This is the mystery of Christ, even the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory (1Ti 3:16). He that sees Jesus, sees Him that sent him (Jn 12:45). This is to the mind that has understanding. The name of the Father is Jesus. The name of the Son is Jesus. The name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus. These are spiritual words, and they owe to be discerned spiritually. This is what Jesus meant, when he said that he was the Son of God. For since the very beginning it was written, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness (Gen 1:16). Jesus Christ is that man, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature (Col 1:15). God was in Christ, and not another. I repeat again, Christ received the Spirit of God without measure. The prophet Isaiah foresaw this and speaking as the oracles of God wrote that a child will be born unto us, that a son will be given. And that his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father. We are also called to be partakers of such fullness, to come in the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to grow unto that perfect man, unto the measure and stature of Christ (Eph 4:13). We are also called to receive the Spirit of Christ. God will give us the Holy Ghost if we obey Him (Acts 5:32). Men and brethren, what must we do in order to obey God?\n\nJesus Christ came preaching repentance and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat 4:17). In order to enter into the kingdom of God we must be born again of the water and of the Spirit (Jn 3:3-5). Those early disciples in the book of Acts were born again when they repented, were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (born of the water), and received the infilling of the Holy Ghost (born of the Spirit). (Acts 2:37-41, 8:12-17, 9:17-18, 10:44-48, 19:1-6) The baptisms in the book of Acts were done in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 4:12, 8:12, 10:48, 19:5, Gal 3:27, Rom 6:3-4, Col 2:12). In order to obey the Gospel and enter into the kingdom of God we too must do what those early disciples did and what Jesus commanded. Repent therefore, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you too shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38-39). Please take the time to look up the scriptures listed in this study (Acts 17:11).","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/highres_445157812.jpeg","photo_id":445157812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/600_445157812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_445157812.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":182770744,"name":"Andy Rodriguez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/highres_241877221.jpeg","photo_id":241877221,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/member_241877221.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/4\/5\/thumb_241877221.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"Church In Manhattan","id":19136615,"state":"NY","urlname":"Church-In-Manhattan","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Christians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447943628000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"motion-graphics","name":"Motion Graphics","id":19344},{"urlkey":"final-cut-pro","name":"Final Cut Pro","id":19965},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"3d-animation","name":"3D Animation","id":25718},{"urlkey":"compositing","name":"Compositing","id":29130},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"vfx","name":"VFX","id":30988},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"visual-effects-cg-animation","name":"Visual Effects CG Animation","id":70655},{"urlkey":"post-production-editing-visual-effects-vfx","name":"POST-PRODUCTION: EDITING & Visual Effects VFX","id":468552},{"urlkey":"animation-and-visual-effects","name":"Animation and visual effects","id":1250832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/postproductionworkshops\/","rating":0,"description":"Live workshops and user group meetings on making workflow with FCPX, DaVinci Resolve, Fusion, Smoke and a bunch of other stuff.

Many are still scratching their heads: asking why why such an awkward silly wannabe-- sorry- excuse- for- D\/s erotica created such a stir.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Exhibit A:<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>She Said~<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dude, I would watch that show. But no joke the tone was more spastic than a herd of gerbils hopped up on crystal meth flipping from dark drama to more light-hearted comedic fare and back again (not to mention&nbsp;stalking is the new black; all the cool billionaire sadists are doing it). Even die-hard fans were laughing along with me at some of the more melodramatic fails in the film and the mother-daughter duo to my right (because nothing says family bonding than bondage porn) were less-than-blown-away saying to each other after the credits rolled \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t that bad\u201d and \u201cit kind of grew on you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still a better idea than watching&nbsp;Fifty&nbsp;Shades.Verdict <\/p>\n<p><b>He Said~<\/b><\/p>\n<p>An insufferably stupid erotic film. Any author or screenwriter at the end of their rope because they know that they\u2019ll never be good enough to be published or produced, can use Fifty Shades of Grey to know they are good enough.&nbsp;You are good enough, writer! Even if you suck, which you might if your self-esteem is that low, you can know that since something like this has been released to the masses, you have hope. And even if you do get rejected by everyone, at least you can know that your boo probably loves you. And if your relationship is even creepier than the one portrayed here, at least one of you probably has some sort of personality. And if you\u2019re single, at least you have alcohol.<\/p>\n<p><b>We think the better question is what does this global craze say about the void that exist?<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this tragic attempt at erotic art has been bashed to pieces--one thing is clear. There's a lot of curiosity about fet-alt erotica. Obviously-- vanilla erotica is limited, uninspiring or perhaps just plain boring to millions of women and even men around the world. It's sad to contemplate so many kinksters all dressed up with no place to go.

Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, take measurements of habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile.

It becomes easy to literally see your limitations and problems while also seeing powerful solutions no other tools can provide. You will enhance the best of yourself while upgrading your life in ways beyond your dreams. Join this group to start UPGRADING YOUR LIFE each week. You will have fun while making real changes in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each Session members will hold in their hands printed sheets of Art work they will use to record parts of their minds, solve problems, communicate with their minds (different from meditation), record measurements of mental activity. With the Art Work members of the community will be able to show each others what they are working on each week. Personal improvement moves form a philosophical talk to show me your Art work and what you are working on. Members will select projects and goals they will work on as individuals and within the community making possible everything form habit change, weight release, less stress, greater mental focus, solving business problems, removing fears and anxieties, becoming free from shyness, emotional clarity and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>GAIN CLARITY ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IN YOUR BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LIFE<\/p>\n<p>MAKE REAL CHANGES TO YOUR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND ACTIONS<\/p>\n<p>DISCOVER THE HIDDEN ASSETS NEEDED TO BUILD YOUR FUTURE<\/p>\n<p>TRANSFORM YOUR PAST INTO AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF NEW POSSIBILITIES<\/p>\n<p>USE YOUR EMOTIONS AS RESOURCES<\/p>\n<p>YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW TO SET AND ACHIEVE GOALS IN THE REAL WORLD<\/p>\n<p>DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS<\/p>\n<p>EACH SESSION WILL BE WILL BUILD ON THE LAST AND TAKE TO THE NEXT STEP<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105794502,"name":"James Murdock","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/highres_149903682.jpeg","photo_id":149903682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/member_149903682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/thumb_149903682.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"UPGRADE AND RESET YOUR LIFE","id":19154726,"state":"NY","urlname":"UPGRADE-AND-RESET-YOUR-LIFE","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"BRAIN-MIND SETTERS"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Flushing","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448481823000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"tantric","name":"Tantra","id":10146},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"kirtan","name":"Kirtan","id":18868},{"urlkey":"devotional-singing","name":"Devotional Singing","id":21450},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-chanting","name":"Meditation and Chanting","id":82258},{"urlkey":"ananda-marga","name":"Ananda Marga","id":89311},{"urlkey":"vegetarians-and-vegans-vegan-vegetarian-activism","name":"Vegetarians and Vegans & Vegan Vegetarian Activism","id":136597}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Flushing-Ananda-Marga-Meditation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This Meetup provides a venue and scope to experience mantra chanting, learn and practice meditation, and other yogic practices of Ananda Marga.

Events are limited to 4 photographers. Most models seem to prefer 3 photographers. Those events with more than 4 are called paparazzi shoot-outs, they typically cost less. Some events are meet and greets or promotional events.<\/p>\n<p>The models chosen to be on the team have been interviewed and have passed a series of criteria to participate. These models are professional and work well beyond the time behind the camera: They scout locations, contact venues, determine if permits are required or not and obtain them if feasible. Some events require they rent wardrobe or equipment and it doesn't need to be explained that there is a great deal of time doing all of that. This group nor the models do any TFPs... Ever. What's nice is the photographers never have to spend any time editing, copying or distributing pictures to models. That's right. Photographers are not obligated to share their pictures nor are the models expecting any from them. WorldChoiceModels is ideal for:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers that want to do street photography or photowalks with a model. \u2022 Photographers looking to practice their skills, experiment with their equipment or technique.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers looking to expand their portfolios. bridal, senior portraits, couples, fashion, commercial lifestyle, editorial, etc. From time to time there will be workshops on studio lighting, and specific genres. So keep a look out. Hopefully changing the name will attract women photographers ,which I know are many.<\/p>\n<p>This is an excellent forum to practice and build your portfolio.

We\u2019re people just like anyone else. We have families of our own. We understand that life is a gentle and tricky balance of caring for oneself as well as our loved ones. Far too often the former gets neglected and we can say that because we\u2019ve been there. We\u2019ve been down that road. Ultimately we decided it was time to make time.

Hope this message finds you and your families well! This is a group for families looking for like minded parents to do babysitting swaps\/exchanges with and virtually save on all monetary cost associated with child care. Anyone can create meetups and-or post. We have a free conference call line. This group is the resource that you need whether you are an eventful, active, career parent or a hard-working, resilient stay-at-home parent having the time to accomplish task or take time for your self to replenish so that you can be fully available for your family and career is priceless. This group is great for parents who have enough energy reserved to be available for children in addition to their own. Whether it is once a week or more that you do exchanges, this group WILL allow you to save on babysitters and expensive child care cost within a supportive network of families that also provides opportunity to nurture, love and teach each others children. We are parents ourselves and that experience alone can be so significant in having peace on who we are leaving our children with when we do exchanges. We invite all exchangers to meetup at some of the fun, free and low cost events posted in this group when exchanging. This group is founded on the principle that it takes a village to raise our children. In order to participate you mainly need to have enough energy and time reserved to care for children in addition to your own in a loving, safe manner. Homeschool parents, Single parents, Married parents, Foster parents, Aunties and Uncles raising neices and nephews, Grandparents raising grandchildren and more lets greet eachother, meet-up, get to know one another in this co-op to save on day and night care! Share with family, friends and neighbors. The bigger our network is the more resources we have for our families to swap with and even for backup care. &lt;br&gt;Please note that you should be willing to share who you are, your lifestyle, background and personal info as appropriate with the families that you are exchanging babysitting with.

My name is Stacy. I grew up in a small town in New Jersey where everyone knew everybody. I dated and married one of my best friends cousins. We had a demolition business together, got married, had a kid. We were together for 15 years. Life presented us with many challenges and ultimately our marriage ended. I went down a spiritual path studying everything from transcendental meditation to Kabbalah. Which led me to move closer to the city. After getting divorced and uprooting my entire life, which included changing careers I found myself in search of like minded people. Thus this Meetup... I'm looking to create something to help those who are in a similar situation and to bring us all together and enjoy our new endeavors in life. I'd like to create social events with single parents and kids, adults only events, and just some good old fashion fun. If you're like me and you want to meet like minded people come try my Meetup and let me know what kinds of things you'll like to do. Xo Stacy P.S.

This is a music group with performances by live vocal groups, bands, solo artists and other music based art, in rare cases of DJs spinning on a turntable. The music can range from R and B, Pop, Rock and Roll, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Reggae, Calypso, Soca, Merengue, Afro-Cuban, Reggaeton and anything else in between. Some events are local in New York City and New Jersey with dinner while others are day trip events with buses commuting from the five boroughs to dinner halls then concerts halls. Some live artist who participate are well known and others are up and coming. Some are events with 70's, 80's or 90's themes while others presenting the current styles of music. Some are live shows with artist and other are dancing events. These are usually free or low cost events that are sponsored by The Making A Difference with Morinda Organization which focuses on charity, health and fitness. So some events may include a short sponsorship presentation or venue advertisement of maintaining and living in better health from a sponsor representative for 30 minutes prior to a show.

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. In 2014 BNI members passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business. Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 20+ (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 20+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Tuesdays at 7:00AM at Junior's) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?!

This is a place where women can let down their guard, be vulnerable, and speak their truth while being held in a safe space. Circles happen on or near the evening of the new moon because this is the best time, astrologically, to plant seeds for what we long to manifest in our lives and for the world. Setting intentions with a group is a powerful practice because it allows your dreams and longings to be witnessed and supported by others. It also holds you accountable to taking the necessary action, internally and externally, to manifest your longings.

We want to make our love specific towards each other, people, the city, and life we encounter everyday. As we learn to live the way of Jesus, we tolerate a fairly high level of theological diversity and struggle, and try not to be easily breakable. We have very little formal organizational structure. We are not formally associated with any denomination, and we admire and owe our existence to many. Our community consists of Lutherans, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Seventh-day Adventists, Quakers, Presbyterians, Humanists, Jews, Muslims, and many other forgotten ones. The seed that grew into Citylights faith community was a \u201cseeker space\u201d that met in a church basement during the winter of 2000-2001. The group was comprised of people with various spiritual backgrounds and experiences, and included both people who thought of themselves as Christians and those who didn\u2019t. The shared purpose in coming together was to have a forum where it was safe to ask tough questions about spirituality and discuss possible answers, or open better questions, to be honest about what made sense and what didn\u2019t, and to enjoy the community itself. Out of this group emerged the vision for a faith community that could nourish honesty, creativity, and action, at any stage in their faith journey. During 2001-2002, the core group that began Citylights spent the year studying small-group community dynamics and developing a vision and road map for the future. In the winter of 2003, we launched two small-group communities that met in apartments on a weekday night. The intention was for people to get beyond the four walls of a church building and share real life together, and to reinforce the idea that true community requires regular interaction. In June 2003, Citylights started Saturday gatherings. In the fall of 2003, Citylights developed the vision to be a \u201ccommunity learning to love well.\u201d We believe that this is ultimate goal of being a follower of Jesus Christ. This vision guides both our visible and hidden curriculum. We are attempting to educate ourselves about God, ourselves, \u201cthe other,\u201d and all of life, so we can love well. We are activists for responsibility, justice and mercy in our city, because we think that\u2019s an expression of love for our fellow human beings. We love arts. We love to discuss. We love to sing. We love to dance. We love to eat. We want to love well and we believe that you can help us learn to love better! We are children friendly and have regular kids programing.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196394362,"name":"CityLights Community ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/highres_251855934.jpeg","photo_id":251855934,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/member_251855934.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/c\/5\/e\/thumb_251855934.jpeg"}},"members":189,"name":"Citylights NYC - A Progressive Christian Community","id":19179005,"state":"NY","urlname":"Citylights-NYC-A-Progressive-Christian-Community","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449173646000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"networkmarket","name":"Network Marketing","id":2532},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"networking-leads","name":"Networking Leads","id":16659},{"urlkey":"networking-social-gatherings","name":"Networking & Social Gatherings","id":16789},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"networking-events","name":"Networking Events","id":19961},{"urlkey":"business-to-business-network-marketing","name":"Business to Business Network Marketing","id":26217},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/https-www-facebook-com-463024237237597-7\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>International Networking Week\u00ae is an initiative of BNI\u00ae.

I myself often lack the focus, energy, time and motivation to cook healthy, wholesome meals, even though I have tons of cookbooks and know how to. Being single can do that to you, and it's not good for my waistline or my budget. We can meetup at my place (I have a large dining room and kitchen) and divide whatever meals people bring into tupperwares, taking home nice portions to eat through-out the week. One of the main reasons I don't like cooking as a single woman is leftovers... I'm not a fan... so this kind of takes care of that problem. Instead of eating the same meal 7 nights in a row, we can have 7 or more people come and eat a different meal each night of the week! My apartment has a very spacious living room, dining room and kitchen. It's best we prepare food at our own places, but if needed, we can do some meal prep at my place too. I have a slow cooker, rice cooker, deep fryer and every other cooking gadget imaginable. I'm no longer a vegetarian, so I'm open to meals of any kind. Healthy is nice though.

We gather in a safe, relaxed setting to discuss death, celebrate life, and drink tea (or coffee), and eat delicious cake together. Not morbid at all!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Death Caf\u00e9 was started in 2011 by Jon Underwood and based on the work of Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz. Bernard offered \"Caf\u00e9 Mortels\" in Switzerland and France. Jon read of this in a newspaper article in November 2010. Jon was already developing a project to get people talking about death and immediately knew that Bernard\u2019s vision clicked with his. Fast forward to July 2012, when Lizzy Miles brought Death Caf\u00e9 to the US in Columbus, Ohio. Today there are more than 2600 Death Caf\u00e9s held globally\u2026won't you be part of this growing movement? Our Death Caf\u00e9 welcomes, and is open to the community.

homeschooling. I started this group to establish a gathering that caters to raising godly children. It is so important for us to learn, teach, and demonstrate virtues (moral excellence) to our little ones. Meet-ups involve one or more of the following: &nbsp;prayer, bible reading\/teaching, goal-setting for our children,&nbsp;teaching colors, numbers, ABC's, teaching textures, shapes, and sizes, scripture memory, outdoor exploring, learning through nature, arts and crafts, health and fitness introduction, library meet-ups, discussions. My hope is to unite people committed to raising godly children, and for us to all grow as we seek direction from God. Let us get together and see what the Lord has in store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are especially welcome to this group if you have realized that parenting is more than you can handle on your own. &nbsp;You are especially welcome to this group If you have some relational issues that have not been resolved and you know it is affecting your parenting. &nbsp;You are especially welcome if you don't know where you stand with God. &nbsp;Everyone is in a different place in life and God knows it already. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There will be many resources shared during our meet-ups to coach us and help us along the parenting journey. &nbsp;So come on in and stay awhile.<\/p>","lon":-73.8899993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":28693232,"name":"Elle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/highres_251998184.jpeg","photo_id":251998184,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/member_251998184.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/thumb_251998184.jpeg"}},"members":22,"name":"Yonkers Homeschooling Meetup","id":19197308,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yonkers-Christian-Homeschooling-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Everyone"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449673014000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"private-lending","name":"Private Lending","id":30026},{"urlkey":"private-money-lending","name":"Private Money Lending","id":154505},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-lending","name":"Peer-to-Peer Lending","id":298291},{"urlkey":"building-the-sharing-economy","name":"Building the Sharing Economy","id":947992},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-economy","name":"Peer to Peer Economy","id":1173472},{"urlkey":"online-lending","name":"Online lending","id":1506119}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/P2P-and-Marketplace-Lending-Operators\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>* Who should join: People with general interest in p2p and marketplace lending should join.

We must schedule only for those who RSVP (usually for a Friday or Saturday night) &lt;br&gt;Once an event has been scheduled, you will need to RSVP \"yes\" or \"no\". &lt;br&gt;If you RSVP \"yes\" a $5 or more (if the event has a fee, i.e. Theatre group price) fee is required to reserve your place or event, and help alleviate my costs for the group or room rentals for some fun activities. &lt;br&gt; Our 'Let's Talk, New York' group is successful because people like you, show up on the night, and make it an enjoyable time.<\/p>\n<p><b>WHO CAN BE A MEMBER?<\/b> &lt;br&gt;The group is open to anyone aged 50+ who is single, and enjoys great company. Whether you are new in the city or have lived here all your life - I hope you can join us. Listening, talking, questioning, and sharing ideas is at the heart of friendships. We may not always agree, but hopefully each meet-up will give us a new perspective, and broaden our network of friends.<\/p>\n<p><b>AT THE DINNER EVENT<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Please arrive a little earlier than the scheduled time, so we can all be seated on time. You are responsible for the cost of your own food, drink and tip during the dinner.<\/p>\n<p>Open to ideas, as well, for possible activities we can all get involved in; i.e. Tarot\/Archangel Card Readings, attending street fairs (as a group), events, group past life regression (my speciality), photography days (with a professional teacher to guide us), tours of our beloved city, shows, movies and other fun activity plus discussion after!<\/p>\n<p>Please bring cash only and pay me when the check comes.<\/p>\n<p>Let's Talk, New York is about good food, great company, and interesting ideas.<\/p>\n<p>You are assured of a warm welcome!<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/8\/d\/highres_446333133.jpeg","photo_id":446333133,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/8\/d\/600_446333133.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/f\/8\/d\/thumb_446333133.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3030432,"name":"Angela Theresa","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/0\/d\/highres_253368397.jpeg","photo_id":253368397,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/0\/d\/member_253368397.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/0\/d\/thumb_253368397.jpeg"}},"members":218,"name":"'Let's Talk, New York' - Activities & Conversation - 50+","id":19207610,"state":"NY","urlname":"Lets-Talk-New-York-50","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Fabulously 50+"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edison","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450022749000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"workout","name":"Workout","id":22439},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/No-Excuse-Mom-Edison-NJ\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The purpose of this group is to serve as an inspiration and motivational hub for women who want to be healthy in the Edison, NJ area.

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in New York. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have. Or simply say hello and introduce yourself because I would like to learn about you and the projects you are working on!

Sadly, our previous organizer shut it down on New Year's Day 2016 (despite a stated intention not to do so), thereby wiping out all files, studies, reports, photos, discussions, e-lists, event history... and the entire institutional memory of the group. This represented the collective product of many feminists over a number of years. <br><\/p>\n<p>This valuable resource was created for the benefit of, and was open to, the entire Feminist community, members and non-members alike. It will take some time, but we will rebuild both the site and the collective inclusive spirit of the group. Silence in not an option. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please be a feminist or open to feminism if you join<\/b>. There are plenty of other groups to join if you are neither. Beyond that, we welcome feminists of all stripes, colors, creeds, and gender identities who are committed to challenging, confronting, and ultimately dismantling Patriarchy. Together we hope to forge a path to sexual equality and gender justice for all, not just by talking among ourselves, but by speaking out, writing, marching, demonstrating, protesting and actively projecting a loud and fierce voice in opposition to Rape Culture and the War on Women. <br><\/p>\n<p>Male supremacy must end. Oppression and violence is not natural or inevitable. Neither is patriarchy or any collection of interlocking\/intersecting systems of oppression. Radical Feminism, in the truest sense of the word 'Radical', is about going to the root of the systems of oppression that we all participate in and perpetuate, creating change from the ground up and making the world a better,&nbsp; more equitable, non-oppressive place. <br><\/p>\n<p>We believe change is not only possible but probable and above all necessary.

The tenants that enable the existence of this group of freedom, are respect for fellow sentries, an acceptance of the debate process and a undying comment to come to the aid of a fellow sentry.","lon":-73.7600021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190634267,"name":"Luke Meehan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/b\/4\/highres_252211412.jpeg","photo_id":252211412,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/b\/4\/member_252211412.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/b\/4\/thumb_252211412.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"The Sentry","id":19223988,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Sentry","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":41.0299987793,"who":"Sentries"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450530638000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classics","name":"Classic Books","id":506},{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"wine-lovers","name":"Wine Lovers","id":15634},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"mens-social-networking","name":"Men's Social Networking","id":17238},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Hoboken-Book-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"We'll meet on a Sunday once a month to discuss a piece of literature (fiction, non fiction, biography...depends on what we all vote on!) over drinks or a bite to eat.

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are looking for the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Photographers<\/p>\n<p>-DJs&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Tent rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Limousine rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Party Favor suppliers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Magicians&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Animal show businesses&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Inflatable rentals&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-Spray Art&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p>\n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo.

Our community focuses on the power of meditation, the study of truth and the vision of spiritual growth centered in divine love. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, we began a metaphysical journey through the Bible, which will continue as long as it takes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, we are still journeying through the Old Testament.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have been meeting since 2007 and offer several opportunities for spiritual growth and development, including a Sunday Powerpoint Session at 2:30 PM, where we discuss the Bible (this session is a nontraditional approach to spiritual growth, which is usually facilitated by Rev. Cecilia Loving or Rev. Marlon Cromwell at the Unity Center of NYC). We also meditate, pray, and sing. Our meetings are \"live-streamed\" on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truthunity.net\">www.truthunity.net<\/a> whenever possible. Some sessions are available on <a>www.spiritmuvvideo.com.<\/a> We have two weekly prayer calls: one on Saturday mornings from 7 AM to 7:30 AM and one on Monday evenings from 8 to 8:15 PM. We also have a class on the teachings of Joel Goldsmith on Tuesday evenings from 8:30 to 9:30 PM and will be continuing to study Rev. Loving's book GOD IS A BROWN GIRL TOO once a month. Most of our members belong to our church SPIRITMUV.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to anyone who wants to grow in the Spirit and embraces the teachings of many nontraditional masters, such as Joel Goldsmith, Paramahansa Yogananda, Thich Nhat Hanh, Esther Hicks, Eric Butterworth, Charles Fillmore, Elizabeth Sand Turner, and Rev.
