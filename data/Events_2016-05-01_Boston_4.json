Step-by-step, Rip will guide you on how to take control of your own health through: undertaking a top-to-bottom pantry clean-out, showing how to navigate the grocery store aisles to not get burned by misleading nutritional labels and cooking lessons to make tantalizingly plant-strong dishes.<\/p> <p><br\/>About the Book:<\/p> <p>The Engine 2 Diet appeared on The New York Times Best Seller List and was endorsed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who made a public appearance with Esselstyn in January 2013. In 2010, Whole Foods Market included The Engine 2 Diet as a \"Healthy Eating Partner.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Professional athlete-turned-firefighter Rip Esselstyn is used to responding to emergencies. So, when he learned that some of his fellow Engine 2 firefighters in Austin, TX, were in dire physical condition-several had dangerously high cholesterol levels (the highest was 344!)-he sprang into action and created a life-saving plan for the firehouse. His plant-powered eating plan is based on a diet of whole foods, including whole grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds.<\/p> <p><br\/>This invaluable guide features: dozens of easy, mouthwatering recipes-from pancakes to pizza, Tex-Mex favorites to knockout chocolate desserts-that will keep you looking forward to every bite; Pantry-stocking tips will take the panic out of inevitable cravings and on-the-fly meals; guidelines on menu choices that will allow you to eat out, wherever and whenever you want; Rip's simple, firefighter-inspired exercise program that will boost your metabolism and melt your fat away.<\/p> <p><br\/>Medically approved, easy-to-follow, and amazingly effective, this diet is designed for anyone who wants to make heroic strides in his or her health, weight, and well-being-all without heroic effort.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Metro-Boston-Vegetarians\/events\/228706107\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":5400000,"name":"Discussion of The Engine 2 Diet and The Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue","id":"228706107","time":1462050000000,"updated":1462068036000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424266793000,"name":"Social Metro Boston Vegetarians","group_lon":-71.2200012207,"id":18443485,"urlname":"Social-Metro-Boston-Vegetarians","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Vegetarians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"338 Newbury St, 3rd flr","name":"Karma Yoga Studio -- Newbury","lon":-71.086685,"id":19514562,"lat":42.348469,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.16876602173,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422410774000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join me this Saturday at Karma Yoga Studio (right above Trident Cafe on Newbury St.) for \"Namaste Saturdays\" which is a 40 minute meditation class followed by 20 minutes of group reiki.

I will help challenge your assumptions about what makes an interesting photo by giving you specific structured assignments. \u00a0I design these assignments very carefully to build your skills step by step.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/d\/5\/600_448303989.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo By Robert L. workshop participant. Wonderful use of diagonal composition and geometric shapes.<\/p> <p>You will have a chance to try these out right away with my guidance. You will receive individual coaching and critique while we are in the field shooting. This way you can be confident that you will be able to repeat the process next time you are out on a shoot.<\/p> <p>We will work with color, texture, pattern, and light to make our photos come to life. As always, this is a non technical jargon zone. It is all about the creative act of seeing and capturing the moments of life with a fresh eye.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/e\/4\/600_448339428.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by Lisa W.

We will go beyond the rule of thirds in this workshop.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0You are attracted to the visual elements of color, pattern and texture.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/6\/c\/6\/600_448329926.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by workshop participant Deb D. \u00a0using zoom technique during class.<\/p> <p>Any camera is fine for this shoot. You can even use your iPhone if you like. This is a fun, fast paced workshop. So if you would like to meet other people who love photography and are curious about how to take better photos, I hope you will join us. \u00a0If you do have a tripod and wide angle lens this is a good opportunity to use them.<\/p> <p>The tuition for the workshop is $45.00 and included handouts, one on one instruction as needed. If you need some extra help with camera settings we can do that too. \u00a0I am keeping the group size small for this one. Only 10.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be staying out for Blue Hour, that magical time after sunset when the sky turns brilliant blue and the lights of the city start to come up. We will end class in a spot where you can take a spectacular image of the Boston Skyline.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/d\/3\/600_449365299.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Photo by professional photographer Chris Lazier Boston Skyline Blue hour.

Chris Hemsworth and Oscar\u00ae winner Charlize Theron return to their roles in \"The Huntsman Winter\u2019s War,\" an epic action-adventure in which they are joined by Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain, as well as director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. Producer Joe Roth (\"Maleficent,\" \"Alice in Wonderland\") once again leads the team in a breathtaking new tale nested in the legendary saga.<\/p> <p>Long before the evil Queen Ravenna (Theron) was thought vanquished by Snow White\u2019s blade, she watched silently as her sister, Freya (Blunt), suffered a heartbreaking betrayal and fled their kingdom.

No matter what you call it, Syrah is one of the darkest red wines on the market. Although Syrah originated in France, Syrah wines from the region tend to be expensive when sold in the U.S. In contrast, due to the larger amount of land devoted to the grape in Australia, Australian wineries have been able to produce the wine much more affordably, and it is due to this that the name Shiraz has become even more widely known on the American market than the grape\u2019s original name, Syrah.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s enjoy a spring evening with good wines, good food, and fun conversation with new and old friends.

GEORGE CATHEDRALEASTER SERVICES ~ 2016<\/p> <p>Dear Parishioners &amp; Guests of St. George Cathedral:<br\/>We wish you a most holy and safe Easter celebration. In order to provide for the safety and comfort of each of you, the following rules will be followed during our Easter services:<br\/>1. All parishioners must be seated during the services. Standing will only be permitted in assigned areas. There can be no blocking of aisles or impeding access to safety exits. Please come to church early to be sure that you have a seat. Easter Resurrection Liturgy will begin on Saturday, April 30, promptly at 10:00 PM. Children under 12 years of age must be under adult supervision at all times.<\/p> <p><br\/>2. Candles and Open Flames: \u00a0Children under 12 years of age are not permitted to have open flame candles. Safety light sticks will be available for them. All candles held by adults must be extinguished at the direction of the church ushers. At the announced time during the services, all candles will need to be extinguished for the safety of others. \u00a0SMOKING IS PROHIBITED ANYWHERE WITHIN CHURCH BUILDINGS.<br\/>*** THE BOSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES STRICT\u00a0ADHERENCE TO THESE RULES ***<\/p> <p><br\/>3. Appropriate dress is a sign of respect for God. Please, no extreme attire or hair styles (both men and women) are to be worn at church services.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. Please refrain from talking during the services. Persons who wish to hold conversations should do so outside the church building.<\/p> <p><br\/>5. Please TURN OFF all cell phones and pagers while in the church.<\/p> <p><br\/>6. Parking is always an issue of concern in South Boston. Please make an effort to park beyond the front of the Cathedral and walk to the Cathedral in order to minimize the blockage of traffic. Ushers will make announcements with signs about cars that need to be moved immediately due to blocking. Under no circumstances should cars block fire hydrants. Cars parked in front of fire hydrants or at bus stops are subject to immediate ticketing and towing for the safety of us all. For safety sake, please follow the directions of ushers or police when parking or crossing streets.<\/p> <p><br\/>By following these simple requests, our Easter celebration will be both memorable and safe for us all.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thank you and Happy Easter!<\/p> <p><br\/>St. George Cathedral Advisory Board<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Contact Erin K., at (978) 395-7020 or admin@eventalb.com with questions or concerns","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/albanian-events\/events\/230760846\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Celebrate Easter with the Albanian Community at St. George. a.k.a Kisha e Nolit","id":"230760846","time":1462064400000,"updated":1462077140000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1395872718000,"name":"Albanian-Events","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":13570102,"urlname":"albanian-events","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Shqip\u00ebtar\/Albanians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02148","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Malden ","address_1":"53 Summer St","lon":-71.073714,"phone":"781-322-6410","name":"Pearl Street Station","id":732229,"state":"MA","lat":42.42886,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.77115821838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461943770000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Sing or watch!
