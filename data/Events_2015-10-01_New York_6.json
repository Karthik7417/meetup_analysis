Much of his work is organizational-design consulting with senior-management teams of product groups adopting LeSS.<\/p> <p>Craig has served as the lead coach of large-scale lean software development adoption at\u00a0Xerox, and serves or has served as a consultant for LeSS at Ericsson, JP Morgan, Cisco-Tandberg, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Alcatel-Lucent, UBS, bwin.party, Nokia Networks\u00a0and Siemens Networks, and Ion Trading, among many other clients. Craig has also served as\u00a0chief scientist at Valtech and while living in Bengaluru India, at Valtech\u2019s development\u00a0centre helped to create agile offshore development with LeSS.<\/p> <p>In addition to his focus on hands-on LeSS consulting and product work, he occasionally\u00a0speaks in public, such as keynoting on LeSS at the 2014 Software Executive Summit, the\u00a02013 Agile India conference, and the 2011 QCon conference.<\/p> <p>Craig has been named one of the top 20 Agile influencers of all time (see\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valueflowquality.com\/the-top-20-most-influential-agile-people)\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valueflowquality.com\/the-top-20-most-influential-agile-people\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.valueflowquality.com\/the-top-20-most-influential-agile-people<\/a>)<\/a>\u00a0and is the\u00a0author of several books on scaling lean &amp; agile development with LeSS, including:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Scaling Lean &amp; Agile Development: Thinking &amp; Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum<\/p> <p>\u2022 Practices for Scaling Lean &amp; Agile Development: Successful Large, Multisite &amp; Offshore\u00a0Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Agile &amp; Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide<\/p> <p>Craig was one of the first Certified Scrum Trainers, and helped kick off the Agile movement,\u00a0especially with his 2003 book \u201cAgile &amp; Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide\u201d.<\/p> <p>LeSS \u2013 Large-Scale Scrum<\/p> <p>What is the strength of Scrum? That\u2019s not an easy question to answer. Of course, the\u00a0principles behind Scrum, such astransparency, empirical process control, iterative\u00a0development, and\u00a0self-managing cross-functional teams of multi-skilled workers\u00a0are\u00a0critical. But there\u2019s something else, subtle but important:\u00a0Scrum hits the sweet spot between\u00a0abstract principles and concrete practices.<\/p> <p>Thus, in order to keep\u00a0Large-Scale Scrum as Scrum, we\u2019ll need to find a similar balance, so\u00a0that we will be able to say:\u00a0For large groups, LeSS hits the sweet spot between defined\u00a0concrete elements and empirical process control.<\/p> <p>This leads to some decisions in the creation of LeSS:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0LeSS needs to be simple<\/p> <p>When scaling, there is a tendency to add roles,\u00a0artefacts, processes, etc. This should\u00a0be avoided so that a process can empirically be created by the product group. Most\u00a0other scaling frameworks fall into the trap of providing a detailed defined process\u00a0with many prescribed methods. In LeSS we want to avoid that trap and keep LeSS\u00a0minimal and simple.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Large-Scale Scrum is truly Scrum scaled<\/p> <p>Rather than having Scrum simply as a lower-level building block for a different scaled\u00a0framework that is inconsistent with Scrum at higher levels, we need to look at Scrum\u00a0and for each element ask \u201cWhy is it there?\u201d followed by \u201cIf we have more than one\u00a0team, how can we achieve the same purpose on a larger scale, and remain\u00a0consistent with Scrum principles all the way up?\u201d<\/p> <p><b>For more information\u2026<\/b><\/p> <p>The website for LeSS, including case studies of various companies adopting LeSS (Ericsson,\u00a0JP Morgan, and more) is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.adventureswithagile.com\/feedback\/\">feedback page<\/a>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/f\/6\/600_440252758.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b><\/p> <p>The location will be in Manhattan to be confirmed shortly.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Adventures-with-Agile\/events\/224209706\/","yes_rsvp_count":41,"duration":7200000,"name":"Craig Larman - Free Evening Meetup","id":"224209706","time":1442527200000,"updated":1442579988000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1437996964000,"name":"New York Adventures with Agile","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18775257,"urlname":"New-York-Adventures-with-Agile","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"336 3rd Street","name":"Old Stone House","lon":-73.983833,"id":5663042,"state":"NY","lat":40.673042,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":5.33803606033,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1433953114000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Park-Slope-Footie-and-a-Pint\/events\/223223890\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Thursday Evening Game","id":"kkzcklytmbwb","time":1442527200000,"updated":1442539724000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328766096000,"name":"Park Slope Soccer and a Pint","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3261772,"urlname":"Park-Slope-Footie-and-a-Pint","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"121 Wooster St, New York, NY 10012","name":"Athleta ","lon":0,"id":24013937,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14227032661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440693512000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Juice Crawl is the World's First Pub Crawl for Juice!<\/b><\/p> <p>Join Us Sept 17th for the First-Ever Silent Disco Juice Party!

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

The longest he has been outside of the five boroughs of New York City is three weeks.<\/p> <p>Charlie has a reputation for being early to identifying important companies. Nick Bilton identifies him as an influence on early Twitter investors in his book, Hatching Twitter. Dennis Crowley credits him as having helped kick off the first funding of Foursquare before other VCs had said yes.

We will start at the beginning of the mile markers which is near the exit, not near the entrance. There's parking close to the beginning of the path. If you cannot park in the lot nearest the beginning of the path, you'll need to reenter the park and park in the next closest lot. The driving area of the park is U-shaped so to get to the parking lot closest to the start of the run, you essentially drive around the \"U\" and approach the exit to the last lot on the right (by the dog park).<\/p> <p><br\/>We will start at the \"Wild Duck Pond Area\" and will turn around at some point. If you'd like to run additional miles, you are certainly more than welcome to do so as the mile markers make it simple to track your distance. Depending on the turnout we sometimes break off into little groups of two or three people, each of which may go at slightly different paces and\/or distances. Regardless, if you wish to run at a slower pace, I am more than happy to run with you at your preferred pace. Nobody gets left in the dust. This is a fun run, not a competition.<\/p> <p>For those who wish to stick around after the run, we may get together at (insert favorite Ridgewood hot spot here) to relax, catch up, and share some laughs. When we do this, we usually get to the restaurant between 7:30 and 7:45. If anyone cares to join us that didn't come to the run, you are certainly welcome.<\/p> <p>We will run rain or shine, hot or cold. If you RSVP \"Yes\", please do your best to be on time as we'll only wait a couple of minutes past 6:30 PM to get rolling. If you have questions, comments, or doubts, feel free to email me.

They have more than a dozen of prestigious awards including Webby, Emmy, Red Dot, .NET, Awwwards and, obviously, \u201cCannes Lions\u201d.

But what begins as a flight for survival soon leads to something much more: a startling vision of human destiny... and the birth of a new faith.\"<\/p> <p>Next month's meeting should be a great follow up to our recent discussion of The Left Hand of Darkness as we continue to talk about classic feminist sci-fi novels.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club\/events\/224951897\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":5400000,"name":"September Book Club - Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler","id":"224951897","time":1442530800000,"updated":1442763929000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1315347100000,"name":"NYC Girl Geek Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":2444702,"urlname":"NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10962","country":"us","city":"Orangeburg","address_1":"470 Western Highway","name":"Dominican College, Granito Center","lon":-73.950592,"id":15501432,"state":"NY","lat":41.047195,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.6791706085,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1388538983000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come spend some time with us in a supportive setting!

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

The influences of Mercury Retrograde occurs when it is moving backwards, into its shadow, and thus communication, scheduling, electrical devices, transportation and judgment becomes effected. As Mercury Retrograde creates challenges in our outer reality it also contronts on how we react to those challenges in our inner reality. Most of us encounter these challenges when we are not aware or conscious of what is going on around us. When we are not acting from our heart and spirit. Instead we react from our needs, our hurts, or from our buttons being pushed. In that way we act from our shadow, and that is what mercury retrograde is all about. It becomes the perfect time to bring healing to our issues<\/p> <p>With the power of the Merlin\u2019s Grace we will bring deep healing and transformation to the many levels Mercury Retrograde brings up. I first start by invoking what is called the Planetary Puja. I will encompass all participants in a grid of divine healing essence. I invoke the puja and from there the divine grid will heal all negativity and disharmonious influences that are occurring within your astrological chart. I then channel the Merlin\u2019s Grace divine healing essence to bring healing on all levels and dimension to the specific issues that Mercury Retrograde confronts. This is accompanied by a karmic healing that will bring a powerful acceleration to any karmic issues that may also occur during the retrograde. With this group healing your receive a powerful advantage of healing acceleration, awareness and deep clarity that you carry with you all throughout the retrograde.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* Please bring your cell phones, lap tops or any other devices where you will receive special divine structures to help protect them during the retrograde.<\/p> <p>Admission: $35<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\">www.simondeacon.com<\/a><br\/>Phone:[masked]<\/p> <p>\u00ae \u201cVortexHealing\" is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

Here's an excerpt from the Serious Eats review:<\/p> <p>\"Amid mild protest, I impressed upon my dining companions another serving of all-you-can-eat meat, to be grilled at the table. We were at\u00a0Picnic Garden\u00a0in Flushing, and to their dismay, I'd gone to the self-serve buffet table and fetched a fatty swath of\u00a0samgyeopsal\u00a0(pork belly), a healthy mound of\u00a0bulgogi\u00a0(marinated and sliced sirloin), grainy and livery tangles of\u00a0gopchang\u00a0(spicy small intestine) and fiery\u00a0dak galbi\u00a0(marinated chicken thighs). It was all thoughtful filler, really. I'd dutifully stopped by the banchan station and picked up a bowl of sliced green chili peppers, a pepper with subdued but lingering heat, which are meant to be coated with\u00a0dwenjang\u00a0(salty fermented bean paste) and serve as an appetite stimulant. But as it turned out, the only stimulant that one needs at Picnic Garden, is their excellent\u00a0galbi\u00a0(marinated short rib), which is served by the tub-full.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Don't worry; a trained medical professional will be present in case of any kalbi-induced heart attacks.<\/p> <p>Cost will be about $32 per person plus tax and tip (total of about $39). Please bring cash only.<\/p> <p>Directions: 7 train to Flushing Main Street Station, and either take the Q13\/Q28 bus from 39th Ave\/138 St and get off at Northern Blvd and 147th St or walk North East along Roosevelt Ave, turn left on 149th St., restaurant will be at the corner of Northern Boulevard and 149th St. Alternatively, take the 7 train to Woodside 61st Street, catch the Port Washington 6424 Bus and stop in Murray Hill.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/0hApk-yym_DqLhA77OdClw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/cAEKzuKa8YU7FeGszgMgKQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/yhTPKS2YO8A_iMg2TyLZOw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/224866347\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"All-you-can-eat Korean BBQ (Flushing)","id":"224866347","time":1442530800000,"updated":1442585063000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

Tantra has enhanced my capacity to interact in a more positive healthy way with family, friends, acquaintances, and others.<\/b><\/p> <p><i>When you open up through Orgasmic Meditation, you start to get everything you want because you learn how to actually receive it. Then the game really begins! We are built to filter how much good stuff can come in at once or it is destabilizing to our \"when do I get mine\" identity. The longer I OMed, I've had to get really good at HAVING. At allowing my desires to actually come to me, change me, change my life, remake me. And it takes a lot of attention. It's like managing a lot of money in a way - you have to begin to look at questions like, what do I want to do with all this wealth? How do I want to spend it? How can I not let it go to my head? How do I share it where it will be used well? And maybe the biggest question: how do I not sabotage it all so I can just go back to my comfort level of not-having and complaining?<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Come listen to me muse on the topic of HAVING what you desire and how to do it well.

In April of 2013, Christi debuted her original music at The Whitney Museum's Blues for Smoke exhibit.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Whiskey<\/p> <p>McKenzie Bourbon<\/p> <p>McKenzie Bourbon Whiskey is a very rich bourbon with just enough rye spice to complement the subtle sweetness. A local variety of corn makes 70% of the mash bill. We age in new charred barrels and finish in local chardonnay casks, which gives the bourbon a round, buttery finish. Master Distiller Thomas Earl says: \u201cSome folks think you can only make bourbon in Kentucky. Bull. We went way back for this bourbon, aging it at a lower proof for that good old fashioned bourbon flavor.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nMcKenzie Rye\u00a0<\/p> <p>McKenzie Rye\u00a0Whiskey is made from local rye grain and is distilled using old-time techniques. We age this whiskey in new charred oak casks and finish in sherry barrels from local wineries.

Thirteen months after taking sannyas, while sitting \u00a0with his friends he experienced his \"happening\" which over a short period of time blossomed into enlightenment.<\/p> <p>Soon friends and seekers started to refer him as BABA.\u00a0 Baba is a term of respect or endearment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Friends from USA have been trying hard to invite him to USA and faced many hurdles in past but all things are falling in place now. Perhaps we are ready now.

Expand your life energy ( Prana ), and celebrate it \u2026\u00a0<br\/>Strengthen it trough Pranayama, allow it to flow in dance and in Kundalini meditation, purify it trough Nadabrahma, make your life energy flow healthy and natural and enjoy yourself \u2026\u00a0<br\/>I cannot explain to you this mystery, but when you are fully enjoying your vitality herenow, you are also very close to awareness.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Only one step more. Just sit, doing nothing, and relax inside yourself.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0And slowly slowly, day by day, you find what you are searching for. You disappear into this beautiful Existence. Now you are at home. \u201c\u00a0<br\/>BABA\u00a0<\/p> <p>BABA : \u2026 HOW TO GO DEEPER IN MEDITATION ?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c In meditation you don\u2019t need to make efforts. In fact, if you are making efforts you will remain outside yourself, you will not go deeper.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0The very first need is to relax yourself. Because in meditation you don\u2019t have to do anything. Just relax, completely relax. Surrender. Surrender to Existence. Relax as deeply as possible.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Sit in whatever posture is comfortable for you. There is no problem. Just go on relaxing completely.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0The second step is to enjoy your breathing. Just feel the breath, don\u2019t force it. It will take 5 or 10 minutes, but slowly slowly you will become aware of it \u2026\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your body should completely relaxed, and just feel your natural breathing. Remember it, it should be natural, don\u2019t force it ! Automatically YOUR BREATHING WILL GO DEEPER AND DEEPER, and it will touch your life centre. It is already touching it, but you are not aware of it. Because you are identified with your mind, and it will take some time for your mind to become aware of your center.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0So feel your breathing, don\u2019t watch it, feel it. It will go deeper and deeper and at a certain point it will touch your life centre. The moment you touch it there will be a sparkling of life energy, and a new current will be felt in your body. A new, very beautiful energy flow.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0There is no need to bring your attention to the third eye centre. This chakra is part of the mind. Sometimes there is a purification there, but don\u2019t make efforts to bring energy to this chakra. Your real centre is the Navel centre. This has been your centre from the very beginning. When you where in the womb, you were getting oxygen without breathing, from your mother. And the connection with your mother was trough the navel centre. All kind of food, all kind of energy, all your life needs you are getting from your navel centre.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0When you will bring awareness to your breathing in a more and more loving way, you will discover that the navel is your life centre, you will reach there.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0At this moment you will be in the womb again. You can live without breathing, because your navel centre will be again open and working. And you will feel that you are breathing from the navel, and the all Existence is your womb. You will be again a baby. To become a baby again is the all purpose of the spiritual journey : it is called being twice born.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0Deep down it is our deepest desire to become a baby again. We want to be fresh, loving, holy\u2026 you can see, the baby has all these qualities. When you are going to bed, all your arrangements for comfort, AC and all, are actually the search of the lost womb. Human beings all search is how to feel in the womb again. Because we all have a taste of it, when we were in the womb it was a blissful time. Everybody is searching that feeling again. You try outside yourself to find the womb again, but you cannot succeed.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0You can find it through awareness of the breath. You will find again the state of consciousness when your breath will stop. In that moment you will feel that the all Existence is your mother. When you will be aware of the navel center your breath will stop again, as when you were in your mother\u2019s womb. In that moment your thinking will stop too. Thinking cannot function without breathing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0Just be aware, very much aware of the navel centre. Even while you are walking, you are working, in every activity of life, most of the time come back to the navel centre.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0When you are going to bed be aware of the navel centre. Then in the morning you can dance, you can sing a song \u2026 because you are new !\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0And during the day live lovingly with your breathing, this loving awareness of your breath will bring you to awareness of the navel. You will be more and more free from your mind, living in the here and now. And one day, Samadhi, enlightenment will happen \u2026. \u201c\u00a0<\/p> <p>BABA<\/p> <p><b>I am so much in love with Osho.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u00a0After my enlightenment I wrote him a letter saying\u00a0<\/b><br\/>\u2018You are nothing,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0And I am nothing\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0And nothing is nothing\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Only bliss. \u201c\u00a0<br\/>And I got such a beautiful reply from Osho,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0saying that when such a state happens to someone\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0his doors are open towards the divine.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Normally if someone would have written to him\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0such a thing he would have got a zen -stick from him\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0but he showered me with his blessings and love.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0I live so much in his love\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0that for me as a person Osho does not exist.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0He is still there only as a subtle presence,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0a nothingness.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0So my understanding is not to worship the person\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0but live through his message.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0He has been trying hard to take us out\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0of those old patterns.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0We need courage to understand his message,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and this courage will come when you will start\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0standing on your own feet from within.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Osho\u2019s message is spreading through books and media\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0but this is only on the material level.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0His message actually is in the air,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0in a subtle, mysterious form.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0When there is an enlightened master\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0like Osho or Krishna\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0who shared so much wisdom,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0their discourses do not die.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0They are still present in the universe\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and whenever a person is ready\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0they are available to him.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Whatsoever Osho has said is recorded\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0in the akashik records.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0This existence is a very big tape recorder\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and whenever someone becomes aware\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0the sutras will once again become alive in him.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Even if a sadhu is sitting in the Himalayas\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0they will be available to him.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0So whenever it will be needed the message will be felt.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0This knowledge is not limited to the books;\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0it is much more than that.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Osho is an expression and the proof of Godliness,\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and our being on this planet also has the same meaning\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0that Godliness expresses his creation through us.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0And realizing him in this life\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0is the only reason to be on this planet.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0We are the proof and through us he is realized.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0We don\u2019t have to become anything else\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0than the proof of Godliness \u2018 existence.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0Osho gave this message by his divine being\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and by his presence.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0So this message will definitely spread in humanity\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0and the birth of that new man is already in process. \u201c\u00a0<br\/>BABA\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0( translated by Ma Prathna, excerpt from the Hindi video \u201c Baba in Ganga Dham 2010 \u201c )<\/p> <p><br\/>?Questions?\u00a0- If you have any additional questions then please reach out to any organizer via meetup message or send email to [masked]\u00a0\u00a0or<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Swami Narinder \u00a0&lt;a&gt;[masked]\u00a0<br\/>&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0 \u00a0Ma Nirupa \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0[masked]<br\/>Swami Parimal \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&lt;a&gt;[masked]<br\/>&lt;\/a&gt;<\/b><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Dress recommendation for event<\/b>:\u00a0Loose clothing.

Mark will be speaking via Skype to a PowerPoint presentation produced for this occasion. Questions are encouraged.<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b>Mark Kimmel has spoken at international forums, been a guest on radio and television shows, and has conducted workshops based on his unique insights into the transformation of Earth and her humans. Mark's books first three books, \u201c<i>Trillion<\/i>,\u201d \u201c<i>Decimal<\/i>,\u201d &amp; \u201c<i>One<\/i>,\u201d depict the activities benevolent ETs among us along with negative aspects of our 3rd Dimension paradigm. \u201c<i>Transformation<\/i>,\u201d contain messages from Andromedans and celestials. His new book, \u201c<i>Chrysalis<\/i>,\u201d is being written in conjunction with the Archangels and is contains information new to this planet. By focusing on both extraterrestrials and Archangels in his writing and speaking, Mark weaves a most credible picture of cosmic reality while presenting an uplifting vision for the future of mankind and of our planet. Mark avoids the \u201cevil aliens\u201d orientation of many who deal with ETs, while presenting insights about Archangels without a religious orientation. Mark moved to his current passion from a successful business career where he had worked for major corporations, then founded and ran three of the most respected Colorado venture capital funds. In addition to providing capital, Mark served on portfolio companies\u2019 boards and helped them with strategy and tactics. He retired from business in 1996 to pursue his quest into the larger aspects of our existence. Mark has been listed in Who\u2019s Who since 1985. He has degrees in engineering, marketing, finance, psychology, and divinity. Mark is married with two grown sons and four grandchildren. He spends his days writing and speaking about this, the pivotal juncture in human history, and how each person has the power to assist this metamorphic transformation for all on this planet and in this universe. He is the founder of the <b>Cosmic Paradigm Network<\/b>, an international group dedicated to manifesting such a transformation.

Focusing on creative ways to operate the catering company\u2019s Sushi station, in a kosher world where you can\u2019t mix fish and meat, Chef Guy came up with the idea of incorporating healthy fruit, vegetable, and whole grain based ingredients. Over a period of several years and after seeing a demand for healthy vegan food in the New York Market, the idea grew from there and the foundation for Beyond Sushi (The Green Roll) was born. Esprit Events is also where Guy met his wife, Tali, who together own the Beyond Sushi brand and where Tali Vaknin, with extensive experience in public relations and event planning, initiated their catering division.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/a\/0\/600_436597536.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Chef Vaknin was not a vegetarian or vegan prior to opening the restaurant, but according to a Q&amp;A on his website \u201cI was ignorant about this \u2018vegan\u2019 industry.\u00a0 I sat down and learned. What am I doing? I like to watch documentaries. That\u2019s one of my hobbies. And I\u2019ve seen all the documentaries about veganism \u2013 Forks Over Knives, Earthlings, etc. I felt like it was something I should try. It felt great. It changed my life completely. It became part of my lifestyle. Now I am fully vegan\u201d.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/600_436620157.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Beyond Sushi has proven its popularity among Manhattanites, with the opening, last November, at a third location in Midtown West. \u201cWe\u2019ve done really well on 14th Street and in Chelsea Market,\u201d says Chef Guy Vaknin. Things were going really great and they\u2019re still going that way. But it\u2019s time to go to a big market,\u201d continues Vaknin. \u201cI felt we needed to do something in the heart of the city. I picked that area because of the lunch crowd. It\u2019s the right time to take the next step.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/e\/a\/600_436597610.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Vegan sushi rolls from left to right: Spicy Mang, the Haricat, Mighty Mushroom, and Crunch N\u2019 Munch.<\/p> <p>Behind the counter looks like a salad bar, but instead of a collection of lettuce and tomatoes, you see yellow pickles, fresh green avocados and forbidden black rice or their 6 grain rice medley. In the name of nutrition, flavor and aesthetics, Chef Vaknin employs black Chinese forbidden rice and a six grain rice made from rye berries, two types of barley, black rice, brown rice and red rice. There is no white rice.\u00a0Beyond Sushi's core menu is built off those grains. \u00a0Why those grains? According to their website, they each contain health benefits way more potent than plain white rice. Purple barley is higher in protein and fiber, and also contains the same antioxidants as blueberries. Black rice is believed to help reduce blood pressure, and is a good source of fiber and iron. Brown rice has fiber, protein, plus vitamin B, while rye berries are also high in fiber and protein, in addition to phosphorus, iron and potassium. Finally, red rice increases blood circulation and contains monacolins, compounds which help to lower LDL or bad cholesterol.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/8\/600_436620392.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With vegan Sushi this good, who needs the fish!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>At Beyond Sushi you can find a variety of delicious and creative\u00a0sushi rolls,\u00a0sushi pieces, as well as Vegan wraps and salads, and they make all of their own custom sauces such as Carrot Ginger, Sweet Soy Mirin, Shiitake Teriyaki, White Miso, and more, using grapeseed oil, tofu, and veggie pur\u00e9e, all in an effort to cut down on the sodium, which is inherent in classic sushi via the soy sauce, another plus at Beyond Sushi.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/e\/1\/600_436604769.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Nutty Buddy<\/p> <p>Those looking to go beyond just a roll will find satisfaction in one of the three rice paper wraps including the protein packed\u00a0<i>Nutty Buddy<\/i>\u00a0that gets its protein lift\u00a0from buckwheat noodles, tofu and jalapeno peanut butter.

On this tour, we discover some of the Met\u2019s queer treasures, from ancient Greek nudes (and erotic vase-painting, which is my academic expertise) to homoerotic paintings from the Renaissance, and a panoply of modern works, some by LGBT artists, some portraying LGBT people and some expressing same-sex desire. We learn about famous pieces\u2014from Michelangelo\u2019s Cupid to Picasso\u2019s portrait of Gertrude Stein\u2014but in addition we explore lesser-known artists and works that are often ignored. And we delve into the fascinating forms of homosexuality in other cultures, such as same-sex initiation rites in New Guinea, represented in the Met\u2019s Oceania collection. It\u2019s all part of the hidden gay story in our city's great art museum, and I promise it will change your view of the Met!<\/p> <p>Anyway, I have long thought I should offer the tour to our meetup group, and now I am leaving New York for several months (mainly, to give the first ever gay history and art tour of Italy!), so I decided to finally schedule it.<\/p> <p>I apologize in advance for charging so much ($35 regular, $15 students and Met members) but sadly the museum charges a steep admission for group members.

Over time\u00a0a fluent interface retreats to your subconscious. You don't need to\u00a0bring it to mind; the code just flows out of your fingers. I strive\u00a0for this fluency in all the packages I write, and while I don't always\u00a0succeed, I think I've learned some valuable lessons along the way.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss three guidelines that make it easier to\u00a0develop fluent interfaces:<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Pure functions<\/b>. A pure function only interacts with the world\u00a0through its inputs and outputs; it has no side-effects. Pure\u00a0functions make great building blocks because they're are easy to\u00a0reason about and can be easily composed.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Predictable interfaces<\/b>. It's easier to learn a function if it's\u00a0consistent, because you can learn the behaviour of a whole group of\u00a0functions at once. I'll highlight the benefits of predictability with\u00a0some of my favourite R \"WAT\"s (including `c()`, `sapply()` and\u00a0`sample()`).<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Pipes<\/b>. Pure predictable functions are nice in isolation but\u00a0are most powerful in combination. The pipe, `%&gt;%`, is particularly\u00a0in important when combining many functions because it turns function\u00a0composition on its head so you can read it from left-to-right. I'll\u00a0show you how this has helped me build dplyr, rvest, ggvis, lowliner,\u00a0stringr and more.<\/p> <p>This talk will help you make best use of my recent packages, and teach\u00a0you how to apply the same principles to make your own code easier to\u00a0use.<\/p> <p><b>About Hadley<\/b>:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/had.co.nz\/\">Hadley<\/a> is Chief Scientist at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rstudio.com\/\">RStudio<\/a> and a member of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/foundation\/\">R Foundation<\/a>.\u00a0He builds tools (computational and cognitive) to support data science.\u00a0His work includes R packages for data analysis (<a href=\"http:\/\/ggvis.rstudio.com\/\">ggvis<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hadley\/dplyr\">dplyr<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/tidyr\/vignettes\/tidy-data.html\">tidyr<\/a>),\u00a0data ingest (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hadley\/readr\">readr<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hadley\/readxl\">readxl<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hadley\/haven\">haven<\/a>), and principled software\u00a0development (<a href=\"https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/roxygen2\/vignettes\/roxygen2.html\">roxygen2<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/hadley\/testthat\">testthat<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstudio.com\/products\/rpackages\/devtools\/\">devtools<\/a>).

The result was Nicolas Cage in Fire Birds.<\/p> <p><br\/>Yes, this month we go back to the well of everybody's favorite bonkers actor, Nic Cage. Cage stars as Jake Preston, the star chopper pilot. He tries to go head-to-head with commanding officer Brad Little (played by Tommy Lee Jones) in a display of one upping outlandishness to prove who is the craziest and therefore deserves to stay at the training base. (Don't think about it too much.) Fire Birds is a flat and forgettable copycat of a film, with little acting and less story, but plenty of yelling and explosions.

She enjoys a challenging, fast-paced career as a lobbyist; Dave (Chestnut), her longterm boyfriend loves her. And yet at 36, she's ready to move to the next phase. Marriage and a family seem a logical and welcome step. Dave is not so sure. A bit of a commitment phobic, his misgivings lead to a painful break up. Enter Carter Duncan (Ealy), a handsome, charming stranger whose path keeps crossing with Leah's. Caring and solicitous of Leah and her family and friends, (Dutton, Wesley, Morris) their relationship rapidly progresses. It seems Leah has met The Perfect Guy. But if it seems too good to be true \u2026 soon his protective nature morphs into something more sinister. It's clear Leah has to end this new relationship and when she does, her onetime lover becomes her ultimate enemy.

The Temperance Movement, which had many women in its ranks, first urged the moderation of alcohol\u00a0 and then ultimately complete prohibition of alcohol. Later during\u00a0Prohibition, the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol was illegal; however, there were many \"side effects\" of\u00a0Prohibition of alcohol, including the\u00a0many speakeasy bars (illegal drinking spots) that popped up. These speakeasy bars had unmarked doors that led to \"intoxication rooms.\" Some were swanky places with velvety interiors. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, a NYC mayor in the 1930s and 1940s,\u00a0once said, \"It is impossible to tell whether\u00a0Prohibition is a good or bad thing. It has never been enforced in this country.\"<\/p> <p>On this walking tour, we will stop and look at some of the symbols of the Temperance Movement in the 19th Century as well as talk about Prohibition speakeasy bars and the rise and fall of Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s. During this tour, we'll also stop outside of four\u00a0faux speakeasy bars that are named after something to do with either the Temperance Movement in the 19th Century or Prohibition of alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s.<\/p> <p>The tour will end at 6th street and Avenue A in the East Village. However, there is then an option\u00a0to go inside a speakeasy bar that was the site of an actual speakeasy bar during Prohibition. This speakeasy bar, where gangsters once had meetings, has\u00a0the d\u00e9cor and a number of interesting artifacts from the Prohibition days of the 1920s and early 1930s. So, for those who want to, we'll walk several blocks south (from the East Village to the Lower East Side) to this speakeasy bar, which is near Delancey Street and Norfolk Street. We will walk through a long dimly-lit tunnel and then go inside.<\/p> <p><b>This is a walking tour with much commentary.\u00a0We'll be walking about 2 1\/2\u00a0miles. There will be plenty of stopping at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you. The tour lasts about 2 1\/4 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p>Below is an old photo of a slogan for the Temperance movement in the late 19th century.\u00a0This\u00a0photograph was taken in Thomas Edison's\u00a0movie studio at West Orange, NJ.\u00a0<i>(Source US\u00a0 Interior Dept., Nat'l Park Service, Thomas Edison Nat'l Historic Site)<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/f\/2\/600_439883794.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Below is\u00a0an article from <i>The New York Times<\/i>, August 26, 1887.

Their 17th album, The Nields - XVII,<br\/>is both their most personal and their most community minded. Well<br\/>into their third decade as a musical partners and judging by this sublime<br\/>album at the very top of their game, the Nields turn to meditations<br\/>on time, and turning points, their roots and community - both<br\/>musical and personal - but they also express joy in the present, faith in<br\/>the future, and a whole lot of hope and promise. The Nields' albums<br\/>are often an eclectic mix of ideas and music styles, but clear themes<br\/>emerge. Love and China (2002) was about the fragility of love and<br\/>relationships. The Full Catastrophe (2012) explored the messy experience<br\/>of raising a family. XVII has the Nields looking out from midlife, focusing on themes of time, love and community. The primary inspiration behind XVII was Nerissa and Katryna's hero, Pete Seeger, who died in January of 2014. His love of sharing music and his passion for justice had been a part of their lives since before they were born (their parents fell in love at a Pete Seeger concert). His death affected them profoundly.<br\/>Pete is clearly on the album in songs like \"Joe Hill\" and \"Wasn't That a Time,\" but the entire album is infused<br\/>with his spirit. It's there in the Nields' delight in sharing music and in using it to build a community. And it's<br\/>there in the title XVII: when compared to a career and life like that of Pete Seeger, they're not even out of<br\/>their teens.<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ourtimescoffeehouse.org\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ourtimescoffeehouse.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ourtimescoffeehouse.org\/<\/a>.<\/a><br\/>Doors open at 7:15 PM and the show starts at 8 PM.<br\/>Tickets: Adults $20, Students (w\/school I.D.) $10, Children (under 12) $6.

Unique in style and performance, Novella has carved her own niche as an artist who straddles soul-bossa jazz, marrabenta-bossa, and up beat Afro-soul to create a sound that Novella calls \u201cpop-world soul.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2ZX6PPHIOAg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/2ZX6PPHIOAg<\/a><\/p> <p>For more information: <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/kdv0JH\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/kdv0JH<\/a><\/p> <p>This concert is a part of World Music Institute\u2019s Lusophone Festival, a cross-cultural festival of artists from the Portuguese-speaking world.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/salsanewyork\/events\/225371283\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":21600000,"name":"15% DISCOUNT African Salsa Concert, Ricardo Lemvo and Makina Loca","id":"225371283","time":1442628000000,"updated":1442651531000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1219086006000,"name":"Salsa New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1261788,"urlname":"salsanewyork","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Salsa New Yorker"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"292 Graham Ave","name":"Action Burger","lon":-73.944008,"id":22635272,"lat":40.712231,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.55804038048,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438343731000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Karaoke &amp; Anime Night at Action Burger. \u00a0We will sing Karaoke on the xbox 360 and watch some anime. \u00a0Please vote on which Anime you'll like to watch. \u00a0Anime show or movie will be announced in the comments each week. \u00a0These are the Anime shows we have:<\/p> <p>Gurreen Lagann, Tokyo Ghoul, Rosario &amp; Vampire, Parasite - the Maxim.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Soon, you will notice a sign which points the way to an Indian shelter, believed to have been used by the Native Americans during their hunting season. The trail steeply ascends a rock outcrop, then descends through mountain laurel. In 0.3 mile, the Cannonball Trail, marked by a white \"C\" on red, joins from the left, and both trails proceed north on a wide woods road.<\/p> <p>In another half a mile, the trails cross a stream in a wet area and emerge from the woods near Skyline Drive, where they pass to the right of a fenced-in structure for a gas pipeline in an open area. Continue ahead, following the yellow and red trails as they pass through a boulder barrier and reenter the woods.<\/p> <p>In another 0.4 mile, the red-on-white-blazed Matapan Rock Trail crosses. Turn left and follow this trail for about 500 feet to its end at Matapan Rock. This rock ledge, which directly overlooks Skyline Drive below, affords an expansive view to the west.<\/p> <p>After resting here for a bit, retrace your steps to the main trail, turn left, and proceed north along the joint Hoeferlin\/Cannonball Trail, which immediately crosses a wide gravel road (which leads ahead to a radio tower). The trails soon bear left, ascending to the ridgeline, and passing a large glacial erratic to the right. Upon reaching the ridgeline, the trails turn sharply right onto an old woods road.<\/p> <p>A quarter of mile beyond, the two trails split. Bear right and follow the white-on-red-blazed Cannonball Trail as it descends from the ridge. The trail passes through a boulder field and, in another three-quarters of a mile, turns left onto a woods road. Here, the green-tulip-tree-leaf-on-white-blazed Old Guard Trail joins brielfy. When the trails split, bear left, continuing to follow the white-C-on-red blazes of the Cannonball Trail. You are now following\u00a0 the route of the historic Cannonball Road, reputed to have been used by the colonists during the Revolutionary War to transport munitions without being intercepted by the British.<\/p> <p>In another quarter mile, after once again crossing the Old Guard Trail, you'll pass a 25-foot-square abandoned concrete structure (probably an old cistern) to the right. You've now entered Boy Scout Camp Yaw Paw.<\/p> <p>About 900 feet beyond the concrete ruin, you'll notice a triple yellow-blaze to the right.\u00a0(If you come to a small log lean-to on the right side of the white-on-red trail, you've gone too far, and you should retrace your steps for 100 feet to find the yellow blazes.) Turn right onto the Yellow Trail, which immediately passes the camp's Dogwood Cabin and descends to cross a stream and a wet area on wooden planks. It joins a woods road and crosses a gas pipeline and then a stream. About half a mile from the start of the trail, the orange-blazed Schuber Trail joins from the left, and both trails begin a steady climb.<\/p> <p>At the crest of the ridge, the trails bear right and head south. Soon, the green-tulip-tree-leaf-on-white Old Guard Trail begins to the right, but you should continue ahead, following the yellow and orange blazes. At the highest point on the ridge (elevation 996 feet), the orange-blazed Schuber Trail leaves to the right. Here, you should head left to a rock outcrop which offers an outstanding view over northern Bergen County, with the Manhattan skyline visible on the horizon to the right. This is a good place to take a break.<\/p> <p>When you're ready, continue south on the Yellow Trail, which now begins to descend. After passing a stone foundation on a rock ledge, the trail comes to a T-intersection with a woods road. Turn right onto the road, briefly joining the Yellow-Silver Trail, but, in 100 feet, turn left and continue to follow the solid yellow blazes along a footpath. The Yellow Trail passes the stone foundations of some old Scout buildings, crosses a stream, climbs to the crest of the rise, then descends steadily through a wooded valley.<\/p> <p>After passing a huge, flat-sided boulder, the trail turns right onto an old woods road and levels off. Soon, it reaches a junction with the white-blazed Millstone Trail. Turn left, now following both yellow and white blazes, and descend to cross two branches of Fox Brook on wooden bridges.<\/p> <p>The trails now climb to cross paved Midvale Mountain Road, then continue to climb through the woods on a winding footpath. Soon, you'll notice a millstone in nearly perfect condition to the left of the trail. This area was once the site of a millstone quarry, and the stones that you see were damaged during quarrying or abandoned when the quarry operation shut down. After crossing an old woods road and climbing a little further, you'll pass several more abandoned millstones in various stages of completion.<\/p> <p>Just beyond, the white-blazed Millstone Trail goes off to the right, but you should proceed ahead, continuing to follow the Yellow Trail. The trail soon crosses several stone walls and begins a steady descent. On the way down, you can see the eastern ridge of the Ramapo Mountains through the trees, and the New York City skyscrapers may be visible on the horizon on a clear day.<\/p> <p>Towards the base of the descent, the trail bears right, leaving the eroded woods road that it has been following, and continues on a footpath. It crosses a stream on rocks (with an attractive cascade to the right), parallels another stream, then bears left to cross it.<\/p> <p>The trail now climbs rather steeply. At the top of the rise, a municipal water tower may be seen just ahead. After passing a viewpoint over Todd Lake from a rock ledge to the left, the trail descends to the lake. It passes another ledge (with a stone wall) at water level, with a view over the lake, and continues to parallel the lake. Near the lake's south end, the Yellow Trail turns right and soon ends at a woods road, the route of the white-blazed Todd Trail.<\/p> <p>Turn right, now following the white blazes. After another woods road joins from the left, the Todd Trail turns left and follows a footpath into the woods. It climbs gradually, descends to a shallow ravine, then ascends on a winding, rocky footpath, with several switchbacks.

Samaritans supporters, former volunteers, those who have utilized our services as well as friends, spouses and co-workers (last year there were even a few parents who brought their young children in strollers) will gather together for some fresh air, friendly conversation and a good meal--All to help raise needed funds for Samaritans 24-hour hotline, survivor support groups and suicide public education program.<\/p> <p>As with similar events, walkers create their own fundraising pages to encourage their friends, family members and others to become their Walkathon sponsors, requesting they support you in this cause by donating $25, $50, $100 or whatever they can.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2015<\/p> <p>\n\n\"I have tried many different forms of meditation and yoga over the years. Though I have experienced some positive changes practicing over the years I never felt committed to practice on regular basis. Nan takes it to a whole other level. How and why? All I can say is you have to experience it for yourself. There is power in simplicity,love, and truth. Despite some language barriers(which are minor) You can feel her love and healing energy. Open your mind and see with a different set of eyes. I highly recommend her special Saturday classes.\" Michelina, Bodhi Meditation class Saturday November 15, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201c\u00a0My first time today. Nan is very helpful and dedicated.

I'll have a P Flag visible and a cooler on wheels. You can shop with the group or branch off and do your own thing. We'll then meet back at the booth at 11:30am. If anyone needs more time, they can continue shopping and meet us in the park. Jon is a Certified Health Coach (www.bkhealthcoach.com) so if it's you first time at the market, let him know and he'll give you a tour of the market and help you shop.<\/p> <p><b>PICNICKING (11:45am-1:00pm)<\/b><\/p> <p>Everyone is invited to come picnic in the northern section of Prospect Park (see map below &amp; look out for the rainbow flags) which is a short walk from the market. I'll have some free food and drinks to munch on and you guys can share whatever you'd like with the group (no pressure at all). Will be a fun time to relax, hang out, chat, walk around, and do whatever's clever.<\/p> <p>I'll have a cooler in case you need to stash away milk or other cold foods you bought at the market.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/a\/9\/600_436117289.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet at the green grownyc.org info booth in the center of the market at 11:00am.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a
