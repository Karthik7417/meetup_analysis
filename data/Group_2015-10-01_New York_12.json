Depending on the sport of the day, one or two Dads will be responsible for keeping an eye on the kids for very short periods.  We will play with frequent substitutions to rotate playing and babysitting.

Shows are located at some of the top rock bars and small\/medium venues in the city. Selected events are curated by the group organizers.

Just by showing up and paying the entry free you are supporting a local musician or band. Typically cover charges go directly to a performing act once a minimum threshold has been met by the host venue. Due to the the vast amount of venues in NYC local bands may encounter audiences that are spread very thinly from venue to venue. By forming a group we can give selected local acts eager for new fans an opportunity to play for larger audience.<br><\/p>\n<p>In the future, Rock &amp; Effect NYC will be looking to partner with local music arts charitable organizations in combination with local venues to provide fundraising opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><b>How can I join the group?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Joining is easy.

Wine is as much an intellectual pursuit as it is a hedonistic one. There is no need for pretense.

The meat and dairy industries make you fat, sick, mean and fuck land, water and animals. Going vegan turns you into hot, healthy, compassionate Super &amp; Wonder moguls with brass knuckles who bring those industries to their knees. And don't worry -- we do it with fun and style, not with drippy, in-your-face, self-righteous militantism. En \"V\" yourself and have a good time doing it. That's the deal -- for $20, which you'll spend in the first half hour of bar and event hopping anywhere in NYC, you'll connect with and support plant-based power communities and meet over 100 very social, very fun health &amp; wellness-conscious professionals, eat and drink amazing vegan fare, hear incredible speakers, and party hard for an amazing cause.

It can be a slow, medium or fast dance and it can be danced to many different types of music.<br>The basic form of the dance is moderately challenging (compared to merengue) but it gives the opportunity to people to pick and choose an \"infinite\" amount of music to which to dance and makes it attainable for a large spectrum of age ranges and abilities. Best of all, West Coast Swing can adopt many movements and styles from other dances such as Salsa, Zouk, Hip Hop,...<\/p>\n<p>The number of people taking dance lessons and dancing West Coast Swing worldwide is increasing.

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit. You will be free to control your future because of your fitness level rather than being confined and restricted by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/highres_438394699.jpeg","photo_id":438394699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/600_438394699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/thumb_438394699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186822598,"name":"Jim Goldfuss"},"members":29,"name":"Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT)","id":18572613,"state":"NY","urlname":"Long-Island-Fitness-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430583604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"city-exploration","name":"city exploration","id":18942},{"urlkey":"explore-local-area","name":"Explore Local Area","id":30535},{"urlkey":"city-walks","name":"City Walks","id":113737},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-york-city","name":"Exploring New York City","id":131810}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/City-Explorers\/","rating":0,"description":"Group for those interested in walking around in the city in new places, discovering new things.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":115796622,"name":"Katie "},"members":346,"name":"City Explorers","id":18573217,"state":"NY","urlname":"City-Explorers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430585976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"small-business-online-marketing","name":"Small Business Online Marketing","id":84796},{"urlkey":"business-plans","name":"Business Plans","id":114893},{"urlkey":"winning-business-plans-and-strategies","name":"Winning Business Plans and Strategies","id":370031},{"urlkey":"business-plan-financials","name":"Business Plan Financials","id":923262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SCORE-NYC-Business-Mentoring-and-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"SCORE NYC offers affordable workshops in a wide range of small business topics.

We \"fall for\" the same kind of man over and over again and experience the same disappointments, the same hurts, the same hopelessness. We use a tremendous amount of energy dealing with these emotions instead of bringing our precious talents and beautiful spirits to the world. It is time to end this circle and move towards abundance that is available to all of us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Learn how to turn your wounds into tools of self exploration and self growth. Understand the patterns of your subconscious attractions in order to bring into your life more of what you desire.

You will also interact with others and have an opportunity to share your experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are all fighting the same battle for love and happiness.

I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F. Being able to work from anywhere in the world is one of the greatest benefits the Internet can provide for you.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>_______________<\/p> \n<p>Please join our group and meet us for social gatherings to share online marketing ideas, business opportunities, traffic generation techniques, or simply just to mastermind and socialize.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><i>\"To associate with other like-minded people in small purposeful groups is for the great majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction\"<\/i> ~ Aldos Huxley<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/highres_439170983.jpeg","photo_id":439170983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/600_439170983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/thumb_439170983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183873918,"name":"Meidee Lim"},"members":149,"name":"New York Online Business & Entrepreneurs Meetup","id":18583893,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Online-Business-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Online Marketers & Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431115527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Webinars\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To thrive in today's economy, you need knowledge.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned.

There are many forms of violence that we deal with, directly or indirectly, every day. Physical violence\/threats, racial violence and discrimination, sexual\/gender violence, and economic violence are probably the ones most clearly recognized, but there are more subtle forms as well (psychological, moral violence.) The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value. Recognizing the link between personal change and social change, The Community offers readings, exercise, and seminars that help us to align the way we think, feel and act, overcome the lack of meaning, and build a less violent and more human world.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10325289,"name":"Dennis Redmond"},"members":18,"name":"The Community of Nonviolence Sunnyside","id":18590121,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Community-of-Nonviolence-Sunnyside","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431367471000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"new-experiences","name":"New Experiences","id":34477},{"urlkey":"nyc","name":"NYC","id":39508},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"try-new-experiences","name":"Try New Experiences","id":278391}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hooplas\/","rating":0,"description":"Let's get together for affordable and fun events &amp; activities in New York City.

So working with the Moon provides us with an opportunity to take the time to create SACRED SPACE for ourselves. It\u2019s necessary. There is something so powerful when women come together to support each other on their journey, in the hopes and dreams. We are healed, we are nurtured, we feel comforted and understood. Moreover, when you share sacred space with other women, you magnify the power of your intentions and you energetically create a web of support for not only your circle of women friends but with women everywhere. There is no judgment or criticism present. We are able to listen wholeheartedly to what each woman has to say, holding her in support and compassion. A circle also allows that everyone within it, is equal. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honored, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.

Sometimes, a busy work week may prevent you from partaking in activities during the weekday so instead you prefer an excursion that is fun but yet inexpensive during the weekend. If this sounds like you, then perhaps this may be the group you've been looking for. Since I'm half tomboy meaning I like to hang up the heels from time to time so I can endure an exciting activity such as go karting, zip lining, and paint balling which allows me to act like a kid once awhile. Hey just because we're adults, that doesn't mean the fun have to stop! Right?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b><i>And since my personality is chill but mixed with hilarity (I like to laugh a lot, you'll see) it's only right if we embark on chill activities as well. How about one Saturday we laff together at a comedy club to the point our stomachs tighten up from all of the internal giggling, or have a weekend BBQ if the weather permits, then engage in a low key get-together with coolers devouring quality but inexpensive food while sharing laughter and stories with one another, and when we do want to put on the heels lets chill at a lounge, or even better lets enjoy a Sunday Brunch on a beautiful Sunday early afternoon. I am from Jersey City, however I am currently located in Trenton. So, I decided to base the group in New Brunswick to which is a centralized location to my North and Central Jersey Gurls.&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Please note our activities will be located throughout Northern, Central, South Jersey and sometimes the City (NY) and Philly as well to accommodate members closer to those referenced regions. My goal is to create a group that exemplifies REAL friendship, while embracing REAL fun that demonstrates REAL \"RESPECT\" amongst one another. This group is not for FLAKY women and only for those that are willing to establish a real connection with myself and others that are in this group. The group will be kept relatively small as I want to get to know you gurls and hopefully we all can benefit from establishing a real lasting friendship that goes beyond this group.&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>If you find yourself not able to attend an activity there is no need to select \"No\", if you can't attend. However, if you've have previously R.S.V.P. but are unable to attend at last minute just let me know. We all are human and other life circumstances will take precedence, I get it and completely understand. But, as a courtesy please alert me if you can't attend. I will dismiss those that are frequent offenders of the \"no show\", \"constant last minute cancels\", and \"no alerts\" as we're all adults, just be respectful of people's time and be conscious that it takes a lot of effort to coordinate the activities, as well as plan them. In addition, I will also dismiss members who have shown no interest in participating in any of the activities posted especially if&nbsp;you've been in the group for longer than two\/three months.&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>My goal is to weed out those that have no interest @ all in connecting and\/or engaging in activities, and keep those that are&nbsp;willing to have a connection and be active.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>With that said, I hope to meet you gurls real soon, and if the activities described above sounds like you, then come and join \"Us City Gurls\". \"&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>See you soon!&nbsp; <br><\/i><\/b><b><i>Daa'iyah<\/i><\/b><\/p>","lon":-74.4499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/9\/highres_438403337.jpeg","photo_id":438403337,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/9\/600_438403337.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/9\/thumb_438403337.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":145786602,"name":"Daa'iyah"},"members":25,"name":"\"Us City GuRls\"","id":18602568,"state":"NJ","urlname":"us-city-guRls","category":{"name":"women","id":35,"shortname":"women"},"lat":40.4900016785,"who":"City GuRls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431809546000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"money","name":"Money","id":15580},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"manifestation","name":"Manifestation","id":17449},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"wealth-building","name":"Wealth Building","id":22087},{"urlkey":"achieving-your-goals","name":"Achieving Goals","id":42319},{"urlkey":"cocreation-community-creative-expression-awareness","name":"Cocreation Community Creative Expression Awareness","id":56352},{"urlkey":"higher-consciousness-and-co-creation","name":"Higher consciousness and co-creation","id":99254},{"urlkey":"conscious-creative-community","name":"Conscious Creative Community","id":164667},{"urlkey":"mindfulness-creativity-and-innovation","name":"Mindfulness Creativity and Innovation","id":464222},{"urlkey":"embracing-your-eternal-power","name":"Embracing Your Eternal Power","id":1042152}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Burbank-Money-Manifesting-Circle-Workshop-The-Money-Bowl\/","rating":0,"description":"\"The Money Bowl\" Manifesting Circle &amp; Workshop.

Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering.

Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

To facilitate dinner-table discussions and to ensure that everyone is able to taste and retaste all the wines, attendance will be capped at 10 men per dinner.

BPD is a stressful condition that causes great pain in the sufferer as well as the people who are closest to him\/her.

Parents need to find ways to maintain their equilibrium in order to help their struggling children. Partners and spouses of people with borderline personality often question whether they should stay in their relationships. Children whose parents have this disorder have complicated issues that carry over into adulthood.

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying.

Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task). The team has since continued in its commitment to the community by following its mission to foster the well-being of women from all backgrounds and all ages.

Open to all ages, races, genders and cross-genders, nationalities, languages As long as you're interesting because you're interested in something that someone else might get excited about. Of course you're socially adept for conversation and exchange. Rules: Upload a real picture, Indicate your profession, Indicate lines of interest, Supply email address, Pay for your own drink.

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game. Good sportsmanship will be emphasized. &nbsp;I'll do my best to take this club in the direction that the majority of members seem to want to go. I'll often ask for member input into various happenings in the club and I'll be receptive to ideas and criticisms by members regarding the club. However, if I find that a member is acting in such a way as to disrupt club activities or ruin other member's enjoyment of the event, that member will be dismissed from the Club.<\/p>\n<p><i>Arbitration\/Disputes<\/i>: &nbsp;The GM will arbitrate all game related disputes and those decisions must be considered final.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Well, let me know if this plan seems good to you, or if you have any suggestions. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing from you. <br><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Sincerely Yours,<\/p>\n<p>Mark Abrams,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/111193673863924049303\/about\">Professional GameMaster Profile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>of<a href=\"http:\/\/professionalgamemastersociety.com\/\"> The Professional GameMaster Society<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/9\/600_438276857.jpeg\"><\/p>","lon":-73.7799987793,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2428395,"name":"Mark"},"members":1,"name":"Elthos Game Club","id":18650124,"state":"NY","urlname":"Elthos-Game-Club","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Elthosians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433510361000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Small-Business-Strategy-Meetup\/","rating":4.79,"description":"Every 2 weeks we will meet to discuss problems that plague business owners.

In this group, you'll do guided meditations, creative exercises, Haiku writing, and story-catching to get past your analytic mind and learned conventions and express your ideas more creatively from your spirit or intuition. To help you with this, I'll teach you the art of joriki, a Zen term for illuminating the light or spirit within and blending with the light of the source or spirit without. Learning to write from this place also helps you see the world from a more inspired and intuitive place, which in turn deepens the expression of your writing. <\/p>\n<p><b>This group has a heavy emphasis on spirituality, meditation, learning to live intuitively, and learning to connect with your own spirit from where your inspiration flows.<\/b> <b>It is not about manuscript critiquing or the business of publishing. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>About me: <\/b>I'm a a published author, an award nominated scriptwriter and journalist, with a career ranging from an Iraq War correspondent to lifestyle and spirituality feature writing. My work has been featured on BBC, NPR, McClatchy News and the Huffington Post. <\/p>\n<p>I combine my writing ability with these faculties to access the wisdom of the spirit to create work that is healing for me and for many around me. Using intuition to find that point of inspiration both inside and out in all circumstances has always been important in my work.<\/p>\n<p>Many people have been astonished with the originality and beauty of the work they have produced during these classes. While it can be intense, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and creative class. No writing experience is needed and sharing your writing with the group is entirely optional. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>A note on places:<\/b> (1) Places are limited to ensure everyone has the opportunity and attention needed to develop and explore your own inspiration and creativity.

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to.

The Christian Kirtan meetup group is going to exemplify the spirit of religious devotional chanting except using mainly Christian tunes and lyrics offset by instruments. However, the group will not be closed to spiritual fusion, or the incorporation of tunes from other cultures, such as Irish, French, or Indian, during rehearsal and performance. The main idea is to combine the Christian spirit and kirtan music, hopefully on a weekly basis, if not more often, throughout the year, whether outdoors or indoors in NYC. Later, when our members are consolidated, we can consider doing weddings and performing other events. We are going to experience the joy of kirtan, Christian-hearted, and then spread it to other people by setting a good example, loving our neighbors while disseminating peace, music, and spirituality.

All skill levels are welcome. <\/p>\n<p>I started the class from realizing that there were not many affordable yoga classes with small group setting, especially during the after work hours. Come join me on the mat to simply do vinyasa yoga in a state-of-the-art studio. The studio is conveniently located in Union Square area. The size of the class is always 10 yoga practitioners max. You will move and breath in carefully curated music. Mats and props will be provided. Towels and waters are not provided. The only thing I ask from you is to reserve your space early and avoid last minute cancellation so the space can be given to someone else. Just come wearing something that's comfortable enough to move in and you already have everything you need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the organizer:<\/strong> I am a yoga practitioner of 5 years and a 200hr Certified Yoga Instructor living and working in NYC. Outside of yoga, I have a full time job which I love and a supportive group of love ones so on most days I am happy. But just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can be overwhelming and difficult to manage sometimes. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share my practice with you. It is my way of paying it forward. <\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/highres_438570892.jpeg","photo_id":438570892,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/600_438570892.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/thumb_438570892.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9323786,"name":"Linh Lanh"},"members":128,"name":"New York Lavender Space Yoga Afterwork","id":18659774,"state":"NY","urlname":"LavenderSpace","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Yoga practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Larchmont","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433844348000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"pilates","name":"Pilates","id":3918},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"yoga-pilates-and-fitness","name":"Yoga, Pilates and Fitness","id":23768},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"mat-pilates","name":"Mat Pilates","id":51809},{"urlkey":"ballet-barre-method","name":"Ballet Barre Method","id":113478},{"urlkey":"barre-workout","name":"Barre Workout","id":688012},{"urlkey":"barre-fitness","name":"Barre Fitness","id":821922},{"urlkey":"ballet-barre-workout","name":"Ballet Barre Workout","id":821932},{"urlkey":"total-body-workout","name":"Total Body Workout","id":821942},{"urlkey":"barre","name":"Barre","id":997362},{"urlkey":"barre-classes","name":"Barre Classes","id":1367932}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Excel-Fitness-Mommy-Barre-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Welcome Barre Moms of all fitness levels!

Here's how this will work:<\/p>\n<p>1) A dinner theme for the event is proposed, a likely location provided. Location will be someone's home, or, perhaps, picnic in the park (all ideas welcome).<\/p>\n<p>2) Those interested in the theme sign up (RSVP).<\/p>\n<p>3) The organizer(s) comes up with the menu and dishes out responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>4) Want to attend but no time to cook? If there's room, maybe the organizer allows you to just bring some wine.<\/p>\n<p>5) We get together, share the food, make friends.<\/p>\n<p>This can be anything from potluck dinners to 12 course tasting menus. Probably not limited to dinners either. No rules!<\/p>\n<p>Open to all: from anyone who simply wants to learn how to cook and needs an excuse to practice to professional chefs.
