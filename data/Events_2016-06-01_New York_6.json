How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in NYC?<\/p> <p>We play 3 communication games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and what we have to offer so you can have the sex life and relationships that you really want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at this event are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

That land, where the life of the common man is cheap and reckless kings all-too-often burn their lives, and kingdoms, out in blazes of glory.<\/p> <p>The Korina Archipelago is home to several large city-states, each of which views the others as rivals, but generally coexist, for there are greater threats to their safety. Renegade Altameran privateers,\u00a0depraved nation-less pirates, demon-worshiping cannibals, horrors from the uncharted oceans, and far worse are reminders for the city-states of the constant dangers that exist outside their walls.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These dangers are all-too-real, and to whom can one turn to in times of desperation and need when threats arise? Each city-state will defend its own, but outside that, help is not easy to come by. Even the enlightened gods favor all, yet they favor none; those whose prayers and sacrifices are the most persuasive bend their ears for a time.

At once it conveys visions of countries without lines of demarcation, countries without imperial nationalism, and countries without boundaries we can protect. But that's mostly because most people just don't know much about what \"open borders\" really means or entails. So let's talk about it! Should our borders be open or closed? What would open borders even look like? Are open borders a threat to our national sovereignty or a necessity for operating as a humane country that's part of a globalized world? Yevgeniy Feyman from the Manhattan Institute will educate us on open borders from a philosophical and policy-based perspective.

Despite a great deal of existing research on modeling information diffusion and predicting success in social systems, these questions have remained largely unanswered for a variety of reasons. These reasons range from the inability to observe most word-of-mouth communication, to difficulties in precisely and consistently formalizing different notions of success.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This talk will attempt to clarify these issues through an empirical analysis of billions of diffusion events under one simple but unified framework. Jake will show that despite stable regularities in aggregate diffusion patterns, it remains surprisingly difficult to predict the success of any particular individual or piece of content in an online social network \u2013 with his best performing models explaining only half of the empirical variance in outcomes. He'll conclude by exploring this limit theoretically through a series of simulations that suggest that it is the diffusion process itself,\u00a0rather than our ability to estimate or model it, that is responsible for this unpredictability.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/3\/7\/600_449180023.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:<\/b><br\/>Jake Hofman is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research in New York\u00a0City, where his work in computational social science involves\u00a0applications of statistics and machine learning to large-scale social\u00a0data.

New wearable technologies are aggressively entering consumer applications (Fitbit, Skully, Apple Watch) but industrial safety equipment has not seen any fundamental innovation in the last decade.<\/p> <p>GuardHat addresses this issue with its \"smart hard hat ecosystem\", essentially an IoT device in a hard hat form factor. GuardHat is an industrial wearable that uses IoT and wireless communications systems to protect and empower industrial workers. By collecting and analyzing sensor-based data, GuardHat blends existing and emerging technologies to prevent safety incidents and to intervene more effectively when incidents happen.<\/p> <p>The GuardHat ecosystem includes a comprehensive Big Data software platform that gathers large volumes of sensor and M2M data, and analyzes this data stream in real-time using a Complex Event Processing engine to detect and act upon potential safety events. The architecture is modular and scalable to address future application integrations and flexibility in deployment. Reliability and performance are key, and the dynamic nature of the usage scenarios dictates the need for a rapid development toolset, all of which are addressed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hpccsystems.com\">HPCC Systems<\/a>.<\/p> <p>The GuardHat open platform can also deploy additional applications involving real-time access to the front line workforce. Preliminary analyses indicate that up to 20% of severe incidents could be prevented by GuardHat which is a potential market-value savings of $30-50 billion per year based on U.S. businesses incurring over $250 billion in annual safety related costs.<\/p> <p><b>Anupam Sengupta, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, GuardHat <\/b> Anupam is a co-founder and the CTO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.GuardHat.com\">GuardHat<\/a>.

What were the \u2018best\u2019 universities in the world in 2015? How do these results differ by ranking organization? This Shiny application attempts to explore these and other questions related to the 2015 world university rankings.<\/p> <p>2. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/JosephWang\/\">Cost of Living Estimator Between Cities<\/a><\/p> <p>By Joseph Wang<\/p> <p><br\/>In the past few years, I have traveled across the country as a\u00a0postdoctoral and industrial researcher. This is in part due to the harshness of the permanent academic environment, and also the down turn in the energy industry, especially back in my home town of Houston, Texas. The most immediately need for my\u00a0family is to look for a new job opportunity near an area which is affordable for long term living. It occurs to me that it would be great to have a Shiny application in R, which will be useful for people who want to or need to\u00a0relocate. My goal is to show some facts that may go against intuition about how things should work on the matter of cost of living standards and salary ranges in different cities. On the other hand, I also would like to examine if the income for data scientists is paid fairly according to living standards, and hopefully\u00a0make a suggestion on top cities for data scientists in terms of realistic aspects of life.<\/p> <p><br\/>3. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/Yannick_Kimmel\/\">Food and health demographics in the USA<\/a><\/p> <p>By Yannick Kimmel<\/p> <p><br\/>Obesity affects roughly 1 in 3 Americans, while diabetes affects roughly 1 in 10 Americans. The scope of this project is to explore the relationship of food and economic factors in the US' counties. Data was taken from the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. The diversity (or variance) of factors across counties allows for correlations in obesity rates to be developed. Users can map health indicators across the US, explore the relationship among different factors, and predict how changes in demographic factors will affect obesity rates.<\/p> <p><br\/>4. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/RobCastellano_Cultutal_Institutions_Map\/\">New York City Cultural Institutions<\/a><\/p> <p>By Robert Castellano<\/p> <p>Robert created a Shiny app that gives organizes the information of cultural institutions in New York.

(With the subtle activist mission of promoting veganism by showing people how much fun it can be.) In recent years we've done an occasional event that was directly an activist event, but these have been few and far between.<\/p> <p>While we are, and will continue to be, mostly a social group, we'd like to step up the number of activist events we do.<\/p> <p><br\/>This May 17th event will be outreach to the general public to promote and encourage a vegan diet &amp; lifestyle. We will hand out literature in a welcoming manner so our audience will be open to seeing how great the benefits of veganism are\u00a0for people, the non-human animals who share our world, and the planet itself.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will meet at the southwest corner of the park itself (East 14th Street and Union Square West, right on the corner of the park block) in Union Square at 6:30 pm (please arrive on time!). After a brief discussion on strategy and positioning of people, along with a few reminders for the group, we'll leaflet from 6:45 pm to 7:45 pm. Then our group will reassemble at the park corner and walk over to a nearby, all-vegan restaurant to have dinner, discuss our experiences and thoughts, and socialize.<\/p> <p>We know that not everyone in our group is vegan, but on this day we will be promoting veganism. You are very welcome to join us even if you are not yet 100% vegan, but please understand that the literature we will hand out will promote a purely vegan lifestyle. Mostly on this day you will be handing out literature rather than talking to people, but if you do happen to speak with people, we are promoting a vegan diet and lifestyle for\u00a0their tremendous benefits.<\/p> <p><b>Where to meet:<\/b> We will be meeting at the extreme southwest corner of Union Square Park, <b>where Union Square West meets East 14th Street. We'll meet on the actual park block, right on the corner. You will see us holding a \"VEG MEETUP\" sign.<\/b> We will meet right at 6:30pm. You may want to plan on being there early in order to be on time. Don't be late! We will talk for 15 minutes and then disburse to various nearby locations in the park.<\/p> <p><br\/>We believe that grass-roots activism is vital in advancing the ideal, practice, and potential normalization of veganism in our world. So let's come together and do this, and also have fun while doing it!<\/p> <p><br\/>Thank You All<\/p> <p>Saurabh Dalal and David Greene<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"How to find us: We will be meeting at the extreme southwest corner of Union Square Park, where Union Square West meets East 14th Street.

And yet it has been given me to serve whatever purpose I perceive in it. My mind can only serve. Today I give its service to the Holy Spirit to employ as He sees fit. I thus direct my mind, which I alone can rule. And thus I set it free to do the Will of God.<\/p> <p><i>Father, my mind is open to Your Thoughts, and closed today to every thought but Yours.

What were the \u2018best\u2019 universities in the world in 2015? How do these results differ by ranking organization? This Shiny application attempts to explore these and other questions related to the 2015 world university rankings.<\/p> <p>2. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/JosephWang\/\">Cost of Living Estimator Between Cities<\/a><\/p> <p>By Joseph Wang<\/p> <p>In the past few years, I have traveled across the country as a\u00a0postdoctoral and industrial researcher. This is in part due to the harshness of the permanent academic environment, and also the down turn in the energy industry, especially back in my home town of Houston, Texas. The most immediately need for my\u00a0family is to look for a new job opportunity near an area which is affordable for long term living. It occurs to me that it would be great to have a Shiny application in R, which will be useful for people who want to or need to\u00a0relocate. My goal is to show some facts that may go against intuition about how things should work on the matter of cost of living standards and salary ranges in different cities. On the other hand, I also would like to examine if the income for data scientists is paid fairly according to living standards, and hopefully\u00a0make a suggestion on top cities for data scientists in terms of realistic aspects of life.<\/p> <p>3. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/Yannick_Kimmel\/\">Food and health demographics in the USA<\/a><\/p> <p>By Yannick Kimmel<\/p> <p>Obesity affects roughly 1 in 3 Americans, while diabetes affects roughly 1 in 10 Americans. The scope of this project is to explore the relationship of food and economic factors in the US' counties. Data was taken from the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. The diversity (or variance) of factors across counties allows for correlations in obesity rates to be developed. Users can map health indicators across the US, explore the relationship among different factors, and predict how changes in demographic factors will affect obesity rates.<\/p> <p>4. <a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/bootcamp005_project\/Project2-Shiny\/RobCastellano_Cultutal_Institutions_Map\/\">New York City Cultural Institutions<\/a><\/p> <p>By Robert Castellano<\/p> <p>Robert created a Shiny app that gives organizes the information of cultural institutions in New York.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.

Some of us \"trash talk\" when we play, but it's all in good fun &amp; in the spirit of gaming.<\/p> <p>- This is a restaurant\/bar so accidents are bound to happen. However, if you're responsible for ruining someone else's game by spilling a beverage or food on it, the right thing to do is to offer to purchase a new copy for them. Some of the games we bring are out of print so please treat every board game with respect.<\/p> <p>- If a game is accidentally ruined by a staff member, everyone at the table should pitch in to buy a new one for the owner. More often than not, this comes to about $10\/person or less, so in our opinion it isn't too much to ask for.<\/p> <p>Thanks everyone &amp; see you on Tuesday night!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/431969846974239\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers\/events\/230686208\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Weekly Game Night at TGIF","id":"xpqtmlyvhbwb","time":1463526000000,"updated":1463542526000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355802481000,"name":"Forest Hills Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":6280132,"urlname":"Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Board Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"11211 Brooklyn","address_1":"232 North 12th Street","name":"Sottocasa Pizzeria","lon":-73.953064,"id":24132329,"state":"NY","lat":40.719269,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.87767076492,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451884529000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dear Friends,<\/p> <p>We are proud to announce that our conversation nights are back!!<\/p> <p>Starting on January 5t 2016, EVERY TUESDAY, we will get together to speak italian, make new friends, share your love for our beautiful language AND enjoy delicious food!<\/p> <p>Every Tuesday at 7pm<\/p> <p>@ Sottocasa WIlliamsburg<br\/>232 North 12th Street<br\/>11211 Brooklyn,NY NEW YORK ITALIANS SPECIAL:<br\/>Complimentary Focaccia!<\/p> <p>For information and RSVP email us:<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>Grazie!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyork-italians-org\/events\/230953506\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Italian Conversation and Aperitivo!","id":"gsfknlyvhbwb","time":1463526000000,"updated":1463537683000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1281671700000,"name":"NEW YORK ITALIANS","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1690232,"urlname":"newyork-italians-org","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"44 Charlton St. ","name":"The Greene Space at WNYC\/WQXR","lon":-74.004997,"id":18096922,"state":"NY","lat":40.727062,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.77240371704,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462476683000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/1\/1\/600_449672529.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join NYC 50+ Let's Get Social as we mourn and celebrate the life and music of Prince.<\/p> <p>Prince transformed how we understand music.

There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t.\u00a0 Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not.\u00a0 Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

However, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You\u2019re introducing someone else\u2019s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Each component may have vulnerabilities (~14% of them do), be compromised, or even be outright malicious. Multiply that risk by hundreds of dependencies, and you have a recipe for disaster.<\/p> <p>Guy will demonstrate how you can mitigate this risk without losing productivity. We will also share data about risk, show how to find and fix known vulnerabilities in these dependencies, discuss how to prioritize the ones worthy of manual inspection, and suggest what to monitor in production.<\/p> <p>Guy Podjarny (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/guypod\">@guypod<\/a>) is a cofounder at Snyk.io focusing on the security risk in your dependencies.

You're welcome to join us at one of our free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena. IAC is an educational and research centered organization in the area of consciousness studies, human potential and psychic development, and has offices in over 12 countries worldwide.<\/p> <p>How do I attend?<\/p> <p>Confirm via meetup that you're attending or email us to register at [masked].<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"59th and Lex subway is closest.

These efforts will enable organizations to step up their software security game and identify hurdles by using OpenSAMM as a powerful benchmarking tool. John will provide details on an ongoing industry effort to improve OpenSAMM by providing more comparative data to encourage broader use throughout industry.<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>8:00pm - Session 2<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Chapter News Globally and Locally with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tombrennan\">Tom Brennan<\/a>\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022<b>\u00a08:15pm - Session 3 -\u00a0Security Automation in Agile SDLC - Real World Cases<\/b>\u00a0with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ofermaor?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=3ZoW&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A1372871%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1461360159016%2Ctas%3Aofer%20ma\"><b>Ofer Maor<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>How can we really automate secure coding?

To help organizations combat and mitigate this threat, the OWASP Anti-Ransomware Guide was developed to provide organizations a defense in depth roadmap of the controls that can be used to protect against ransomware. This presentation will serve to introduce the guide and its contents to the OWASP community as well as take a more in depth look at how conducting mock incidents can be of key importance to ensuring successful mitigation and remediation of a mass malware outbreak. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>=============================================\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Special thanks to our venue host\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyi.net\/\"><b>New York Internet<\/b><\/a>\u00a0and to our meeting sponsors\u00a0<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www8.hp.com\/us\/en\/software-solutions\/enterprise-security.html?\">Hewlett Packard,<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.netspi.com\/\">Netspi<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protiviti.com\/en-US\/Pages\/default.aspx\">Protiviti<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.synopsys.com\">Synopsys<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.denimgroup.com\/\">Denim Group<\/a>\u00a0<\/b>and\u00a0all of our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/owaspnycmetro\/sponsors\/\"><b>local chapter supporters.\u00a0<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Please help us to continued to raise visibility by supporting our Chapter by becoming an OWASP Member. \u00a0<b>Join or renew your membership,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.owasp.org\/index.php\/Membership\">click here<\/a>.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Help raise visibility for your company. \u00a0Discuss the opportunities with them of\u00a0<b>becoming a\u00a0Local Chapter Supporter<\/b>. \u00a0For more information,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/2461862\/2016%20Sponsor%20Guidelines%20Flyer.pdf\"><b>click here<\/b><\/a>.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If you have any questions or need any additional information, please contact Dawn Aitken, Program Manager at [masked] or[masked]-6186.<\/p> <p>=============================================<\/p> <p><i>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits\/Charitable-Organizations\/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501(c)(3)-Organizations\">501(c)(3)<\/a>worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software.

Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good.

This becomes all the more necessary when processing live data streams where maintaining SLA is paramount. Furthermore, multiple different computations make up an application and each of them may have different partitioning needs. Partitioning also needs to adapt to changing data rates, input sources and other application requirements like SLA.<\/p> <p>In this talk we will introduce how Apex, a distributed data-in-motion platform on Hadoop, handles partitioning. We will look at different partitioning schemes provided by Apex some of which are unique in this space. We will also look at how Apex does dynamic partitioning, a feature unique to and pioneered by Apex to handle varying data needs with examples. We will also talk about the different utilities and libraries that Apex provides for users to be able to affect their own custom partitioning.<\/p> <p>Presenters:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Pramod Immaneni\u00a0Apache Apex PMC member, and architect at DataTorrent Inc, where he works on Apex and big data applications.

This becomes all the more necessary when processing live data streams where maintaining SLA is paramount. Furthermore, multiple different computations make up an application and each of them may have different partitioning needs. Partitioning also needs to adapt to changing data rates, input sources and other application requirements like SLA.<\/p> <p>In this talk we will introduce how Apex, a distributed data-in-motion platform on Hadoop, handles partitioning. We will look at different partitioning schemes provided by Apex some of which are unique in this space. We will also look at how Apex does dynamic partitioning, a feature unique to and pioneered by Apex to handle varying data needs with examples. We will also talk about the different utilities and libraries that Apex provides for users to be able to affect their own custom partitioning.<\/p> <p>Presenters:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Pramod Immaneni\u00a0Apache Apex PMC member, and architect at DataTorrent Inc, where he works on Apex and big data applications.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

Her co-director, Pitr Strait (<i>Henry IV.1<\/i>,<i>The Skriker<\/i>), is a veteran of Central Park Shakespeare, having directed\u00a0<i>Two Gentlemen of Verona<\/i>\u00a0and a previous production of\u00a0<i>The Tempest<\/i>, and a long-time collaborator of Ms. Mottola's.<\/p> <p>With Summit Rock (the highest natural elevation in Central Park) for a stage, this\u00a0<i>Tempest<\/i>\u00a0focuses on the contrast between the harsh restrictions of \"civilization\"\u2014where political maneuvering costs thrones and lives\u2014and the Edenic, magic-suffused tropical island on which the sorcerer Prospero and his daughter Miranda have lived in exile for twelve years. The contrast will be dramatized not only through performance and staging but also through inventive and integral use of costuming, with the harrowed, conspiring shipwreck victims initially forced to navigate the play\u2019s island setting in constricting outfits suggestive of European aristocracy, in striking contrast to Prospero\u2019s open and airy conjurer\u2019s mantle, Miranda\u2019s guileless, naked innocence, and the winged, painted form of the fairy Ariel.<\/p> <p>\u201c<i>The Tempest<\/i>\u00a0is one of Shakespeare\u2019s best-known and best-loved plays, but we want the audience to see it through fresh eyes, as \u2018something rich and strange,\u2019 the way an audience four hundred years ago would have,\u201d said Ms. Mottola. A graduate of Barnard College with a degree in biology, Ms. Mottola's studies have also included acting, literature, and computer science. \u201cTo this end, we are very excited to make organic use of the natural resources we have: this beautiful natural setting in Central Park and the natural forms of our performers.\u201d<\/p> <p>The play\u2019s selective use of nudity to dramatize\u00a0<i>The Tempest<\/i>'s central themes of alienation and reconciliation builds on a long tradition of free expression in theatrical productions held in outdoor settings. Past productions performed in Central Park, including\u00a0<i>Hair<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Henry V,<\/i>\u00a0have featured full nudity in a similarly artistic, non-sexual context. Furthering that tradition, Mottola and Strait use nudity to communicate a broader message about body freedom, equality and open-mindedness, born of the production\u2019s affiliation with one of the city\u2019s long-standing organizations devoted to these topics,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/coedtoplesspulpfiction.wordpress.com\/\">The Outdoor Co-Ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society<\/a>. The subject of profiles in the<i>New York Times<\/i>, the Sunday\u00a0<i>Times<\/i>\u00a0of London, the\u00a0<i>Village Voice<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Salon<\/i>, the\u00a0<i>Huffington Post<\/i>,<i>Cosmopolitan<\/i>, and elsewhere, OCTPFAS has worked for more than five years to educate the public about their legal rights and to change attitudes about non-sexual exposure of the human body.<\/p> <p>\"In nearly all of his plays, Shakespeare touched in one way or another on the collision between old and new, ordinary and radical,\" said Strait, a graduate of Columbia as well as The New School for Drama. \"His final play is no exception. Because of that,\u00a0<i>The Tempest<\/i>\u00a0will always speak to an audience ready for new ideas. We hope our audience will leave our\u00a0<i>Tempest<\/i>\u00a0as transformed as our characters.\"<\/p> <p>The production will feature a cast of eight actors, three dancers, and two musicians, with costume design by Delcey Fleming, body paint by Andy Golub, and assistant direction by Sarah Itzkoff.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Directions to Summit Rock from 81st Street and Central Park West (Summit Rock is also accessible from the 85th Street entrance).<\/i><\/p> <p><i>1) Enter the park at 81st Street and Central Park West, on the uptown side of 81st Street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>2) Follow the road past the Diana Ross playground on your left, and keep bearing left.

Spark can read from diverse data sources and scale to thousands of nodes.<\/p> <p>The lecture will be followed by demo . There will be a short lecture on Hadoop and how Spark and Hadoop interact and compliment each other.

Thus, it would not\u00a0be okay to just update the database this Sprint, and finish the UI and\u00a0control layers in next Sprint. Nor would it be okay to code this\u00a0Sprint and test in the next. But what if your requirements and\u00a0features are too large to fit all the work in a Sprint?<\/p> <p>Story splitting to the rescue. Let's explore together how we could do\u00a0that for some challenging stories or bring in a sample from\u00a0your own backlog! Pick one that your Team is having trouble making\u00a0smaller - let's slice it in this workshop.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Short Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scrumalliance.org\/community\/profile\/pheiramo\">Petri Heiramo<\/a> is an experienced Agile trainer and coach. Certified by Scrum Alliance as a Certified Scrum Trainer in 2008, he has since trained a few thousand people as CSMs and CSPOs, in organisations ranging from small companies and startups, to multinational giants worldwide.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Petri sees Agile as a holistic approach for business success. It's not just the teams; it's the culture and behavior of the whole organisation. All levels and aspects of the organisation should embrace the mindset, and then find the effective ways in which they can all work together to a shared goal. This is obviously easier said than done, particularly in large existing companies. Therefore it is important to remain practical in the adoption of Agile.<\/p> <p><b>Agenda:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>6:00 \u2013 6:30 PM -Free Pizza &amp; Networking<\/p> <p>6:30 \u2013 7:00 PM-\u00a0Welcome and Update on our group initiatives:<\/p> <p>Big Apple Scrum Day 2016 \u2013 Dana Pylayeva<\/p> <p>Mentorship program \u2013 Jim Dermend \/Kate Hana<\/p> <p>7:00 PM \u2013 8 PM -\u00a0Thou Shalt Split Thine User Stories -\u00a0<\/p> <p>a workshop with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scrumalliance.org\/community\/profile\/pheiramo\">Petri Heiramo<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Scrum-User-Group\/events\/229005778\/","yes_rsvp_count":92,"duration":7200000,"name":"Thou Shalt Split Thine User Stories","id":"nzmjnlyvhbzb","time":1463695200000,"updated":1463758710000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446826951000,"name":"NYC Scrum User Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19096407,"urlname":"NYC-Scrum-User-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Agilists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"51 West 14TH ST, Suite 3R","name":"PhotoManhttan","lon":-73.99584,"id":1499615,"state":"NY","lat":40.737255,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":0.934058487415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":18,"created":1463114608000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us\u00a0for our Digital Camera Workshop!

We are not accepting any more players at this time. Feel free to message me and I can reach out if a spot opens up in the future.<\/p> <p><br\/>INTRODUCTION:Until just days ago, most members of our party were blissfully unaware of the Keys of Power and their creator, the Aramago. Even those that had any inkling of these topics thought the stories they\u2019d heard to be mere legends. Then one of the Keys of Power was almost literally dropped in their lap. They were suddenly running for their lives guarding Melrick, the courier ferrying that item to a safe place.<\/p> <p><br\/>Now, Melrick is dead and the party is cast adrift in an alien realm of existence. What\u2019s worse, they\u2019ve been separated from more than half of their number with seemingly no hope to reunite with them. So Theron, Clovis, and Drom cast about for ways to return to their home plane, reunite with their comrades, and most importantly, convey the precious cargo they carry to its rightful place.<\/p> <p><br\/>However, all is not lost. Potential new allies have stepped forward. Already the elven ranger Thamior has shown his worth by warning the party of an impending ambush and nearly dying in helping to fight it off. And he\u2019s introduced them to two more he knows can be trusted once the four of them reach the tiny village they hope will be a safe haven. They have just begun to relax for a\u00a0much-needed\u00a0warm meal when a gypsy strolls into the tavern and engages them directly with a desperate plea for help.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. It is a shell that encompasses the numerous, separate adventures the players will enjoy during an\u00a0epic\u00a0quest to recover all the Keys of Power.<\/p> <p><br\/>This game is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month.

We're happy to help newcomers along with how to play, as well as how to plan strategies to win the games. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Our event is every Thursday night at Dave &amp; Buster's in Westbury Long Island from 6:30pm to 10:30pm. \u00a0You can leave prior to 10:30pm if you want, also please note that Dave &amp; Buster's closes at Midnight for those who want to stay later.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most people arrive at 6:30pm. \u00a0We use the first 30 minutes to talk, order food\/drinks, and pick out games while we wait for any people that are a little late. \u00a0Promptly at 7pm we split into groups and play our games that typically take 2 hours to play. \u00a0So, if you arrive after 7pm there is a good chance that you will not be able to get into a game and can watch us play if you'd like. \u00a0At the end of the night we play a couple of additional shorter games that you can get into.<\/p> <p>This group meets in the Large Dining Room at the table directly in front of the wall with 9 Big Screen TV's (We are located 1 room over from the pool tables). \u00a0There is no cover charge to enter Dave &amp; Buster's and plenty of parking is available. Also, there is no fee to join this meetup group. All that management at Dave &amp; Buster's asks is that each person purchase $5 off their menu (it can be 1 appetizer, or 1 dessert, or a few sodas, basically whatever you choose). \u00a0<\/p> <p>Plenty of board games will be present at this event, but feel free to bring some of your favorites. Some of the games that we play are Kingsburg,\u00a0Stone Age,\u00a0Lords of Waterdeep,\u00a0Istanbul, Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Love Letter Batman, Splendor,\u00a0Pirate's Cove,\u00a0Five Tribes, Castles of Burgundy,\u00a0and more. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Here is a list of the board games I own on the BGG website:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/MarkNY8?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/MarkNY8?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/MarkNY8?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Here is a list of Co-Host Kenny's games on BGG:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/kenk1982?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/kenk1982?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/collection\/user\/kenk1982?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Looking forward to meeting you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mark<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This group meets in the Large Dining Room at the table directly in front of the wall with 9 Big Screen TV's.
