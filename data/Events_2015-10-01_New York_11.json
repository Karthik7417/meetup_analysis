He is a vivid example of Integral-in-Action.\u201d<\/p> <p>Amir\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.integrallife.com\/ken-wilber-dialogues\/isis-crisis-modernity\">video dialogue\u00a0with Ken Wilber\u00a0on\u00a0Integral Life<\/a> and his <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1lDXzkX\">article on Medium<\/a>\u00a0provided the inspiration for our January 2015 Meetup, in which we looked at ISIS through the Integral lens.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/d\/8\/600_441395288.jpeg\" \/> Amir is a writer, educator, and storyteller, and is the formerly anonymous Arab Spring activist behind the internationally acclaimed sociopolitical blog\u00a0<b><i>The Sudanese Thinker<\/i><\/b>, which inspired the rise of the Sudanese digital activism scene.\u00a0In 2013 when he was 26, Amir\u2019s first book was released, the memoir\u00a0<b><i>My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind \u2013 And Doubt Freed My Soul<\/i><\/b>. It was subsequently banned in Sudan and Malaysia, which forced him to seek political asylum in Canada. It was also selected as one of\u00a0<i>Foreign Policy<\/i>\u2019s top 25 books to read in 2013.\u00a0 Amir has been described by the Economist as \u201cpuckish,\u201d and by WIRED as a \u201cformidable speaker.\u201d<\/p> <p>Amir will speak about his personal transformation, as he wrote in his book - growing up in Qatar, exposed to unhealthy fundamentalism, believing he should suppress his curiosity, at the same time being moved by the beauty of the Muslim call to prayer and experiencing a blissful oneness studying the Koran and spending time at the mosque. \u00a0Then, his family moved to Malaysia in his teen years, and Amir found himself in a liberal British high school - sorting through Eastern and Western influences. In college, he encountered Google and bloggers, one of whom encouraged him to blog about his experience \u2013 and his writing ultimately emerged as his memoir.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He will speak to us about Islam and Integral, and there will be plenty of time for questions and dialogue.<\/p> <p>Amir sees an evolving Islam \u2013 both in people\u2019s hearts as well as externally \u2013 which is responding to environmental changes both in demographics and a changing media landscape (the internet, Twitter, YouTube, etc.).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our evening together is sure to be stimulating and lively.<\/p> <p>To quote Terry Patten again, \u201cI think you\u2019ll be inspired to hear Amir\u2019s sober but fierce optimism about the evolution of consciousness in the Muslim world.\u201d \u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Many thanks to Nomi Naeem, who reached out to Amir after our January Meetup and provided the link to make this event possible. <\/i><\/p> <p>\u201c<i>My Isl@m<\/i>\u00a0is an important and significant book, especially at this time in our history. Amir shows both the downside and, as important, the beautiful upside of Islam as a religion, particularly when it is viewed through an Integral lens, which is how religion in general will need to be viewed if it is to survive into the future as a positive force.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

You cannot make or take phone calls while you're in a meeting. You can do the filing of paperwork sitting on your desk while you're away on vacation.

You defer that next-action to later...and that's the premise of the GTD concept of Someday-Maybe. But, as anyone who has implemented GTD can tell you, it's not that easy, is it? That's the focus on this GTD|REFRESH!<\/p> <p><br\/>We will be discussing how to implement Someday-Maybe systems for different contexts of life, how to manage your Someday-Maybe list(s) so it's not overwhelming or forgotten, and we'll answer each others' questions about when and when not to move items to or from active projects and next-actions to being a someday-maybe.<\/p> <p><br\/>I'm sure it's going to be a GTD|REFRESH series conversation for the GTD NYC Meetup, so I'm looking forward to discussing Somedays and Maybes with you all!<\/p> <p>Please feel free to bring your copy of GTD, your questions and thoughts on problem-solving as well!

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

They had passed their phases of immetalization, of plant and animal life, from the lowest to the highest, and were waiting for their human, more intelligent form. Yet, what could the plastic modellers do but follow the laws of evolutionary Nature? Could they, as claimed by the Biblical dead-letter, form \"Lord-God\"-like, or as Pygmalion in the Greek allegory, Adam-Galatea out of volcanic dust, and breathe a living soul into Man? No: because the soul was already there, latent in its Monad, and needed but a coating. Pygmalion, who fails to animate his statue, and Bahak-Zivo of the Nazarean Gnostics, who fails to construct \"a human soul in the creature,\" are, as conceptions, far more philosophical and scientific than Adam, taken in the dead-letter sense, or the Biblical Elohim-Creators. Esoteric philosophy, which teaches spontaneous generation \u2014 after the Sishta and Praj\u00e2pati have thrown the seed of life on the Earth \u2014 shows the lower angels able to construct physical man only, even with the help of Nature, after having evolved the ethereal form out of themselves, and leaving the physical form to evolve gradually from its ethereal, or what would now be called, protoplasmic model.\" (SD II, pg. 150)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Theosophywatch\/events\/225215985\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Theosophy Watch Meetup","id":"cftrhlytmblc","time":1443483000000,"updated":1443498747000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434389406000,"name":"Theosophy Watch","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18674676,"urlname":"Theosophywatch","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Students"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"73 8th Ave","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-74.002792,"id":23000942,"lat":40.739391,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":0.994969129562,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437939303000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I am a Spanish native speaker and suggest\u00a0we meet at Think Coffee to help you to\u00a0improve your\u00a0Spanish!<\/p> <p>There is a maximum of\u00a06 students per group and costs $10\/person.<\/p> <p>My phone number is[masked] just in case you cannot find me.<\/p> <p>Don\u00b4t sign up if you are not sure you can come.<\/p> <p>The lesson lasts 1 hour.<\/p> <p>Hasta pronto!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"73 8th Ave, New York, NY","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spanish-conversation-lessons-group\/events\/225215567\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"One hour Spanish conversation.

Kyle will also share tips on how to create sacred space at home and commit to a daily meditation routine.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencenter.org\/events\/the-path-of-kriya-yoga-the-teachings-of-yogananda\/\">Click Here<\/a> to sign up.<\/p> <p>If you mention you're with Ananda you can attend on a drop-in basis for $22 per class.<\/p> <p>A WEEKLY COURSE<br\/>(4 sessions) Tuesday, September 29\u2013October 20, 6\u20137:30pm<br\/>Members: $110 \/ Nonmembers: $120<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Ananda-NYC-Paramhansa-Yogananda-Meditation-Satsang\/events\/225511877\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"The Path of Kriya Yoga: The Teachings of Yogananda","id":"225511877","time":1443564000000,"updated":1443571001000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1345773426000,"name":"Ananda NYC Paramhansa Yogananda Meditation & Satsang","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":4627072,"urlname":"Ananda-NYC-Paramhansa-Yogananda-Meditation-Satsang","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Yogis"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"130 East 39th Street ","name":"Lexington Bar at the Court Hotel ","lon":-73.977852,"id":23982438,"state":"NY","lat":40.749447,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.63810390234,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442449465000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This may be the friendliest and most social After Work Happy Hour you will experience!

Apologies for the inconvenience. -Matt]<\/p> <p>Spark 1.5 was recently released. In this meetup, join TD, Patrick, Reynold from Databricks and Dean from Typesafe to talk about the latest release and what is coming next.<br\/>Many of the major changes in Spark 1.5 are under-the-hood changes to improve Spark\u2019s performance, usability, and operational stability. Spark 1.5 ships major pieces of Project Tungsten, an initiative focused on increasing Spark\u2019s performance through several low-level architectural optimizations. The release also adds operational features for the streaming component, such as backpressure support.

The challenges of the early-stage company, MotionTraxx, and tactics used by this month's growth company, Spotify, was very helpful in helping me extract lessons learned. In learning about practical approaches to product management, I'm able to better utilize my own product management toolbox to further develop an effective, productive and efficient product management system for our company.

They have Classic beer garden food on the menu and a long list of craft beers on tap. There will be a sitcom inspired trivia contest that will be relevant for all ages. The bar is on the Upper East Side between 83rd and 84th. Take the 4,5 or 6 or hop on the ever convenient M15 Select Bus.

Following this is adopting or creating one or more strategies to trade these instruments, and determining tactics to implement these strategies.<\/p> <p>Next in line is paper trading to gain comfort with your tactics, process and execution, then low position-size real money trading.

With systems such as Impala and Spark, analysts can now run complex queries or jobs over large datasets within a matter of seconds. With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets.<\/p> <p>Despite these advances, some important gaps remain that prevent many applications from transitioning to Hadoop-based architectures. Users are often caught between a rock and a hard place: columnar formats such as Apache Parquet offer extremely fast scan rates for analytics, but little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access. Online systems such as HBase offer very fast random access, but scan rates that are too slow for large scale data warehousing workloads.<\/p> <p>This talk will investigate the trade-offs between real-time transactional access and fast analytic performance from the perspective of storage engine internals. It will also describe <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cloudera.com\/blog\/2015\/09\/kudu-new-apache-hadoop-storage-for-fast-analytics-on-fast-data\/\">Kudu<\/a>, the new addition to the open source Hadoop ecosystem that fills the gap described above, complementing HDFS and HBase to provide a new option to achieve fast scans and fast random access from a single API.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br\/>Todd Lipcon is a Software Engineer at Cloudera and a PMC member of the Apache Hadoop and Apache HBase projects. He holds a Sc.B in computer science from Brown University, where he completed an honors thesis developing a new collaborative filtering algorithm for the Netflix Prize Competition.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/225571588\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytmbmc","time":1443565800000,"updated":1443579917000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424150422000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out and play some games, hang out, have fun and may be make some new friends.<\/p> <p>\n\nLeave a comment if you are bringing any games.

The ideas expressed here will remove from your consciousness any fear of so-called death.<\/p> <p>Reincarnation is one of the world's most disputed doctrine. The belief in reincarnation has had millions of intelligent, learned, and tolerant followers throughout the ages. Ringing through the minds and hearts of students, mystics, and thinkers have always been the words: \"Why Are We Here?\" Reincarnation has been criticized by some as conflicting with sacred literature and as being without verification. This book reveals, however, in an intelligent manner the many facts to support reincarnation.<\/p> <p>Quotations from eminent authorities, and from Biblical\u00a0and Sacred works substantiate reincarnation. It places it high above mere speculation. This book is without exaggeration the most complete, inspiring, enlightening book ever written on this subject. It is not a fiction story but a step-by-step revelation of profound mystical laws. Look at some of these thought-provoking, intriguing subjects: The Cosmic Conception; The Personality of the Soul; Does Personality Survive Transition?; Heredity and Inheritance; Karma and Personal Evolution; Religious and Biblical Viewpoints; Christian References; Between Incarnations; Souls of Animals and the \"Unborn\"; Recollections of the Past.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224384215\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry-Mansions of the Soul:Souls of Animals & \"the Unborn\"","id":"fpbtflytmbmc","time":1443565800000,"updated":1443578535000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"808 Columbus Ave,","name":"Whole Foods","lon":-73.966743,"id":21737572,"state":"NY","lat":40.794708,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":3.32679319382,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428802939000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We play the kind of rummy where once you lay down the cards, you and other players can move them around into different configurations.\u00a0 Each hand is quite long but it is more fun than gin rummy, which is over once your cards are down.\u00a0 If you want to practice before your first visit, you can download the software here:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/Romi\/3000-2647_4-10317463.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/Romi\/3000-2647_4-10317463.html<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe also enjoy playing Oh Hell, which is easy to learn, but hard to win!\u00a0 We need 3 players minimum for this.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk past the checkouts to where the tables are set up to eat.

And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Thur\/Fri) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket\u00a0 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to driver there in advance if you want seats near us. OR you can just show up that night and sit wherever there is space available.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Hope to see YOU at the movies!!\u00a0 Love, Cassie<\/p> <p><b><i>if you can't make it, no need to post why.

The appeal is obvious: you don't need to learn a new language, and you still have access to modules (pandas, nltk, statsmodels, etc.) that you are familiar with, but you are able to run complex computations quickly and at scale using the power of Spark.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will examine a real PySpark job that runs a statistical analysis of time series data to motivate the issues described above and provides a concrete example of best practices for real world PySpark applications. We will cover:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Python package management on a cluster using virtualenv.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Testing PySpark applications.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Spark's computational model and its relationship to how you structure your code.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Juliet is a Data Scientist at Cloudera, and contributor\/committer\/maintainer for the Sparkling Pandas project. Her commercial applications of data science include developing predictive maintenance models for oil &amp; gas pipelines at Deep Signal, and designing\/building a platform for real-time model application, data storage, and model building at WibiData.

It's a long way from a Python script on a laptop, to a fault-tolerant system that learns continuously, serves thousands of queries per second, and scales to terabytes.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

This September, our theme is \"Bad Medicine,\" which means we'll be bringing you five stories of medicine -- from dispensing it or selling it, to getting a taste of your own.<\/p> <p>Hosted by Erin Barker and Ben Lillie.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Neer Asherie<\/b> is a professor of physics and biology at Yeshiva University. He received a B.A. and M.A. in natural sciences (physical) from Cambridge University and a Ph.D. in physics from MIT. He was awarded grants from the National Science Foundation to support his research on the self-assembly of globular proteins. His articles have appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Physical Review Letters, and Crystal Growth and Design. In addition to his scientific publications, Neer has authored a novel and several short plays.<\/p> <p><b>Deena Walker <\/b>is a postdoctoral fellow at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine where she studies the molecular mechanisms of addiction and depression. She recently moved to New York after finishing her PhD at The University of Texas at Austin in December 2012. When she's not in lab she enjoys practicing yoga and playing fetch with her dog in Central Park.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Jimmy Wohl<\/b> is a writer and musician from New York City. He performs in many shows throughout the region, is the host of a travel storytelling show in Brooklyn called Get Outta Here!, and has published nonfiction in the New York Press (RIP). He's also a saxophonist who spent several years as a musical director on cruise ships, and has studied percussion in India.<\/p> <p><b>Brian Kennedy<\/b> is a writer\/storyteller living in NYC. He's written for The Huffington Post and performed improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade. He tells stories on podcasts and at various venus, including The Moth -- where he's a StorySLAM winner. A long time ago, he wrote plays and produced them in the Minnesota Fringe Festival. Yes, he grew up in Minnesota. Yes, he still has the accent to prove it.<\/p> <p><b>Erin Barker<\/b> is senior producer of The Story Collider and a host of its live show in New York. She is the first woman to win The Moth's GrandSLAM storytelling competition twice and has appeared in its Mainstage and shows in cities across the country, as well as on its Peabody Award-winning show on PRX, The Moth Radio Hour. One of her stories was included in The Moth's New York Times-bestselling book, The Moth: 50 True Stories. She considers herself a Gryffindor.<\/p> <p><b>Ben Lillie<\/b> is a high-energy particle physicist who left the ivory tower for the wilds of New York's theater district. He now writes and performs stories about science and being a scientist, and is a Moth StorySLAM champion. He also writes for TED.com, and likes to say that life is different now, largely because it is.'<\/p> <p>More info and advance tickets:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.unionhallny.com\/event\/944863-story-collider-bad-medicine-brooklyn\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.unionhallny.com\/event\/944863-story-collider-bad-medicine-brooklyn\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.unionhallny.com\/event\/944863-story-collider-bad-medicine-brooklyn\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Please arrive on time to be sure we can sit together and socialize before the show begins.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VSL-NYC\/events\/225052019\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Story Collider: Bad Medicine","id":"225052019","time":1443569400000,"updated":1443613378000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432751474000,"name":"VSL: Unusual Meetups for Those Who Dare to be Different","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18629748,"urlname":"VSL-NYC","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Irreverent Eccentrics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"490 Hudson Street  between Christopher & Grove","name":"PS3","lon":-74.005974,"id":11204482,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443297789000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you think that Modern Western Square Dancing is great fun and challenging too, you're right.\u00a0 Here's\u00a0a chance for you to square dance all night, with no previous experience or partner, and see if beginning classes with Times Squares in October is for you.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>For FAQs, see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/timessquares.org\/_wp\/new-dancers\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/timessquares.org\/_wp\/new-dancers\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/timessquares.org\/_wp\/new-dancers\/<\/a><\/a>.\u00a0 We promise you a great time, and lots of laughs, even if you have two left feet.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Times-Squares-Square-Dance-Club\/events\/225637266\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Dance Party","id":"225637266","time":1443569400000,"updated":1443582239000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357364756000,"name":"Times Squares Square Dance Club","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":6495772,"urlname":"Times-Squares-Square-Dance-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Square Dance Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"181 Mercer Street","name":"NYU Coles","lon":-73.997444,"id":23630182,"state":"NY","lat":40.726051,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":1.70353877544,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":5,"created":1443029717000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>$10 exact change.

Giacomo's core line is comprised of medium to full bodied cigars which feature tobaccos from the famous Oliva Tobacco Company. To blend the core line, Master Blender Jack Guggino spent nearly two and a half years searching for the perfect combination of tobacco leaves. Giacomo cigars feature balanced tasting notes of cedar, pepper, subtle spices.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nGlenfiddich 12 Year<\/p> <p><br\/>Flowing in the Valley of the Deer since 1887, our family\u2019s signature expression is the world\u2019s most awarded single malt Scotch whisky*.<\/p> <p>With a unique freshness from the same Highland spring water we\u2019ve used since 1887, its distinctive fruitiness comes from the high cut point William Grant always insisted upon.<\/p> <p>Carefully matured in the finest American oak and European oak sherry casks for at least 12 years, it is mellowed in oak marrying tuns to create its sweet and subtle oak flavours.<\/p> <p>Creamy with a long, smooth and mellow finish, our 12 Year Old is the perfect example of Glenfiddich\u2019s unique Speyside style and is widely proclaimed the best dram in the valley.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nGlenfiddich 21 Year<br\/>Patiently matured for 21 years on\u2010site at the distillery, it is an exquisite, traditional Speyside whisky, rich and ripe with our Glenfiddich signature notes. But rather than bottle it, as other distillers would, our Malt Master, Brian Kinsman, hand picks selected barrels and adds a sublime finishing touch.<\/p> <p>By finishing our 21 Year Old in Caribbean rum casks it awakens the liquid, rousing it with extra exotic notes of ginger, fig, lime and banana and a vibrant spicy toffee warmth, elevating it from something great to something extraordinary.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nMerchants NY Cigar Bar<br\/>Merchants NY Cigar Bar is well appointed for both large and intimate corporate and private functions.\u00a0 Designed by Prevost Design Inc, the rich carpet and plush furniture with hints of an English Gentlemen\u2019s Club and\u00a0 Victorian influences give a sense of elegance and luxury of a bygone era.\u00a0 The rich marble-top of the bar, with bold designs and colors are emblematic throughout the Lounge.

This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort. A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other.

Recently, economic upturn has improved business for the A\/E\/C industry; for the first time since the recession, there is a growing demand for architectural services. Firms are now bidding for new business, expanding service, diversifying offerings, and growing their talent and teams. During the recession, a declining employment market made it difficult for emerging professionals to find and hold jobs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crainsnewyork.com\/article\/20150615\/REAL_ESTATE\/150619936\/so-many-projects-so-few-architects-how-design-firms-are-filling-a-talent-gap\">Today, this gap in talent, skills, and industry demand has defined a new problem - \u2018a missing a generation of architects.\u2019 <\/a>How are architectural firms shifting their people strategy to bridge the talent gap and appeal to a new generation - their skills, workstyles, and professional expectations?<\/p> <p>This critical moment represents a dual opportunity. With the market favoring employees, now is the time for emerging professionals to leverage their skills and offerings to more strategically shape their career, prove their value and influence, and effect change in the industry\u2019s people policies - from compensation and benefits to learning and professional development. At the same time, firms must deploy a \u2018get ahead, stay ahead\u2019 people strategy to future-proof their talent and their business.<\/p> <p>This panel will explore emergent trends in the current and future hiring market, focusing on the critical opportunity for employers and emerging talent to re-assess and re-value their current strategies.<\/p> <p><b>Panelists:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fxfowle.com\/profile\/8\/people\/9\/tim-milam\/\">Tim\u00a0Milam<\/a><\/b> joined\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fxfowle.com\/\">FXFOWLE<\/a>\u00a0in 2001 and was promoted to Partner in 2004.

Ashkenazi and Italian Jews were forced to live in a relatively big island \u2013 that of the geto, in Venetian vernacular meaning \u201cfoundry\u201d \u2013 surrounded by canals, supervised at night by Christian police, and to undergo a series of socio-economic restrictions aiming to mark a clear distinction between the Jews and the Christian-Catholic majority.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A few decades later also Jews from Spain and the Levant were forced to enter the ghetto. Made up by Jews speaking different languages, observing different religious rules and customs, dressing and behaving differently, listening to different music repertoires, the ghetto soon became a colorful microcosm, a pre-modern socio-cultural melting pot. In spite of the official anti-Jewish legislation, in Venice, Florence, and Rome and in many other Italian and European cities hosting a ghetto, Judeo-Christian human, cultural, intellectual and nonetheless artistic interactions were inevitable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Music probably much more than any other form of artistic discipline expressed the permeability of the ghetto\u2019s walls, the repertoire of one community becoming \u2013 often involuntarily, unconsciously \u2013 patrimony of the other one, traditional monodic Jewish tunes resounding in the polyphonic fabrics of ecclesiastical cappella music, secular Gentile tunes (often those of very obscene popular songs) accompanying some of the most sacred moments during the Hebrew liturgy. This lecture explores Judeo-Christian music interactions during the early modern era, with attention to the rabbinical and ecclesiastical views on this cultural cross-polination, with a look at original contemporary Jewish and Christian sources.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salon-Sanctuary-Concerts\/events\/225360104\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Lecture on 16th century Venice: Cracks in the Wall","id":"225360104","time":1443651300000,"updated":1443664147000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335380192000,"name":"Music Meetups","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":3740742,"urlname":"Salon-Sanctuary-Concerts","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10007","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"21 Park Place","name":"Tent & Trails","lon":-74.008621,"id":16916382,"state":"NY","lat":40.71323,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.72687292099,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439493863000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Great photography is about depth of feeling, not depth of field.<br\/>- Peter Adams<\/p> <p>An exposition of different wildlife photography and a examination of various methods\u00a0<\/p> <p>Roundtable Dialogue about the following:\u00a0<br\/>1.

This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort.

This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort. A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane.

Don't worry if you are coming alone or do not have three people to sign up. People will arrive early so you will have time to mingle with ice breakers and we will help create the teams. Each team will stay together throughout the event.<\/p> <p>Next the fun begins. We will have one male team and one female team stationed at each bowling lane. This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort. A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane. The male team will rotate to the next lane and the process begins again. We will continue for either two hours or until you have met everyone.<\/p> <p>Note: You can still attend and be a member of a team even if you do not want to bowl.<\/p> <p><br\/>Includes: Bowling, Shoes and scorecard matching.<\/p> <p><br\/>**************Food and Drinks are available for purchase********<\/p> <p><br\/>Question: I was interested in someone but am still uncomfortable asking them for contact information.<\/p> <p><br\/>You will have the option to complete a scorecard at the end of the night and take notes during the event.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

This introduction will\u00a0take you soup to nuts - integrating a calendar into your own solution from\u00a0scratch, customizing it, and rolling it out for multiple use cases. Don't come too late - the initial integration happens pretty\u00a0quickly.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nParadise Partners revolutionized FileMaker calendars in 2011 by introducing a user-friendly, drag &amp; drop FileMaker calendar in a web viewer with the release of\u00a0soSIMPLE v1. soSIMPLE v2 opened up the idea even further by introducing interactive calendars to FileMaker WebDirect, smartphone and direct-to-web. The latest\u00a0soSIMPLE v3 added standalone calendars for FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Go, making FileMaker Server optional. The newest version also added an out-of-the-box\u00a0experience with a fully featured calendar solution without any integration required.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on the 30th.

Time travel plays a part in the story but it's really about what her life would have been life in each of the years that she travels to compared to her modern time (set in the 1980s). I still find myself thinking of and missing this character! Also it's $1.99 on Kindle right now in case any of you have one or use the app.<\/p> <p>From the critically acclaimed author of the New York Times bestseller The Confessions of Max Tivoli comes The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells, a rapturously romantic story of a woman who finds herself transported to the \u201cother lives\u201d she might have lived.<\/p> <p>After the death of her beloved twin brother and the abandonment of her long-time lover, Greta Wells undergoes electroshock therapy. Over the course of the treatment, Greta finds herself repeatedly sent to 1918, 1941, and back to the present. Whisked from the gas-lit streets and horse-drawn carriages of the West Village to a martini-fueled lunch at the Oak Room, in these other worlds, Greta finds her brother alive and well\u2014though fearfully masking his true personality. And her former lover is now her devoted husband\u2026but will he be unfaithful to her in this life as well? Greta Wells is fascinated by her alter egos: in 1941, she is a devoted mother; in 1918, she is a bohemian adulteress.<\/p> <p>In this spellbinding novel by Andrew Sean Greer, each reality has its own losses, its own rewards; each extracts a different price. Which life will she choose as she wrestles with the unpredictability of love and the consequences of even her most carefully considered choices?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-751\/events\/224339239\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Sept Meetup:  Discussion of The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells (Greer)","id":"224339239","time":1443657600000,"updated":1443669316000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1175045962000,"name":"Mom's Night Out Book Club","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":461585,"urlname":"bookclub-751","group_lat":41.0600013733,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"406 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"OneTaste New York","lon":-74.002022,"id":23696708,"state":"NY","lat":40.718777,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.25189709663,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443551488000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/0\/0\/600_441335840.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and TurnOn.
