Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Its five-year curriculum covers the entire Buddhist path from sutra to tantra through studying fundamental texts and commentaries, such as Lama Tsongkhapa's Middle-Length Lam-Rim, Maitreya's Ornament\u00a0and Tathagata Essence, and Dharmarakshita's Wheel of Sharp Weapons.<\/p> <p>The academic component of the course is balanced by meditation, retreat, and personal practice, integral elements aimed at enhancing students' ability to bring the Dharma into their lives. Even though each subject stands alone, students who study them all and fulfill all the requirements of the Basic Program (including a final exam and a three-month lam-rim retreat) can get a completion certificate. In accord with Lama Zopa Rinpoche's vision of the Basic Program, they can become qualified teachers certified by the FPMT based on their academic understanding, meditation experience, and exemplary behavior.<\/p> <p>More information can be found\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fpmt.org\/education\/programs\/basic-program\/\">here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BuddhistEventsNewYork\/events\/228469178\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Basic Program Second Module: Presentation of Tenets (Part 2)","id":"228469178","time":1454976000000,"updated":1454988021000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1308855566000,"name":"Buddhist Events New York","group_lon":-74,"id":2068801,"urlname":"BuddhistEventsNewYork","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":12,"distance":2.60537290573,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":11,"created":1450272196000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>What would have happened if Medieval logician William of Occam (he of the famous razor) had met philosopher of language Ludwig Wittgenstein (he of the language games)?

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

first dinner\u2014the Rh\u00f4ne Valley.\u00a0 In that event last summer, I featured the major appellations of both the Northern and Southern Rh\u00f4ne.\u00a0 For this one, we\u2019ll be exploring just two appellations in particular, both in the Northern Rh\u00f4ne\u2014Hermitage and Cornas.\u00a0 This will be a vertical tasting, an unusual opportunity to compare the same wine by the same maker in four consecutive vintages.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll start the evening with two blockbuster whites from Hermitage.\u00a0 Not casual, easy-drinking wines\u2014they might be the most serious white wines you\u2019ve ever encountered.\u00a0 Unlike in the past, we will not taste blind.\u00a0 We\u2019ll taste the reds in order from youngest to most mature and compare the vintages.\u00a0 This will be a dinner aimed at more experienced tasters who are really interested in Rh\u00f4ne wines and comparative tasting.<\/p> <p>The Northern Rh\u00f4ne is a small and seemingly inhospitable wine-growing region that accounts for only 5 percent of total Rh\u00f4ne Valley wine production.\u00a0 The vineyards, among the oldest in France, are arranged in narrow terraces on steep hillsides oriented to catch maximum sunlight and ripen the Syrah grapes.\u00a0 Rarity and labor-intensive viticultural methods combine to make Northern Rh\u00f4ne wines uncommonly expensive, although relative bargains can be found.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/f\/0\/600_446128144.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We will focus our attention on two of the smallest appellations in the region\u2014Hermitage for the whites and Cornas for the reds.<\/p> <p><i>Hermitage:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a small appellation on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne River that is surrounded by the less prestigious (and flatter) Crozes-Hermitage.\u00a0 The robust, ageworthy, Syrah-based reds here have been famous for centuries.\u00a0 But the whites, based on Marsanne and Roussanne grapes, can be equally formidable.\u00a0 The weighty Marsanne grape provides full body and structure while Roussanne contributes more aromatics.\u00a0 The combination is a rich earthy wine with floral and tropical fruit notes and ample earthy minerality.\u00a0 White Hermitage is among the most ageworthy of white wines, and we will be trying two examples with a fair degree of maturity, from 2007 and 2009, made by two of the superstars of Rh\u00f4ne winemaking, Jaboulet and Guigal.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Cornas:<\/i>\u00a0 \u201cCertainly you must be <i>brave<\/i> to drink Cornas, but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d (in the words of wine writer Oz Clarke).\u00a0 South of Hermitage and on the other side of the river, Cornas is another tiny appellation, with a reputation for big, tough, rustic renditions of Syrah that require years of bottle age to tame the rough tannins.\u00a0 This can be true, but modern versions of Cornas can be approachable at an earlier age.<\/p> <p>One of the legends of Cornas was No\u00ebl Verset, who was largely responsible for reviving the reputation of the appellation\u2019s wines in the late 20th century.\u00a0 He retired in the early 2000s (and died this past fall), selling off most of his vineyards upon retirement.\u00a0 A small parcel, however, was retained by his nephew Alain, who carries on the family tradition of Cornas winemaking.\u00a0 Alain owns only a hectare (about 2.5 acres) of Syrah vines, producing less than 100 cases of wine a year.\u00a0 (One could not support a family on this, so Alain\u2019s day job is in a nearby factory that produces garbage cans.)\u00a0 His winemaking is traditional\u2014whole bunches fermented with indigenous yeasts for 15 days, no filtration.\u00a0 The production isn\u2019t large enough to attract the attention of the major wine critics, but the wines are enjoyed by those who appreciate artisanal Syrah winemaking.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I was able to obtain Alain Verset\u2019s Cornas in four consecutive vintages (at a reasonable price), \u201909 through \u201912.\u00a0 Plus I\u2019m including a 2013 Cornas by the well-respected (and more commercial) producer Vincent Paris.\u00a0 We will taste the wines in order from youngest to oldest and compare them in terms of maturity, and consider how vineyard conditions in the various vintages might have affected wine quality.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be returning to L\u2019Apicio in the East Village for this dinner, where the robust menu (and fine glassware) will complement the wines.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lapicio.com\/#\"><a

smell the gumminess of the Marsanne (blended with 35% Roussanne). Intense and noble and interesting and still rather strict, but a really interesting wine that is full bodied. Has no obvious trace of oak and promises an explosion of gorse and gum (that you stick paper with) and greater riches. Less dramatic than Chapoutier's whites but very valid style<i>. \u00a0\u201909 review:<\/i> Rich and nutty and concentrated. Already appealing in a cough-medicine kind of way but it should open up so much more and become much more complex. Long and very serious.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 Another big wine is the rich 2007 Hermitage Chevalier de Sterimberg blanc, which offers a honeyed richness, tropical fruit, marmalade, quince, and white currant characteristics. Medium to full-bodied and long, it should evolve for 10-15 years.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 92<\/i> \u2013 Bright and friendly, with crunchy acidity weaving through the green and yellow apple, melon, and quince flavors. Stays juicy and bright on the finish, with a lingering hint of apple skin.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Guigal Hermitage Blanc\u00a0 $51<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 94<\/i> \u2013 Offers a gorgeous range of heather honey, honeysuckle, and white peach aromas, giving way to a lush yet defined core of macadamia nut, Cavaillon melon, Jonagold apple, and brioche flavors. The long finish drapes wonderfully. Drink now through 2018. \u00a080 cases imported.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 The 2009 Hermitage blanc (approximately 93% Marsanne and 7% Roussanne) reveals the floral\/acacia component of Marsanne intermixed with copious buttery, waxy, honeysuckle notes, a full-bodied, steely mouthfeel, and lots of glycerin and heady richness. It must have around 14.5% alcohol given its high glycerin, yet it possesses attractive elegance from the minerality and old vines from which it is produced. This beauty should be drinkable reasonably early and last for 10-20 years.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Vincent Paris Cornas Granit 60 Vieilles Vignes\u00a0 $39<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92-94+<\/i> \u2013 The 2013 Cornas Granit 60 Vieilles Vignes is serious stuff. Inky colored and loaded with cassis, black raspberry, violets, and licorice, it has beautiful acidity in its full-bodied, ripe, polished style. It has rock-solid mid-palate concentration and terrific length, so give it a handful of years in the cellar and drink bottles through 2025. Like all of Paris\u2019s Cornas releases, it sees only older barrels.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17\/20<\/i> \u2013 Deeper and more complex than the Granit 30, by some distance. Firmly tannic, very dry and peppery to finish. Very much an archetypal Cornas, needing bottle age to soften and flourish.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Alain Verset Cornas\u00a0 $33<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Cellartracker (nonprofessional) review:<\/i> \u201cThe nephew of a legendary Cornas maker. Wasn\u2019t expecting much, but wow I was surprised. The right Cornas characteristics that I love so much, at this young vintage; crushed stones with a bit of olive, mellow black berries, a bit of smoked spice. It is a bit cloudy and has a bit of sediment. Probably unfiltered.

You'll be very disappointed if you're expecting an archetypal Cornas. Instead, as others have noted for different vintages, this is very smooth and fruit driven--similar to what you would expect from a high quality CA Napa or Sonoma label. No rusticity, no barnyard, little earth. Wee bit of pepper. Regardless, I very much enjoyed it, as did those with whom I shared most of the bottle.

In pre-digital days, photographers shot film and sent it to the magazine undeveloped\u2014site unseen. They might not have the opportunity to see what they shot for months and so they relied heavily on their Editors to give them feedback on how they photos looked, how their project was coming together and what \u2018holes\u2019 needed to be filled.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the \u2018photo manager,\u2019 she sorted through the thousands of photographs from dozens of shoots, selecting just the very best to appear in National Geographic travel books.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She worked side-by-side with the top designers at National Geographic to create a consistent look and can share tips on how to create a professional look in a book design.<\/p> <p>Vickie knows how to focus a project and make it doable and support a photographer at any level to be successful and create projects they can be proud of. She also has patience. As a cancer survivor, she knows how to take things a day at a time and enjoy everything that comes her way.<\/p> <p>Vickie also has experience managing and shooting many projects on her own, focusing on everything from heroin addicts and Neo-nazi skinheads to abstract florals, monuments at moonlight to the Oregon Coast and more. She worked with a major book publisher to create a photo book on the history of American women in war and worked as a graphics director at the Albuquerque Tribune.<\/p> <p>In the 1990s, Vickie shot over 150 portrait assignments for People Magazine. Back in the film days, you had know your stuff. You didn't get to spray and shoot when President Clinton was sitting in front of you. And you didn\u2019t get second chances. She has 30 years of experience nailing an image and has transcended into the digital world.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Are you unsure about what kind of project to shoot?<\/b><\/p> <p>Each photographer will work on a personal project of their choosing. This can sound intimidating, but it is easier to learn when you have a concrete goal in mind and we\u2019ll break it down into simple steps and give you a process you can use over and over again.<\/p> <p>In our first session, we\u2019ll talk about what makes a good photo project and get you thinking about what you want to focus on.<\/p> <p>It might mean taking better people pictures or learning lighting. It might mean learning how to shoot nudes or landscapes. That\u2019s great. With that goal in mind, you create a project.<\/p> <p>Here are some examples:<\/p> <p>I love taking macro photos. I\u2019d like to create a photo book with the photos I\u2019ve taken and learn some new techniques.<\/p> <p>2. I want to learn more about shooting landscapes and so I will commit to researching five great places and shoot them at sunrise or sunset.<\/p> <p>3. I want great pictures of my kids! I commit to taking my kids to five interesting places, photographing them, editing them and creating a photo book for their grandparent\u2019s wedding anniversary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you are struggling with ideas, Vickie will help you find a workable project. When you are finished with your project, you will be able to create a book, gallery show or website of your photos, no matter if you shoot landscapes, portraits, sports, fashion or documentary.<\/p> <p>Vickie has worked as a photo editor, working daily with photographers to help them learn to see pictures in a different way, learn how to shoot photos with impact, how plan a shoot and come back with photos that would make them smile and feel good about what they have done.<\/p> <p>Vickie will encourage and inspire you while giving it to you straight in a way that helps you improve quickly. Vickie may momentarily take you out of your comfort zone, but you will feel exhilarated when you reach new heights.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Not only will we be talking about your photos, you will have assignments to look at images of pro photographers and we will break down those photos and discuss why they work or don\u2019t.<\/p> <p>The group won\u2019t be talking about f\/stops and shutter speeds or which camera is best, this photography group is about creativity, thinking, shooting with intention and helping you determine where to go next. We will talk about seeing and shooting light, angles and advanced composition.<\/p> <p><b>Photography Critiques\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Sessions will be conducted online via video conference where we will talk directly and we will do critiques of your work. Personal feedback is critical if you want to grow as a photographer. Everyone in the group will learn from hearing other\u2019s critiques. Vickie\u2019s pretty gentle and she meets you where you are.<\/p> <p><b>Don\u2019t miss out.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

We hope that by being together, listening to each other, and by sharing our experiences, strength and hope, we will learn to see the value of life in a new context. For the first hour of each meeting members share their experiences. The second half of the meeting is reserved for a guest speaker relating to either the legal or emotional aspects of separation\/divorce. We meet every Monday eveing at the Church in the Highlands, 35 Bryant Ave. White Plains, New York. We are a mixed group of men and women. There are about 50 members, with approximately 20 attendees per meeting. There are no fees, new members are welcome, no reservation is necessary. We pass a basket at each meeting and suggest a\u00a0five dollar donation per meeting to cover the cost of the meeting place and coffee\/cookies served at the meeting.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/divorcesupport-362\/events\/228176566\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Separation and Divorce Recovery Group Weekly Meetup","id":"djqpjcyvdblb","time":1454977800000,"updated":1454991050000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1184173694000,"name":"Separation and Divorce Recovery Group","group_lon":-73.75,"id":563152,"urlname":"divorcesupport-362","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Separated or Divorced People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":9.70682144165,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452568776000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Very simple, come, play or sing (or both) and enjoy good company. \u00a0I'll send out the address to everyone who signs up.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Music-Club\/events\/228024210\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Play 1 to 10 minutes of music, beginner to advanced, Renaissance to Rap","id":"228024210","time":1454977800000,"updated":1455041293000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445351527000,"name":"North Jersey Music Club","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":19044800,"urlname":"North-Jersey-Music-Club","group_lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Music Makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"406 Broadway, 2nd Floor","name":"OneTaste New York Center","lon":0,"id":23779946,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454448134000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and TurnOn.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

It has been a much more convenient - and productive - spot and for our regulars, so we will stick with it as long as it continues to fit our needs.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/StatenIsland-Writers\/events\/228592446\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":9900000,"name":"Weekly Write-In!","id":"zvvhklyvdbmb","time":1455055200000,"updated":1455067434000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1360251346000,"name":"Staten Island Writers","group_lon":-74.0899963379,"id":7074772,"urlname":"StatenIsland-Writers","group_lat":40.5999984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07901","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Summit","address_1":"570 Springfield Avenue","lon":-74.366421,"phone":"908-273-3000","name":"The Grand Summit Hotel","id":932260,"state":"NJ","lat":40.714804,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.8982944489,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453905967000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/b\/a\/600_446291706.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Please join RSMG for our post holiday networking party. $18 in advance, $23 at the door.

The Tavern was named after the Minetta Brook, which ran southwest from 23rd Street to the Hudson River.\u00a0Over the course of its long history, the Tavern was frequented by various layabouts and hangers-on including Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Eugene O'Neill, E. E. Cummings, Dylan Thomas, and Joe Gould, as well as by various writers, poets, and pugilists.\u00a0Since its renovation, Minetta Tavern has best been described as \"Parisian steakhouse meets classic New York City tavern.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.minettatavernny.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.minettatavernny.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.minettatavernny.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>RSVPs:<\/b>\u00a0Please do not RSVP No. You only need to RSVP if you want to come to the event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can go.

Welcome to this month's NYC Guitar Lovers Open Mic. \u00a0We are now a separate group from the old NYC Guitar Group. \u00a0So if you haven't done so, please migrate over to here. It's a necessary logistical move.<\/p> <p>With so many new and new-ish players I've pulled \u00a0a few important sections of our FAQ page. We don't have many rules. What we do have is to help all of us have a great evening and to keep things moving \u00a0along. And to accommodate as many players as possible. <b>Please take a minute to read what's below and take it to heart.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Q. What are the rules of this open mic?<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0We play up to two songs or 8 minutes, whichever comes first.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Be respectful of others and they'll return the favor.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Don't apologize on stage (or you will owe me a drink).\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Please no loopers,\u00a0iPad\u00a0backing tracks, fx boxes, extra amps, and stuff like that.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Please put $3 in the kitty to support the the Open Mic. \u00a0We have to pay fees\/dues to the parent MeetUp organization. \u00a0So please bring singles.<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Q. How does signup work?<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p>The sheet gets put out at about 6:00PM. You sign up for a slot and playing starts by 7. We try very hard to get to everyone on the list so a lot of the rules we have are in the interests of that.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>PLEASE NOTE:<\/i>\u00a0Because of the relatively small size of Mary O's, we can accommodate about 20 or so players. Please come come as early as you can to get on the list. Out of necessity the list gets closed when we max out our playing slots.\u00a0\u00a0After the list is closed, we may be able to have a few extra players for one song each.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i>Q. Is there a drink\/food minimum?\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Yes.<\/i>\u00a0Mary O'Halloran requests that in return for hosting us, we return the favor by buying a minimum of two beers or two drinks, or a drink and something to eat. One cup of tea for the entire evening does not help Mary pay her rent.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The bar has plenty of great stuff to drink -- both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The kitchen turns out great food. Burgers, chicken, fish, and there are plenty of vegetarian and salad options as well. PLEASE partake.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mary does need to make a living and we want her to love us so she keeps having us back. If we don\u2019t support Mary, she won't be able to support us.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Guitar-Lovers-Open-Mic\/events\/228123428\/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"duration":14400000,"name":"NYC Guitar Lovers Open Mic","id":"nzxwnlyvdbmb","time":1455058800000,"updated":1455380921000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452900775000,"name":"NYC Guitar Lovers Open Mic","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":19345772,"urlname":"NYC-Guitar-Lovers-Open-Mic","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10002","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"174 Orchard Street","name":"The Skinny Bar & Lounge","lon":-73.988304,"id":1304296,"state":"NY","lat":40.721607,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.96778380871,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452039311000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/b\/3\/600_446010131.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>It's FAT TUESDAY and NYCDMN is combining Open Turntables with massive a MARDI GRAS party!!<\/p> <p>Come dressed in a mask grab a beaded necklace and listen to upbeat southern fried mixes with songs originating from Nawlin's (New Orleans) and the south all played by the select OTT DJs!!<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0 -----------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/>Are you a DJ who wants to spin in an amazing environment among supportive peers??<\/p> <p>This is your chance...<\/p> <p>DJs from all levels of experience, genres &amp; styles are welcome!!<\/p> <p>LOVE for the ART of DJing is REQUIREMENT!! \ud83d\ude04\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTWO STEPS REQUIRED FOR REQUESTS TO SPIN:<\/p> <p><br\/>(1) RSVP for the date you want to spin on Meetup.com (this website)<\/p> <p><br\/>(2) CLICK HERE: <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/lpDlGu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/lpDlGu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/lpDlGu<\/a><br\/><\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And answer all questions on the Google Form.<\/p> <p>All DJs, producers, remixers, artists &amp; fans of the art of DJing (Mixthusiasts) are welcome.

You can combine all your favorite visualization libraries even from different languages on the same page and working with the same data.\u00a0 Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based UI metaphor, but Beaker was designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple languages that communicate with one another through a unique feature called autotranslation. You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell, and everything just works. Beaker comes with built-in support for Python, R, JavaScript, Java, Scala, Clojure, Torch\/Lua, Julia, and more. Each part of your problem can be solved in the language best suited to it. For example, you can scrape the Web in Python, do a regression in R, and then visualize it with D3.js seamlessly in the same notebook. Draves will motivate the design, review the architecture, and give a live demo of Beaker in action.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Scott Draves is an award-winning software artist, VJ, and pioneer of the open source movement. His clients and exhibitions range from the likes of MoMA.org, LACMA, Prix Ars Electronica, Lumen Prize, ZKM, Google, and the Adler Planetarium to Skrillex.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/228594662\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvdbmb","time":1455060600000,"updated":1455073781000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"76 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011","name":"Google NYC","lon":-74.004501,"id":24324396,"state":"NY","lat":40.741779,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.950083673,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453315647000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.32999992371},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Women Who Code is partnering with Google to bring you Google Sandbox NYC!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/b\/b\/600_446089595.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>APPLY HERE:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1dzw6yUWYfl9xplnnevymPiIIiTQqt4EaAB6IpaahRYE\/viewform\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1dzw6yUWYfl9xplnnevymPiIIiTQqt4EaAB6IpaahRYE\/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1dzw6yUWYfl9xplnnevymPiIIiTQqt4EaAB6IpaahRYE\/viewform<\/a><\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>Google\u2019s software engineers develop next-generation technologies that change how millions interact, making the world\u2019s information accessible and useful, and our ambitions reach far beyond just Search.

These will include Korean-style carrot salad (an Uzbek specialty), samsa, lulya kebab, and lamb plov (pilaf). We may consider a few suggestions from the group as well. Please bring CASH. Please, no credit cards. This makes splitting the bill at the end easier for the organizers. (And sometimes their credit card machine doesn't work anyway.)<\/p> <p><br\/>The estimated cost is about $20 a person. Drinks will be ordered and paid for separately.<\/p> <p>To cover our fees to Meetup.com, we will charge each member $1 over the bill at each event.<\/p> <p>No-shows will not be tolerated.

Modern neuroscience offers unprecedented\u00a0access to the brain, but also unprecedented complexity and diversity, both in the\u00a0experiments we can do and the data we can generate. I will describe several open source\u00a0technologies we are working on, for everything from 3d visualization to large-scale\u00a0computing, from reproducible analysis notebooks to mobile games. I'll try to convey both\u00a0what we're learning about the brain with these tools -- and how modern computation, and\u00a0the web, is changing the very way we do science.<\/p> <p><b>Jeremy Freeman<\/b> is a neuroscientist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.janelia.org\/\">Janelia Labs<\/a>\u00a0focusing on the intersection of\u00a0biology and computation. \u00a0Specifically, his research is on understanding how the brain supports complex behavior, and how it might inform the\u00a0design of intelligent systems. Jeremy is passionate about open source and open science,\u00a0helping to build tools for collaboration and reproducibility, and working with scientists,\u00a0developers, and designers across a range of fields. \u00a0Jeremy is one of the key contributors for <a href=\"http:\/\/codeneuro.org\/\">CodeNeuro<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b><i>OpenEXP -\u00a0Teon Brooks &amp;\u00a0Andy Heusser<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our\u00a0projectOpenEXP\u00a0is an open-source platform to facilitate large-scale neuroscience and psychology experiment execution and data collection.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

However, when it comes time to do systems-level programming, one is fast with some hard choices. Give up the higher-level features we all love (by using C), or get stuck in the morass that is C++.<\/p> <p>But, wait!<\/p> <p>Rust offers a third choice. It promises high-level expressivity with the power and control needed for systems programming. This talk provides a general introduction to Rust. It'll introduce the basic syntax, developer tools, and overall \"feel\" of the language. We'll also spend some time focusing on where and when it makes the most sense to use Rust.<\/p> <p><b>About Paulmichael<\/b> As a passionate \u2013 yet pragmatic \u2013 enthusiast of multi-paradigm and polyglot engineering, Paulmichael has spent the past 17 years blending a disparate array of languages, technologies, and methodologies to develop compelling solutions to a wide range of business problems.

Housing, food, transit, medical expenses and other cost-of-living items don't count. (Wondering how we arrived at $150 as the spending threshold? Current JVs get $100\/month. Prorated to account for the 46 days of Lent, this comes to $150.)<\/p> <p>Throughout Lent, feel free to share reflections, support, prayer and ideas for cheap and free activities in NYC on our new NYC FJV Meetup Page. During Holy Week, as the end of the challenge approaches, participants will be invited to come together for a live reflection event and meetup. Details to come!<\/p> <p>** Please note: If the $150 spending threshold is not reasonable for you - maybe you have kids or other circumstances prevent you from meeting that goal - please feel free to set an alternative \"stipend\" that makes sense for you.

In the\u00a0middle of that awesome visualization I felt a burst, a huge leap of energy expanding in my heart chakra (and since I am an energy healer it makes so much sense). Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears. I can feel at ease knowing I have this new tool in my hands, it's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and\u00a0I wanted to first thank you for hosting this. I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I love how you said to write down all your thoughts\/ lists about yourself, as well as goals, to see where the conflicts lie. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\"I met Ayelet at a free Lust to Love Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>Ayelet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron\">www.Facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron<\/a>) is a relationship expert. I asked for her advice regarding my recent breakup with my boyfriend of six years, which is why I went to her event. Ayelet explained that we have a tendency to constantly chase guys who don't treat us right, and we have expectations of other people that in turn, create unhappiness in our lives. Working on the root chakra helps us let go of those expectations and find inner peace.<\/p> <p>The meditation event helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships. The free meditation she led was life changing for me.\"- Annie Yang, NYC<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Once you make your $2 payment you will receive an access code to enter the webinar.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Life-Transformers\/events\/228381331\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"duration":2700000,"name":"Life Done Your Way - a Webinar on Manifesting Abundance","id":"228381331","time":1455130800000,"updated":1455162594000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337054153000,"name":"Transform Your Life: ATTRACT Goals, Relationships, SUCCESS","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3867642,"urlname":"The-Life-Transformers","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"The Life Transformers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.25659668446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453933258000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Greetings Shakespeare Lovers,<br\/>I'm offering a virtual \"meetup\" for you to enjoy at your convenience.

What are people saying?<\/p> <p>-Here is a testimonial: I've been attending Mark Chabus' guided meditation workshop for the past 5-6 weeks. By nature, for the past few years anyway, I've turned into a real worrier and pessimist, due to a few downturns in my life, so I thought I could use this class. Well, there was another bump in the road in my family life (my daughter lost her job) but instead of my typical hand-wringing, poor us, reaction, I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement for her...automatically, without trying. I feel I've been re-wired by Mark's weekly guidance and my subsequent daily practice. Would I say it's a miracle? I think so...... The point is, it works. Come join us and see for yourself. Thank you, Mark. I'm SO glad our paths have crossed. -C.O.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"When you get to the door just hit the buzzer for #4B.

Moderated by John Kriskiewicz, the discussion will focus on recent preservation and adaptive reuse efforts, as well as design and planning underway for both the structure and the surrounding parkland.<\/p> <p>Reception to follow.<\/p> <p>Moderator:\u00a0John Kriskiewicz, Architectural Historian<\/p> <p>Speakers:\u00a0<br\/>Matthew Silva, Filmmaker; Director,\u00a0Modern Ruin: A World's Fair Pavilion<br\/>John Krawchuk, Director of Preservation, NYC Department of Parks and Recreation<\/p> <p>Organized by:\u00a0AIANY Historic Buildings Committee<\/p> <p>Price:\u00a0Free for AIA members; $10 for non-members<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.123signup.com\/register?id=yyjbz\">Register<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/9\/e\/600_437906014.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WorldsFair\/events\/228411425\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":9900000,"name":"Screening & Panel Discussion. - \"Modern Ruin: A World's Fair Pavilion\"","id":"228411425","time":1455144300000,"updated":1455206059000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1295846169000,"name":"NY World's Fair!

Of particular significance amongst functionalities Bloomberg offers is a real-time news search and alerting system which offers it's customers information in a timely manner. While providing a real-time search engine with low latency and even lower index to search latency is a challenge in itself, what makes Bloomberg's offering unique is real-time alerting on any arbitrarily complex boolean query supported by the search engine. So what does it take to build an alerting engine which stores millions of query subscriptions changing every second, and matches them against hundreds of stories coming in every second at peak, to dynamically update user's screens, e-mail them, show popups or otherwise notify them when a news story matches their interest? And what does it take to do this all this in less than 100ms? In this talk, Daniel Collins of the News Search backend team dives into the alerting backend his team maintains, and the story of how they rewrote this entire alerting infrastructure using and enhancing Lucene, and Luwak, a library for managing stored queries.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p><br\/>Daniel is a member of the News Search backend team at the Bloomberg R&amp;D office in London.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

Howard and Alice Goodheart, the couple at the center of Jane Hamilton's 1994 novel, have labored mightily to create a pastoral paradise in a Wisconsin subdivision. Their 400-acre dairy farm is the last in Prairie Center, and they're working flat out to raise their two young girls in a traditionally bucolic manner. Yet paradoxically, they strike their neighbors as unacceptably modern, and have been treated as interlopers since the day of their arrival. Howard, in love with his vocation, chooses not to believe that they've been frozen out. But Alice, flinty and quick to judge, finds things harder. And her job as school nurse doesn't work wonders for her reputation either. Happily, there's one exception to this epidemic of unfriendliness: their closest neighbors. Theresa and Dan, who also have two young daughters, function as a virtual lifeline for the embattled family.<br\/>But in June 1990, whatever idyll the Goodhearts have worked for comes to a permanent end. On a beautiful morning--marred by her 5-year-old's tantrum but still recuperable--Alice looks forward to taking her children and Theresa's youngest for a swim. Distracted for several minutes, she has no idea that the 2-year-old is no longer in the house:<\/p> <p>Lizzy had run to the pond and splashed in. It had felt good on her hot feet and she kept running and then she was pedaling and pedaling. She tried to grab hold of the water, pawing for the metal bar, a ladder rung, her mother, but there was nothing. She clutched and flailed.... She sank. The trout that Howard had stocked in the pond swam along through the dark water. They noticed Lizzy out of the corner of their eyes. They had inherited the knowledge of that look, and they knew it by heart.<br\/>This is only the first of Alice's body blows. Next, she's questioned about one of her students, a memorably bad seed. On the verge of collapse, she cries out, \"I hurt everybody!\"--which will later be construed as a confession. Charged with sexual abuse and unable to come up with $100,000 in bail, she is forced to await trial in jail.<br\/>Narrated first by Alice, then Howard, and then Alice again, A Map of the World moves from intimate domesticity to courtroom drama with grace and subtlety. Hamilton wrote her book when accusations of abuse in schools and day care were peaking, yet this is not a modish work or an \"issue novel\" but a lasting creation of several complex lives.

Lasting for an hour or more without intermission, tent of meeting invites listeners to be enveloped in clouds of sound, creating an environment in which love becomes tangible in a shared moment of musical immersion.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/community-open-house-and-concert-tickets-20972037930\">RSVP for the concert here.<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>(Suggested Donation for concert: $15)<\/p> <p>*Please note the time--the concert begins at 8pm, not 7pm.

It\u2019s very much appreciated and often right on time, when my energies are low, doubts are high, or I need a certain piece of information. Very glad to be part of this community. I do relish sharing a good few tidbits, smiles, meals, and otherwise with you all.<\/p> <p><br\/>I\u2019d like to keep the much beloved RoundUP on a regular schedule forward going. To do that, an assistant has been employed - yeehaw! She compiles and formats the events calendar. Plus emails that to both my NYC meetups and then pushes it out on social media otherwise. This is a good bit of time, and brain power, that I need for writing and other work!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Because this is a community project, and not a moneymaker, I\u2019m requesting your support to pay my assistant so we can keep the RoundUPs in regular rotation. This special EatUP *event* is this an optional online fundraising effort to do that. You can RSVP here and pay $2 and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/nyceatup\/contribute\/\">use Chip In to share any amount you'd like to<\/a>. Every dollar counts! SERIOUSLY. Receiving upwards of $1,200 ensures RoundUP NYC comes out twice monthly. We will produce weekly editions with over $2,400 received. Please know these numbers cover one year.<\/p> <p>Please know I write (and have done the rest of) RoundUP for free.

BNI provides a positive, supportive, and structured environment to exchange quality business referrals. BNI is the largest business networking organization in the world. We offer members the opportunity to share ideas, contacts and most importantly, business referrals.<\/p> <p>Last year Members of BNI passed thousands of referrals, which generated over $4 billion dollars of business for members! BNI is a business and professional referral organization that allows only one person from each profession to join a chapter.<\/p> <p>Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of sales people working for you because all the other members carry several copies of your business cards around with them. When they meet someone who could use your products or services they hand your card out and recommend your services. It's as simple as that!\u00a0It's simple because it's based on the proven concept of \"what goes around, comes around.\" If I help you, you'll help me and we will both benefit as a result. Would you like to increase your business by 20%, 30%, 50% or as much as 100%? You can see results like this! Many have.
