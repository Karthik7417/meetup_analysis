She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

I met the pastors, David and Tracy Whittington. They are wonderful people committed to the Great Commission, helping the needy, and being a joyous, loving influence in their community. Check out their website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/<\/a><\/p> <p>RHLC has a multi-faceted food ministry. On Saturdays they feed the needy at Pioneer Village in Odenton - giving out food and flowers. Also, in their Missions for America ministry, they house, feed and clothe single mothers, orphans, and the homeless. These ministries need help now - and they are growing. Please come help David and Tracy in this wonderful work. At this organizational meeting, we will find the best way for you to help.<\/p> <p>Singles Mixer: After this organizational meeting, feel free to stay at the church for the 7:15pm singles mixer. We usually do something fun, like watch a movie &amp; then have food and fellowship. On October 9 we will be watching the 2nd half of the movie \"Do You Believe\" - followed by a discussion, food &amp; fellowship.<\/p> <p>Parking: At RHLC you can park near the front door of the church at 7489 Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard (along the street or in the free parking garage across the street). There is also a parking lot at the church's rear door, at 133 Delaware Avenue, Glen Burnie.<\/p> <p>Contact me with questions and suggestions: Please email me through this meetup site and\/or call me to let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

These meditation sessions are secular and available to anyone wishing to meditate. All experience levels are welcome. During this session, I'll be offering 4 rounds of 10 to 15 minutes of Shamatha Meditation (also known as Calm Abiding, or Mindfulness meditation). If you are new to meditation and you would like to discuss the technique one on one, please send me a message, and we can schedule time before meditation to go over the technique. After the meditation session we discuss the meditation experience, and also take in select readings from a variety of meditation masters. The focus on most of our reading sessions is about using what we learn in meditation in every day life situations.

With plenty of attractions from the Sword Swallower, the story of William Tell, glass blowing, Jousting, arts and crafts for sale and tons of food, it's a good place to step back in time and have some fun and get some good photos. It's not unusual to see some very well thought out costumes and some not so well thought out ones, but it's a lot of fun. Now, this is a paid location. As of right now, it's $24 per adult (16-61), senior is $20.\u00a0 Gates open at 10, I'm thinking that 10:30AM would be the best option so we can avoid the hassle of parking...which, is on a very, very large field for anyone who has not been there. A word of advice: Bring cash or check. Very few of the vendors take credit card. There are ATM's though the fees are obviously not very good. Also, when photographing anyone who works there, please make sure to ask for their permission. The last time I was there this past labor day, my niece was getting her face painted. I went to get a shot of her and the person running the booth had asked that I not take any photos even though I was just trying to get her face. That was a bit rare but just something to keep in mind. Most folks there are very polite and don't mind their photo being taken.<\/p> <p>We'll meet in front of the ticket area.

We will check people in, fill out forms, and meet our guides at 4pm. We'll get a safety briefing, get harnessed, and then we're off having fun at 5pm. We have access to the course until 8pm!<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Zipline -<\/b> We'll experience the thrill of gliding through the trees 30 feet in the air at speeds of up to 20 mph as we soar on a 330 foot zip line. The park's Adventure Guides will make our experience memorable as we see the forest from a different point of view. First, we'll climb a ladder and cross a cable to get to the zipline platform. Then we'll take off and use gravity to propel us. We'll zipline to one end and halfway back again to end up safely on the ground. It's a great way to begin a fun aerial adventure.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/214400\/giantswing.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Giant Swing -\u00a0<\/b>We'll be strapped into our harness with another member or two, after climbing on a 4 foot high scaffolding, as their patented winch system pulls us back and up to almost 40 feet in the air.

A continuous belay system is employed, which means that we only have to secure our safety line once for each level, letting us focus on our next challenge with confidence. Each of the 19 traverses is designed to entertain and challenge participants. Try the islands in the sky, vine walk, raider bridge, heebie jeebie, or Tyrolean traverse to name a few. Let's conquer them all if we can! We can climb down, be lowered on a static belay, or test ourselves on the leap of faith.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/214400\/climbingwall.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>Climbing Tower -<\/b>\u00a0We can scale all 12 routes up and down the 43 foot high climbing tower.

For more fun, there is a vertical playpen with many exciting and challenging elements like the cargo net, rope ladder, climbing log, firecracker, centipede, and tire \/ dangle duo that will enhance our climbing experience. For a truly unique descent, we can climb headfirst down the Rainbow Serpent or descend via the tube net.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/h8TJvqejba8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/h8TJvqejba8<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Flyer Jump -<\/b> Love a thrill?

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to.

Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

The report includes wild edible greens, shoots, roots, tubers, stalks, berries, fungi, nuts, &amp; seeds, and is intended to be a complement to other study on wild edible plants, whether through classes or independent research. The report does\u00a0<i>not<\/i> include detailed identification guidance, or details on processing, cooking, or preserving wild plants.

If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

While in New York, he is thrown together with cherubic, inquisitive and testy young lass Alice (Yella R\u00f6ttlander), who has been abandoned by her mother, and the pair decide to travel back to Europe with no real idea of where the road will take them. The film is full of love\/hate relationships, an idea that is physically represented by the prickly bond between Philip and Alice , but who also symbolise Wenders\u2019 own bewilderment (and wide-eyed fascination) with the architecture, advertising, music, photography and inescapable cultural-sprawl of the US. There are points when the director allows his voice to ring a little loudly from behind the camera, but the richness and depth of both the photography and the characterisation manage to brush any signs of preachiness and sentimentality from view.(David Jenkins, Time Out London)<\/p> <p>1974 Wim Wenders 1.66:1 B&amp;W DCP 110 min.

For that matter, all legal issues are not criminal in nature. However, homicides, or really just the presence of a corpse, draw the undivided attention of insects. Actually, us, too! Humans are captivated by death, especially when foul play is suspected. Despite the reality that death due to murder, abuse, or negligence represents some of the worst actions that one human can bestow upon another, people are drawn to it. We watch intently on the news, read novels about crime and murder, and have made crime shows the top rated programming on television in the United States. So it should come as little surprise that our number one nemesis\u2014insects\u2014have the same interests that we do. Okay, insect attraction to human or any other animal remains is motivated not out of the macabre (like us), but instead as part of foraging behavior. Yes, several insect species use dead animals as their primary food source. By understanding which insects are attracted to the dead, when they will arrive, and how long they take to complete development under varying environmental conditions, these species become useful pieces of physical evidence in investigations of suspicious or unexplained deaths. Using aspects of insect biology in this deductive manner is the basis for forensic entomology, the branch of forensic science and sub-field of entomology that deals with issues in which insect and arthropod biology intersects with the judicial system. Of course the reality is that forensic entomology is much broader than just death investigations, and also includes legal aspects of insects associated with food (stored product entomology), dwellings (urban entomology), and matters of national security. By understanding the biology of necrophagous and synanthropic (ecologically associated with humans) insects, we can begin to predict why and when certain insects will become associated with human habitation, stored food, or colonizing a corpse.<\/p> <p><b>MES meeting at 8:00 pm;\u00a0Lecture begins 8:15 pm.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Location: <\/b>UMBC Bioscience Building - \u00a0Room 004 \u00a0\u00a0Find a campus map at: <a href=\"http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/.\"><a href=\"http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/about.umbc.edu\/visitors-guide\/campus-map\/<\/a>.<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Meet for Dinner before the Lectures<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in meeting for dinner before the lectures, you are invited to join the guest speaker and your fellow MES members at Kibby\u2019s Restaurant and Lounge, \u201cHome of Baltimore\u2019s Best Shrimp Salad Sandwich.\u201d Kibby\u2019s is located inside the Baltimore Beltway at 3450 Wilkens Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21229, just 15 minutes from UMBC.

Rivers, Ph.D. ,Professor, Department of Biology, and Director of the Forensic Studies Program, Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland<\/p> <p><b>Background:<\/b> My foray into entomology began as an undergraduate at Ball State University (BS in Biology) when I was given the opportunity as a freshman to work with Dr. Harold Zimmack, an entomologist specializing in invertebrate pathology. His enthusiasm for insects was infectious and quickly won me over. From there I received my Ph.D. in Entomology with an emphasis in insect physiology while working in the laboratory of David Denlinger at The Ohio State University. My thesis work was focused on behavioral, physiological, and biochemical interactions between the parasitic wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis <\/i>(Walker) (Pteromalidae) and its filth fly hosts. I jumped at the chance to do a project that no one else in the lab was doing. Importantly, all of the other graduate students and post docs in the Denlinger lab were working with sarcophagids of some sort, so my project represented an impending threat to their research.\u00a0 Thus I began my decades-long journey of working on research projects that annoyed or offended my colleagues! I completed a postdoc in the laboratory of Michael Strand at the U. of Wisconsin working with a polyembryonic wasp <i>Copidosoma floridanum <\/i>(Ashmead) (Encyrtidae), and in 1994, started as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Loyola College, now Loyola University Maryland. Since 2011, I have served as the Director of the Forensic Studies program, and just completed my second stint as department chair. My research interests are focused on fly\/wasp interactions in carrion communities, the physiology of heat production within maggot masses, and I am now in the midst of initiating a research program aimed at biological control of biting tabanids (horse\/deer flies).<\/p> <p><b>Photo:\u00a0<\/b>A mass of mostly <i>Lucilia illustris <\/i>(Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) formed in the mouth opening on the head of a dead Virginia Opossum, <i>Didelphis virginiana <\/i>Kerr (Mammalia: Didelphidae).<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet in the University of Maryland at Baltimore County Bioscience Building, Room 004--one floor below street level.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/marylandnature\/events\/225948326\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Silent Witnesses: Insects as Tools in Legal Investigations","id":"225948326","time":1445040000000,"updated":1445052498000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1290469464000,"name":"The Natural History Society of Maryland","group_lon":-76.5299987793,"id":1741675,"urlname":"marylandnature","group_lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Naturalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21401","country":"us","city":"Annapolis","address_1":"2072 Sommerville Rd","name":"Union Jacks","lon":-76.536835,"id":12050582,"state":"MD","lat":38.981178,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.842716217,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443572152000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It is a little-known fact that most Amish practice a tradition, similar to the Christian \"Confirmation\" and Jewish \"Bar Mitzvah,\" called \"Rumspringa\" (literal translation: \"running around\") in which Amish children at the age of 16 have an opportunity to live free of the strict Amish code of conduct before deciding if they want to come back and be baptized into the Amish church.

The event is outside so take that into consideration when you decide what to wear (wearing your AAHA shirt or your yellow Adopt Me shirt is preferable) although it is covered (unlike Hunt Valley). We need 2 handlers per dog and one person to man the table (handing out info, selling t-shirts). The more people the better as it gives us more visibility and draws attention to what we're doing. If you're available to help out please let me know. We need people to pick up dogs at Tail End Kennel and transport them to the event (pick up is at 1130) and people to return the dogs to the kennel after the event. Usually one dog per vehicle unless we have a bonded pair that are used to being together. You can volunteer to just transport, handle, man the table or a combination. You do not have to stay the whole time.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/0\/8\/2\/600_442836994.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>When responding please let me know what you'd like to do and what your hours of availability are.

the prefix \"PRE-\" in the title! This will be prior to Halloween as I'm sure that someone will post an event for a Halloween party that weekend. For this event, I'd like to get together to watch a couple of recent American animation films that may not be as well known as their Pixar and Disney counterparts but are both still great movies. Both films will help us get into the Halloween mood and even into the pre-holiday spirit (Christmas is starting earlier every year!). The first movie is \"The Book of Life\" (2014) and the second is \"Rise of the Guardians\" (2012). Oddly enough I just realized that both films were helped produced by Guillermo del Toro.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/oi59.tinypic.com\/6pudy1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Short summary for \"The Book of Life\" (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2262227\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2262227\/<\/a>)<br\/>- In the Mexican town of San Angel, Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zo\u00eb Saldana) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been friends ever since childhood. Although their lives have taken different paths -- Maria was sent to Europe, Joaquin joined the military, and Manolo studied to become a bullfighter -- one thing remains the same: Manolo and Joaquin both want to marry Maria. Little does the trio know that battling husband-and-wife deities have made a high-stakes wager on the love triangle's outcome.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/oi58.tinypic.com\/2gx429i.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Short summary for \"Rise of the Guardians\" (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1446192\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1446192\/<\/a>)<br\/>- Generation after generation, immortal Guardians like Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) protect the world's children from darkness and despair. However, an evil boogeyman named Pitch Black (Jude Law) schemes to overthrow the Guardians by obliterating children's belief in them. It falls to a winter sprite named Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to thwart Pitch's plans and save the Guardians from destruction.<\/p> <p>So come join us for a fun, light-hearted get together. After watching these films, if you happen to attend an anime convention and see someone cosplaying a green bird-like fairy calling herself the Tooth Fairy or a cosplayer in a red dress wearing a giant sombrero on her head with hundreds of candles, you'll know what characters they are!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/baltimoregenshiken\/events\/224615471\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"PRE-halloween American Animation Movies","id":"224615471","time":1445101200000,"updated":1445113277000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1199932525000,"name":"Baltimore Genshiken - Anime, Manga, Gaming, and Cosplay Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":937363,"urlname":"baltimoregenshiken","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Otaku"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":21.746717453,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443830661000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Now that the fall season is upon us lets go for a tractor rid, pick some pumpkins, run through a corn maze and so much more.

Qigong encourages a positive outlook on life and helps eliminate harmful attitudes and behaviors.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

Using dogbane or stinging nettle and yucca, participants will learn several hands-on methods of achieving a strong, lasting, and neatly twined cordage. The instructors will also demonstrate other methods of making cordage in the field, such as with cambium, tree roots, and grasses, discuss the use of sinew and rawhide, and share their insights and experience about both the ideal materials to use for various purposes, as well as the necessity of being flexible and at ease with the materials that are around you.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck.

A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life. This meditation will occur every Monday evening unless notified otherwise.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long).

So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride.

While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended. Good quality, bright lights are a must with a long battery life, preferably up to 3 hours. Two lights are recommended, one for the handlebars, and one for the helmet. \u00a0(Here is a link to a cheap one on amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006QQX3C4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\">Cheep 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>)\u00a0Basic tools, a spare tube \/ patch kit, and a mobile phone are all recommended to bring.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>8\/18\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/25\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>9\/1 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09\/8\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/22\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>10\/6 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/13\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/20\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/27\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>11\/3\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011\/10\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/17\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/24\u00a0\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>12\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Tsunami is a popular Asian fusion restaurant on Main Street with good appetizers, sushi, and a nice roomy ambience. Happy hour specials are from 4:30-6:00 pm.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4.
