We have a particular interest in fostering positive mental wellness among--and assimilating insights and wisdom from--individuals with lived experience of mental health issues and extreme states. (We use the term \"extreme states\u201d here to recognize and include those who do not necessarily believe that extreme modes of awareness should automatically be viewed as health problems.)<\/p>\n<p>Most of the gatherings being hosted under the Propeller banner right now are what we call \"creative safe-spaces\" and are for individuals with past or present experience of mental health issues\/extreme states. Propeller's creative safe-spaces reject the problem\/problem-solving framework that tends to guide most traditional support groups, aiming instead to cultivate positive mental wellness by fostering positive forces such as community, connection, creativity, and fun. This is done in part through the offering of (what we at least hope are) interesting and engaging creative\/creative collaborative activities such as \"Exquisite Corpse\" (a surrealist drawing game), collaborative audio collage, Dada poetry, and the raising of funds for just causes through the creation of sellable art. It is worth noting that while there is a focus on creativity and creative collaboration at our creative safe-spaces, there is 0% need for anyone who comes to be artistically skilled, and everything is 100% laid back in terms of whether you want to participate in activities, make things on your own, or just hang out!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of each Propeller creative safe-space there are opportunities to make requests and offers to other Propeller frequenters (r<span>equesting help with cleaning your apartment or offering to lend someone a book, for example) as well as opportunities to set up mutually supportive arrangements (agreeing to be somebody's \"gym buddy\", cooking partner, etc...). There will also be opportunities to announce events or projects that you see as being relevant to Propeller's mission and spirit. If you are planning on attending a Propeller creative safe-space, you may want to do some thinking ahead of time about what you might want to offer, request, or announce, or about what kinds of mutually supportive arrangements you might want to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Please know that you do not need to be particularly in need of support to come to a Propeller creative safe-space. All that you need is to have had experience of mental health issues\/extreme states at some time in your life. For some people, some or all of our gatherings may have more to do with celebration than support. That is totally fine. In fact, that is positively fabulous!<\/p>\n<p><span><i><b>Join the group to stay in the loop as we work to fulfill our vision and offer more events at more locations around the city!

Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit. You will be free to control your future because of your fitness level rather than being confined and restricted by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/highres_438394699.jpeg","photo_id":438394699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/600_438394699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/8\/b\/thumb_438394699.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186822598,"name":"Jim Goldfuss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/highres_245822972.jpeg","photo_id":245822972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/member_245822972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/9\/c\/thumb_245822972.jpeg"}},"members":40,"name":"Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT)","id":18572613,"state":"NY","urlname":"Long-Island-Fitness-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430583604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"exploring","name":"Exploring","id":17522},{"urlkey":"city-exploration","name":"city exploration","id":18942},{"urlkey":"explore-local-area","name":"Explore Local Area","id":30535},{"urlkey":"city-walks","name":"City Walks","id":113737},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-york-city","name":"Exploring New York City","id":131810}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/City-Explorers\/","rating":0,"description":"Group for those interested in walking around in the city in new places, discovering new things.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":115796622,"name":"Katie ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/highres_166296742.jpeg","photo_id":166296742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/member_166296742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/8\/6\/thumb_166296742.jpeg"}},"members":457,"name":"City Explorers","id":18573217,"state":"NY","urlname":"City-Explorers","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430585976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"small-business-online-marketing","name":"Small Business Online Marketing","id":84796},{"urlkey":"business-plans","name":"Business Plans","id":114893},{"urlkey":"winning-business-plans-and-strategies","name":"Winning Business Plans and Strategies","id":370031},{"urlkey":"business-plan-financials","name":"Business Plan Financials","id":923262}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SCORE-NYC-Business-Mentoring-and-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"SCORE NYC offers affordable workshops in a wide range of small business topics.

I live in Westport, CT with my two boys aged 10 and 12. While doing my Masters at Teachers College, Columbia University I found the world of Online Marketing by chance. I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F. Being able to work from anywhere in the world is one of the greatest benefits the Internet can provide for you.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>_______________<\/p> \n<p>Please join our group and meet us for social gatherings to share online marketing ideas, business opportunities, traffic generation techniques, or simply just to mastermind and socialize.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><i>\"To associate with other like-minded people in small purposeful groups is for the great majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction\"<\/i> ~ Aldos Huxley<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/highres_439170983.jpeg","photo_id":439170983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/600_439170983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/thumb_439170983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183873918,"name":"Meidee Lim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/highres_243221504.jpeg","photo_id":243221504,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/member_243221504.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/thumb_243221504.jpeg"}},"members":216,"name":"New York Online Business & Entrepreneurs Meetup","id":18583893,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Online-Business-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Online Marketers & Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431115527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Webinars\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To thrive in today's economy, you need knowledge.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned. They should be banned&nbsp; now.\u201d Rosemary Dreger Carey, an organizer for 350NJ, says, \u201cTransporting highly volatile oil by any means--train, pipeline or barge--is inherently unsafe. And it is unnecessary because we have the technology and natural resources right here in New Jersey to switch to clean, safe renewable energy.\u201d The Danger Zone March is one of six grassroots events happening across New Jersey and New York to oppose risky and unnecessary area fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Pilgrim Pipeline and Port Ambrose LNG (liquid natural gas) facility.&nbsp;

Also, human beings come in different shapes, sizes and colors; we accept this fact and wish to foster an environment where those in attendance are not judged by how their body looks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My wife and I created this group because we could not find nudist activities that were inside of the city and accessible by public transportation. Also, we had difficulty finding people who are interested in hanging out while being nude. Therefore, it is our hope that we can make new friends that enjoy the freedom that comes with spending time in the buff! :)<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>Note to women: Most of the people who have been expressing interest in the group seem to be men, but the larger nudist community seems to have about equal numbers of both sexes. Most of our sponsored activities will be approximately gender balanced, so you needn't fear being one of the few women surrounded by a sea of men.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><span>Note to everyone: We ask the signup questions for a reason. One word answers are not acceptable, since they tell us nothing about you.<br><\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/3\/a\/highres_437285178.jpeg","photo_id":437285178,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/3\/a\/600_437285178.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/3\/a\/thumb_437285178.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":1032449,"name":"TheGeek","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/4\/highres_4093620.jpeg","photo_id":4093620,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/4\/member_4093620.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/5\/3\/4\/thumb_4093620.jpeg"}},"members":402,"name":"New York City Indoor Nudist Friends","id":18586726,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Indoor-Nudist-Friends","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Urban Nudists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431276567000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"landlords","name":"Landlords","id":484},{"urlkey":"realestateagent","name":"Real Estate Agent","id":2027},{"urlkey":"homebuyer","name":"Home Buyers","id":6785},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Real-Estate-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group open to anyone and everyone (agents, buyers, sellers) interested in the Manhattan Real Estate Market.

Unless we were accept the fundamental notion that human beings we disagree are inherently evil, we must work to find the good in all- even if it takes a lot of work to challenge Staten Islanders in order to dig it out of them. If you believe in working toward achieving social justice on Staten Island- and trying our best to get ALL Staten Islanders on board with us (though we may likely fail in many cases)....then this is a group for you. <br><\/p>","lon":-74.0899963379,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/0\/5\/highres_441777093.jpeg","photo_id":441777093,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/0\/5\/600_441777093.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/0\/5\/thumb_441777093.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":186750684,"name":"Erik Pennacchio","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/a\/3\/8\/highres_246059960.jpeg","photo_id":246059960,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/a\/3\/8\/member_246059960.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/a\/3\/8\/thumb_246059960.jpeg"}},"members":66,"name":"Social Justice Action Staten Island","id":18588733,"state":"NY","urlname":"Social-Justice","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.6300010681,"who":"Social Justice Action Figures"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431349866000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"summer-fun","name":"Summer Fun","id":17139},{"urlkey":"fun-activities-for-the-summer","name":"Fun Activities for the Summer","id":40633}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/summercampwithFrIeNdzZzz\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Yo- 5 of us are friends that know each other.

There are many forms of violence that we deal with, directly or indirectly, every day. Physical violence\/threats, racial violence and discrimination, sexual\/gender violence, and economic violence are probably the ones most clearly recognized, but there are more subtle forms as well (psychological, moral violence.) The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value. Recognizing the link between personal change and social change, The Community offers readings, exercise, and seminars that help us to align the way we think, feel and act, overcome the lack of meaning, and build a less violent and more human world.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10325289,"name":"Dennis Redmond","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/highres_246139178.jpeg","photo_id":246139178,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/member_246139178.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/e\/a\/thumb_246139178.jpeg"}},"members":23,"name":"The Community of Nonviolence Sunnyside","id":18590121,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Community-of-Nonviolence-Sunnyside","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431367471000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744},{"urlkey":"spontaneous-fun","name":"Spontaneous Fun","id":30449},{"urlkey":"new-experiences","name":"New Experiences","id":34477},{"urlkey":"nyc","name":"NYC","id":39508},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people","name":"Trying New Things with Like Minded People!","id":140995},{"urlkey":"try-new-experiences","name":"Try New Experiences","id":278391}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hooplas\/","rating":0,"description":"Let's get together for affordable and fun events &amp; activities in New York City.

So working with the Moon provides us with an opportunity to take the time to create SACRED SPACE for ourselves. It\u2019s necessary. There is something so powerful when women come together to support each other on their journey, in the hopes and dreams. We are healed, we are nurtured, we feel comforted and understood. Moreover, when you share sacred space with other women, you magnify the power of your intentions and you energetically create a web of support for not only your circle of women friends but with women everywhere. There is no judgment or criticism present. We are able to listen wholeheartedly to what each woman has to say, holding her in support and compassion. A circle also allows that everyone within it, is equal. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honored, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.

A few days later he found himself in the military camp, T2, outside of Goma, where he met five boys being held prisoner by the national army. The boys had been child soldiers, taken from their homes and forced to fight for rebel groups, until one night they escaped and ran to the national army for refuge. Now they were being treated as enemies of the state.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>He spent the day with the boys, trading stories laughter and tears. One boy told him of children too small to carry guns being sent to the front-lines, armed with only a whistle. Sean wrote to a few friends of this single story of a single day, who then forwarded it around the world. Thousands of strangers wrote back asking: what can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fallingwhistles.com\">Falling Whistles<\/a> is a non-profit organization campaigning for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our goal is to create a sustainable peace and to help local entrepreneurs rebuild their war-torn community. We work with Congolese visionaries, leaders creating progress in business, education, health and culture to create sustainable jobs and a sustainable economy. We raise our voices to advocate for peace and to help end one of the deadliest wars of our time. The movement and coalition though builds upon the involvement and commitment of whistleblowers from all over the world, and this is where you come in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the start of the first NYC Whistler Society. We join a global network of local chapters dedicated to whistleblowing and together, we will start the conversation here in New York. We will develop innovative ways to get the attention of our community. We will support Congolese entrepreneurs through creating fundraising opportunities for their businesses and projects. We will wear our whistle as a symbol of peace. We will create a change.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Calling all whistle blowers!

Gnosis is found within the mysteries of the Egyptian and Mayan ruins, within the art of the Greeks and Romans, within the stories of Buddha, Jesus, and Moses. Gnosis is as ancient as life itself and is not bound by any one culture, religion, or people. Classically, the teachings of Gnosis were hidden from the public and guarded by an elite priesthood in every civilization, however, due to the age in which we live, these teaching have been made public for all to know. Join us to discover, learn, and practice this profound science in order to reach your own Self- Realization and Liberation. Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering. We kindly welcome you to join us in the path of Self-Realization taught by so many Buddhas and Avatars before us. We teach in the tradition of Samael Aun Weor.

All I want to do is save some money while traveling with other Christians. I would go on one of those ministry trips, but they're really expensive since most of them are fundraisers. Not to mention the fact that we have to pay for their preachers and their entertainers. How about we keep things simple. Let's just pick a date to travel with our families to certain destinations. They have things for singles, alternative lifestyles, and every other group you can think of.&nbsp; So why not have something for Christian families? We can fellowship with one another while we're there, and have more fun than any entertainer can provide. We can do short trips, long trips, far trips, or close trips. We can even do something as simple and inexpensive as going to a state park together.&nbsp; Cruises are always fun too.

Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

To facilitate dinner-table discussions and to ensure that everyone is able to taste and retaste all the wines, attendance will be capped at 10 men per dinner. To cover the cost of the wines, attendees will pay a fee when RSVPing.

Also just more fun to work in a team rather than go about it solo. :P<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to suggest events or step up for co-organizing. &nbsp;I'll be traveling a lot so I won't be able to host too frequently.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/f\/highres_437760943.jpeg","photo_id":437760943,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/f\/600_437760943.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/f\/thumb_437760943.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":97531102,"name":"William","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/7\/e\/highres_124449342.jpeg","photo_id":124449342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/7\/e\/member_124449342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/7\/e\/thumb_124449342.jpeg"}},"members":89,"name":"Algorithmic Trading NYC","id":18619890,"state":"NY","urlname":"Algorithmic-Trading-NYC","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Algo Traders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432415638000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"african-cuban-rhythms-dance","name":"African Cuban Rhythms & Dance","id":120760},{"urlkey":"latin-dance-lessons","name":"Latin Dance Lessons","id":165766}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Afro-Latin-Dance-Collective\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is dedicated on building a fun, exciting, innovative and fulfilling latin dance community, centered around Afro-Latin dances such as Salsa\/Mambo (NYon2), Cha Cha Cha, Boogaloo, Afro-Cuban dance.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/7\/2\/highres_439257714.jpeg","photo_id":439257714,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/7\/2\/600_439257714.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/7\/2\/thumb_439257714.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7629606,"name":"Manny","photo":{"photo_id":110630812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/6\/7\/c\/member_110630812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/6\/7\/c\/thumb_110630812.jpeg"}},"members":369,"name":"Afro-Latin Dance Collective","id":18620025,"state":"NY","urlname":"Afro-Latin-Dance-Collective","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Afro-Latin Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Pompton Lakes","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432420848000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classics","name":"Classic Books","id":506},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"small-groups-book-club-golf-coffee-etc","name":"Small groups - book club, golf, coffee, etc.","id":15201},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"book-club-tea-brunch","name":"BOOK CLUB - TEA - BRUNCH","id":18862},{"urlkey":"small-groups-book-club-discuss-issues","name":"Small Groups - Book Club, Discuss Issues","id":21356},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966},{"urlkey":"reading-discussion","name":"Reading & Discussion","id":41530}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Readers-of-North-Jersey\/","rating":3.67,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone who enjoys reading and wants to make new friends in the process!

BPD is a stressful condition that causes great pain in the sufferer as well as the people who are closest to him\/her. Until recently, there's been a tendency for professionals to blame parents for their children's disorder, which further burdens family members. Parents need to find ways to maintain their equilibrium in order to help their struggling children. Partners and spouses of people with borderline personality often question whether they should stay in their relationships. Children whose parents have this disorder have complicated issues that carry over into adulthood. We're hoping to share our experiences with other people who've 'been there' and to find ways to live more fully and more peacefully.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":101032892,"name":"Leslie K Deutsch","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/highres_246559399.jpeg","photo_id":246559399,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/member_246559399.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/thumb_246559399.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"Family and Friends \/ Borderline Personality Disorder","id":18632271,"state":"NY","urlname":"Family-and-Friends-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Meetup","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Port Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432841064000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"kayaking","name":"Kayaking","id":590},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"stand-up-paddle-boarding","name":"Stand Up Paddle Boarding","id":18488},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"beginners-surfing","name":"Beginners Surfing","id":27752},{"urlkey":"surfers","name":"Surfers","id":86048},{"urlkey":"stand-up-paddle-sup-newbies","name":"Stand Up Paddle: SUP Newbies","id":100250}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Port-Washington-Stand-Up-Paddle-Boarding-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Kostal Paddle provides Stand Up Paddle Board Lessons, Yoga Classes, Rentals and\nTours along with Kayak Rentals to Port Washington located on the North Shore of Long Island.

He thoroughly enjoys playing at the various dog parks and dog runs&nbsp;in Manhattan Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Prospect Park and&nbsp;other dog-friendly venues in Brooklyn. &nbsp;We are&nbsp;constantly looking for new&nbsp;places to explore!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rusty doesn't care if his Beagle&nbsp;cousins are purebred or mixed breed... or if they live&nbsp;in Brooklyn or Lynbrook!&nbsp; He doesn't even care if his playmates look like him or not!&nbsp; He just&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;make friends, run free, play&nbsp;and have fun with&nbsp;like-minded canines... no matter how young, or how&nbsp;old, or what breed they may be!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: &nbsp;Membership in&nbsp;our&nbsp;Brooklyn Beagles Club is totally FREE, however, the Club's membership roster&nbsp;will be&nbsp;limited to no more than <b>50<\/b> \"ACTIVE\" Members for the following three reasons:<\/p>\n<p>1)&nbsp; MeetUp.com's monthly maintenance fees&nbsp;increase substantially for Groups with more than 50 Members.<\/p>\n<p>2)&nbsp; Since I personally absorb all the costs associated with keeping this Club's&nbsp;web site in operation (never asking any Member for any contributions to help defray those costs) it&nbsp;makes no economic sense to me to pay&nbsp;increased monthly fees&nbsp;for a Group of more than 50 Members, when we have <i>existing<\/i> Members who have NEVER attended a scheduled MeetUp event; who have NEVER posted a single&nbsp;comment on our web site; who have NEVER participated in any of our Discussion Forums; or who have NEVER uploaded any photographs onto&nbsp;their personalized Photo Albums (which&nbsp;they requested be created for them at the time they joined our Club!).<\/p>\n<p>3)&nbsp; Despite all of that, the reality is that having 50 or more canine Members attending a scheduled MeetUp event at one time becomes unmanageable in any of our typical venues and would be overwhelming for any non-Brooklyn Beagles Club dog owners and their dogs who may already be present at a particular public venue when we arrive as a Group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is no&nbsp;point in having more than 50 Members in&nbsp;a Group if&nbsp;many of those Members choose&nbsp;to remain \"inactive\".<\/p>\n<p>The&nbsp;only reason this Club exists is to offer our canine kids&nbsp;periodic breaks from the monotony of living in an urban environment with very few outlets for them to be what nature intended them to be!&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, Member participation is crucial... or there is no reason to have a Club like this in the first place!<\/p>\n<p>I think you will agree that our&nbsp;pooches would benefit more from having a small group of ACTIVE Members, than a large group of NON-ACTIVE Members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So what constitutes&nbsp;an \"ACTIVE\" Member?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Member is considered to be \"ACTIVE\" if, within the past&nbsp;6 months, he\/she:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has attended at least ONE scheduled MeetUp Event; or...<\/p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has uploaded one or more photos into&nbsp;his\/her Photo Album (if a personalized Photo Album was created&nbsp;at his\/her request); or...<\/p>\n<p>3)&nbsp; Has posted a comment in any of our Discussion Forums; or...<\/p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has responded with an \"RSVP\" to a scheduled MeetUp event (even if he\/she indicates that he\/she cannot attend the scheduled MeetUp event); or...<\/p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;his\/her intent to&nbsp;become an active Member of the Club in the near future, either via an Email, a Club Post or a Club Message.<\/p>\n<p>Once our membership has reached 50 Members, new requests to join&nbsp;the Brooklyn Beagles&nbsp;Club will be held \"in queue\" until an existing Member either elects to leave the Club, or is removed from the Club's membership roster due to continual non-participation, inactivity or obvious loss of interest&nbsp;during the previous 6 months, as&nbsp;stipulated above.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: &nbsp;The Brooklyn Beagles Club reserves the right to remove any NON-ACTIVE Member (as defined above) at any time and without any prior, or subsequent notice, in order to&nbsp;make room&nbsp;for a new&nbsp;Member requesting to join the Club... thus preserving the maximum number of 50 Members.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Member contributions&nbsp;will NOT be accepted in this \"not-for-profit\" Club, so&nbsp;you will NOT find&nbsp;the \"Chip in\" icon on&nbsp;our MeetUp.com website.&nbsp; We have nothing to sell.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;NEVER ask you for money.&nbsp; We have no secret agendas!!<\/p>\n<p>If you request that a FREE Photo Album be created exclusively for you when you join, PLEASE upload at least&nbsp;one or two photos so that your fellow Members can admire&nbsp;your canine kid(s)&nbsp;too!&nbsp; It's very simple to do and it only takes a minute or two of your time.<\/p>\n<p>Your&nbsp;personalized&nbsp;Photo Album&nbsp;is located on our Club's \"Photos\" section.&nbsp; Simply respond to&nbsp;the first three&nbsp;very short Member Profile questions when you request to join&nbsp;our Club so that we may have the details we need to create your customized Photo Album. &nbsp;You can then upload as many photos onto it as you like!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you'd rather not have a personalized Photo Album created for you, that's OK too! &nbsp;Just indicate your preference&nbsp;at the time that you request to join.<\/p>\n<p>If distance makes it difficult (or impossible) for you to&nbsp;attend any&nbsp;of our MeetUps, we can all still benefit&nbsp;from your participation in our Discussion Forums&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;our collective&nbsp;canine wisdom for the benefit of our canine kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what this Club is all about!<\/p>\n<p>Our Club is unique in that our Members agree NOT to sue other Club Members for any potential liability claims resulting from their participation in a scheduled MeetUp event.&nbsp; This added peace of mind is a benefit afforded to ALL of us by your acceptance of our Waiver of Liability Agreement (WLA) if you&nbsp;plan to attend any of our scheduled MeetUp events.&nbsp; The 4th (and last) question posed to you when you join our Club relates to this item.<\/p>\n<p>Our&nbsp;WLA protects ALL&nbsp;of our Members in ways that membership in other MeetUp Groups\/Clubs do not!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can review this document by clicking on the \"Pages\" section of our website, scrolling down to the Table of Contents and clicking on \"Waiver of Liability Agreement\"... or, just click on the link below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrooklynBeaglesClub\/pages\/WAIVER_OF_LIABILITY_AGREEMENT\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrooklynBeaglesClub\/pages\/WAIVER_OF_LIABILITY_AGREEMENT\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We&nbsp;have our own YouTube Channel (\"Brooklyn Beagles Club\") where we post videos of all the dog-friendly venues we typically visit, as well as those which we plan on visiting in the future. &nbsp;You can also subscribe (for free)&nbsp;to our YouTube.com Channel to stay up to date on all of our Club videos in one convenient location!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCQ7gBkmSBkKNyiAaWOqQS1Q\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCQ7gBkmSBkKNyiAaWOqQS1Q<\/a><\/p>\n<p>All of our MeetUp events&nbsp;are held at public venues with&nbsp;NO admission fees and are usually scheduled either bi-weekly or monthly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, join NOW...&nbsp;and get FULL access to our Club's next MeetUp event details, location maps, our Discussion Forums, past MeetUp postings and videos, Club MeetUp photos, Member Photo Albums and much more!<\/p>\n<p>Let's get&nbsp;all of our&nbsp;pooches together in one place so that they&nbsp;may run free into the wind&nbsp;and&nbsp;play to their heart's content!&nbsp;

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying. Please do not wear heavy materials (denim) or cotton as they are liable to get waterlogged and uncomfortable very quickly. A hat. Sunglasses. Sunscreen. Water resistant shoes (flip flops are fine)<\/p> \n<p><b>Please bring<\/b>: A bottle of water (you will need to hydrate). A change of clothing (in the case that you do get wet)<\/p> \n<p><b>Women in Canoe<\/b> is a 501(c)3 sporting organization that was established in 2000 by women, for women to realize their full potential starting with a healthy lifestyle in a supportive environment centered around the sport of dragon boating. Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task).

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game. Good sportsmanship will be emphasized. &nbsp;I'll do my best to take this club in the direction that the majority of members seem to want to go. I'll often ask for member input into various happenings in the club and I'll be receptive to ideas and criticisms by members regarding the club.

In this group, you'll do guided meditations, creative exercises, Haiku writing, and story-catching to get past your analytic mind and learned conventions and express your ideas more creatively from your spirit or intuition. To help you with this, I'll teach you the art of joriki, a Zen term for illuminating the light or spirit within and blending with the light of the source or spirit without. Learning to write from this place also helps you see the world from a more inspired and intuitive place, which in turn deepens the expression of your writing. <\/p>\n<p><b>This group has a heavy emphasis on spirituality, meditation, learning to live intuitively, and learning to connect with your own spirit from where your inspiration flows.<\/b> <b>It is not about manuscript critiquing or the business of publishing. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>About me: <\/b>I'm a a published author, an award nominated scriptwriter and journalist, with a career ranging from an Iraq War correspondent to lifestyle and spirituality feature writing. My work has been featured on BBC, NPR, McClatchy News and the Huffington Post. <\/p>\n<p>I combine my writing ability with these faculties to access the wisdom of the spirit to create work that is healing for me and for many around me. Using intuition to find that point of inspiration both inside and out in all circumstances has always been important in my work.<\/p>\n<p>Many people have been astonished with the originality and beauty of the work they have produced during these classes. While it can be intense, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and creative class. No writing experience is needed and sharing your writing with the group is entirely optional. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>A note on places:<\/b> (1) Places are limited to ensure everyone has the opportunity and attention needed to develop and explore your own inspiration and creativity. I also need to pay for the room in advance, so please pay via paypal [karen at celticmedium.com] or Meetup when you RSVP. (2) RSVPs must be received 24 hours before the meetup. (3) If you want to pay at the door, please email me to confirm that there is a place open. (4) Because of the logistics and overhead involved in handling a meetup, anyone who RSVPs yes and is a 'no show' twice will be removed from the group. <\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13188870,"name":"Karen Frances","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/highres_243801950.jpeg","photo_id":243801950,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/member_243801950.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/thumb_243801950.jpeg"}},"members":73,"name":"NYC Inspirational Writing Group","id":18653340,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Inspirational-Writing","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Inspired Writers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bergenfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433607773000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"dance-and-movement","name":"Dance and Movement","id":34160},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bergenfield-Social-Dancing-Meetup-160781512piNWhsGY\/","rating":4.85,"description":"<p>&nbsp; Join this group to improve your Salsa and Bachata Skills, and meet people. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>&nbsp; At The Salsa Connexion group, We organize events with live Salsa <br>&nbsp;music, free Salsa and Bachata lessons, and reduced or free admission at the best venues in northern New Jersey and New York.<\/p>\n<p> <br>&nbsp; The Salsa Connexion goal is to bring Salsa dancers, Salsa bands, Dance studios and Venues together. &nbsp; join us on Facebook &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/salsa.connexion1\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/salsa.connexion1<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_salsa_connexion\/\">https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_salsa_connexion\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check us out at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesalsaconnexion.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thesalsaconnexion.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br>&lt;br&gt;<\/p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/a\/2\/highres_441031906.jpeg","photo_id":441031906,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/a\/2\/600_441031906.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/a\/2\/thumb_441031906.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":160781512,"name":"Edwin Martinez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/5\/1\/highres_246528465.jpeg","photo_id":246528465,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/5\/1\/member_246528465.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/d\/5\/1\/thumb_246528465.jpeg"}},"members":310,"name":"The salsa connexion","id":18653343,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Bergenfield-Social-Dancing-Meetup-160781512piNWhsGY","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.9300003052,"who":"Salsa lovers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Clifton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433630288000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"esl","name":"English as a Second Language","id":182},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"engpremleague","name":"English Premier League","id":2588},{"urlkey":"speak-english-without-thinking-about-grammar","name":"Speak English without thinking about grammar","id":19277},{"urlkey":"english-language","name":"English Language","id":25698},{"urlkey":"esl-practice","name":"ESL practice","id":28980},{"urlkey":"speaking","name":"Speaking","id":41872},{"urlkey":"english-speaking","name":"English speaking","id":64439},{"urlkey":"english-speaking-club","name":"English Speaking Club","id":106309},{"urlkey":"english-speaking-social-group","name":"English Speaking Social Group","id":107882}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ESL-Workshop-over-Dinner\/","rating":0,"description":"Come practice speaking English in a friendly environment over dinner with other learning English also!

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to. I know how hard and lonely the journey can be, and wanted to create a group where anyone and everyone who might be going through their own ordeal can turn to for support. <\/p>\n<p>My hope is that we can become a family that grows together, and ultimately have an impact on each other\u2019s journeys.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186351000,"name":"Alan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/highres_247313427.jpeg","photo_id":247313427,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/member_247313427.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/thumb_247313427.jpeg"}},"members":62,"name":"Headaches, dizziness, anxiety and this thing I cant explain","id":18656568,"state":"NY","urlname":"thisthingicantexplain","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wanaque","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433737416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pagan","name":"Pagan","id":486},{"urlkey":"asatru","name":"Asatru","id":770},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"goddess","name":"Goddess","id":1052},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"drumcircle","name":"Drum Circle","id":2278},{"urlkey":"wiccan","name":"Wiccan","id":3862},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"heathen","name":"Heathen","id":15102},{"urlkey":"pagan-social","name":"Pagan Social","id":32452},{"urlkey":"earth-based-spirituality","name":"Earth-Based Spirituality","id":37479},{"urlkey":"everything-witchcraft","name":"Witchcraft","id":74176},{"urlkey":"norse-paganism","name":"Norse Paganism","id":89546},{"urlkey":"heathenry-or-heathenism-or-heathens","name":"Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens","id":102841},{"urlkey":"summer-solstice","name":"Summer Solstice","id":107023}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Pagans\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>New Jersey Pagans is the Largest Online and Offline Community in NJ We have been serving the community for over 15 yrs.

We are a running group supporting runners who are dealing with an injury or coming back to running after an injury.<\/p>\n<p> I know you don't want to be here... who would want to be injured instead of being out there running? Nobody! Unfortunately, the majority of the runners get injured at some point in their running career. I've got injured right after I started running 7 years ago. My Achilles tendon gave up on me. I was in a walking boot for&nbsp;several months followed by countless hours of PT sessions. It was painful, it was boring, and I felt shunned. I could not RUN!&nbsp;But in a way I was lucky. I met a girl who was a runner and&nbsp;injured as well. She had a stress fracture and she couldn't RUN either. We started to hang out and talk about our injuries, walk in Central Park instead of run,&nbsp;we discussed treatment options, our progress&nbsp;and plans after recovery. This was such a powerful bond between us: we are still best friends since and we are both recovered and running happy these days.<\/p>\n<p>You might want to find a similar place, or a friend who you can talk to about your injury and running and what the future holds for you. This is why this Meetup group was created. We welcome you here and we don't judge you. We understand that you are frustrated because of your injury and inability to do what you love the most: <strong>RUN<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to meet weekly and support each other. We can have discussions in a caf\u00e9 or we can have a slow stroll in the park. Whatever works! Come out, let's support each other in the recovery process, and before you know it, you will be back again&nbsp;in the park running!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founder of BIBSWITCH<\/p>\n<p><strong>BIBSWITCH<\/strong> - is an online platform that facilitates race number transfers between race organizers and runners who can no longer participate in an event they signed up for&nbsp;in advance.

All skill levels are welcome.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The class was started from the realization that there are not many affordable yoga classes with small group settings. The size of Lavender Space Yoga classes are usually 10 yoga practitioners max. You will move and breath in carefully curated music. The only thing you need to do is to reserve your space early and avoid last minute cancellation. Just come wearing something that's comfortable enough to move in and you already have everything you need.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the organizer:<\/strong>&nbsp;I am a yoga practitioner of over 6 years and a Certified Yoga Instructor. Outside of yoga, I have a full time job that I love and a supportive group of love ones. On most days, I am happy, but just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to manage. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share the practice with you. Teaching and practicing yoga are my hobbies so some weeks, I might not have any class if other priorities take over. When that happens, I usually find a guest instructor to lead the class, or not schedule one. Don't let that stop you from your personal practice. Let this group compliments whatever practice you already have (or help you start one if you are new to yoga). Reserve your sport today and try it out!<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/highres_438570892.jpeg","photo_id":438570892,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/600_438570892.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/thumb_438570892.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9323786,"name":"Linh Lanh","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/highres_247003866.jpeg","photo_id":247003866,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/member_247003866.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/thumb_247003866.jpeg"}},"members":163,"name":"Lavender Space Yoga Afterwork","id":18659774,"state":"NJ","urlname":"LavenderSpace","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Yoga practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bloomfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433836882000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"young-business-professionals","name":"Young Business Professionals","id":15530},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"networking-happy-hour","name":"Networking Happy Hour","id":46030},{"urlkey":"young-professional-women","name":"Young Professional Women","id":52083},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"young-professional-networking","name":"Young Professional Networking","id":79058}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Young-Professionals-Meet-and-Mingle\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for young professionals interested in networking in a local, fun environment.

I look forward to having NYC gamers and geeks over for some beers and gaming action.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/highres_438476731.jpeg","photo_id":438476731,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/600_438476731.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/thumb_438476731.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55522242,"name":"Chris Kooluris","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/highres_246893982.jpeg","photo_id":246893982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/member_246893982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/thumb_246893982.jpeg"}},"members":194,"name":"New York Classic Arcade Games Meetup","id":18660166,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-classic-arcade-games-Meetup","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Gaming Geeks"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Westfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433848781000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"family-and-friends","name":"Family and Friends","id":16929},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Playdates-Meetup-85266452inzdAFAs\/","rating":0,"description":"Fun play dates with our kids around the Westfield Area","lon":-74.3499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/highres_438707055.jpeg","photo_id":438707055,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/600_438707055.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/thumb_438707055.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":85266452,"name":"barbara frankowicz","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/highres_244098679.jpeg","photo_id":244098679,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/member_244098679.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/thumb_244098679.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Westfield Playdates Meetup","id":18660194,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Westfield-Playdates-Meetup-85266452inzdAFAs","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433860979000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"spoken-word","name":"Spoken Word","id":15191},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"literary-events","name":"Literary Events","id":18166},{"urlkey":"poetic-readings","name":"Poetic Readings","id":20335},{"urlkey":"open-mic","name":"Open Mic","id":26103},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"academia","name":"Academia","id":28269},{"urlkey":"prose-and-poetry","name":"Prose and Poetry","id":28832},{"urlkey":"academics","name":"Academics","id":32773},{"urlkey":"poets","name":"Poets","id":33467},{"urlkey":"poetry-readings","name":"Poetry Readings","id":44304}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rutgers-Summer-Session-Author-Reading-Events\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Rutgers-New Brunswick&nbsp;Office of Summer and Winter Session sponsors author reading events during the Summer and Winter Sessions.

It is not simply acquiring business cards and adding names to your \u201cLinkedIn\u201d account \u2013 it is taking the time to getting to know people in the areas in which you are interested or want to learn more about and staying in touch with them throughout your career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2.

Create a platform to practice the soft skills in a conversational and friendly setting. Most of us know our weaknesses, whether we need to be more organized or do a better job of meeting deadlines or simply prioritizing in a smarter way.

Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself. But what if that mirror has been neglected for hundreds of years? There are layers and layers of debris, dust, dirt and filth. And when you look into that mirror, all you see is the dust and the dirt that is accumulated, and all that you think is \u201cThis is me!\u201d But when you clean the mirror, little by little you start seeing the image of yourself. And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are. Meditation is for that purpose; prayers are for that purpose; spirituality is for that purpose: to cleanse our heart, to cleanse our life-style so that we can actually directly experience our own essence, which is eternal, full of knowledge and full of love<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/highres_438500682.jpeg","photo_id":438500682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/600_438500682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/thumb_438500682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":91531402,"name":"Dhyana","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/highres_246924137.jpeg","photo_id":246924137,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/member_246924137.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/thumb_246924137.jpeg"}},"members":302,"name":"Meditation & Kirtan: For New and Experienced - LES\/E.Village","id":18662790,"state":"NY","urlname":"meditation-group-LES","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Meditaters, Yogis, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433942491000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"advertising","name":"Advertising","id":690},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"digital-media","name":"Digital Media","id":17188},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"social-media-for-business","name":"Social Media for Business","id":37708},{"urlkey":"learn-social-media-marketing","name":"Learn Social Media Marketing","id":80837},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-analytics","name":"Digital Marketing Analytics","id":785142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Snapchat-Marketing-in-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"A place to come together and talk about Snapchat\u2122 marketing.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses. By being a member of the Network of Women in Business you will be able to increase your production and sales as a direct result of taking advantage of our training. You will be able to see a measurable difference in your bottom line. You will be able to say...\"Before I was on the Network my business was _____ and after joining the Network my business has increased by ____as a result of being on the Network.\"<\/p>\n<p>Never before has there existed an online space like the Network for Women in Business.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/highres_440579381.jpeg","photo_id":440579381,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/600_440579381.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/5\/thumb_440579381.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182635110,"name":"Mary S Newman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/highres_241910158.jpeg","photo_id":241910158,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/member_241910158.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/e\/e\/thumb_241910158.jpeg"}},"members":68,"name":"NYC Small Biz Boot Camp for Women","id":18667861,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Small-Biz-Boot-Camp-for-Women","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434122250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"magento","name":"Magento","id":16390},{"urlkey":"internet-ecommerce","name":"E-Commerce","id":27954},{"urlkey":"best-practices-for-high-performance-ecommerce","name":"Best Practices for High Performance eCommerce","id":117430},{"urlkey":"magento-designers","name":"Magento Designers","id":123242},{"urlkey":"magento-developers","name":"Magento Developers","id":123243},{"urlkey":"magento-enterprise","name":"Magento Enterprise","id":128799},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-technology","name":"eCommerce Technology","id":132503},{"urlkey":"online-retailers","name":"Online Retailers","id":135451},{"urlkey":"e-commerce-business","name":"e-commerce business","id":153685},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-workshops","name":"ECommerce Workshops","id":158613},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-social-media","name":"Ecommerce & Social Media","id":230121},{"urlkey":"magento-meetups","name":"Magento Meetups","id":676752},{"urlkey":"e-commerce-internet-marketing","name":"E-Commerce - Internet Marketing","id":788082},{"urlkey":"ecommerce-marketing","name":"eCommerce Marketing","id":805252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Connecticut-Ecommerce-Meetup\/","rating":4.66,"description":"<p>This is a group for ecommerce enthusiasts focused on Magento and other major ecommerce platforms.

We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!!

Early Russian cosmists proposed the idea of technological decompaction\/lightweighting of human body, which eventually wouldn\u2019t need an atmosphere and will be powered directly by solar energy. They call it \u201cradiant humanity\u201d - perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. <\/p> \n<p>Modern Cosmism brining to this doctrine ontological foundation, scientific structure and comprehension of possible technology. It's suggested that the profound nature of the reality is digital and it utilizes&nbsp; existential source code coming from Being which are using \u201cradiant humanity\u201d for its preserving and modification.&nbsp; Thus, we consider (for example) that Cosmological constant and precondition of Big Bang singularity were informationaly favorable mean guided. <\/p> \n<p>Cosmism will \u201cwork closely together\u201d with Transhumanism&nbsp; on transition period until consciousness uploading&nbsp; become possible. Then most likely humanity will be divided in two main directions: Earth base genetically improved biological civilization and departing digital society, creating new cosmic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/highres_439015680.jpeg","photo_id":439015680,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/600_439015680.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/thumb_439015680.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176456192,"name":"Vlad Bowen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/highres_245249871.jpeg","photo_id":245249871,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/member_245249871.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/thumb_245249871.jpeg"}},"members":68,"name":"Cosmism Meetup","id":18678518,"state":"NY","urlname":"Cosmism-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434549197000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"retire","name":"Retirement Planning","id":10026},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"financial-planning","name":"Financial Planning","id":15222},{"urlkey":"money","name":"Money","id":15580},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"retirees","name":"Retirees","id":20689},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"retired-men-and-women","name":"Retired Men and Women","id":49065}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wealth-Builders\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Welcome to New York Wealth Builder!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Are you worried that you will never achieve financial independence?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you spend more time planning your next vacation instead of your financial future?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Does thinking about your financial future cause you anxiety?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you look at your parents and tell yourself you better start planning now?&nbsp; <\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Most people do, which is why I wrote How to Avoid Bag Lady Syndrome: A Strong Woman's Guide to Financial Peace of Mind to help individuals achieve financial independence and take control of their financial world at an earlier stage in life.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>We plan to meet once a month to discuss any financial concerns or matters that are important to the group as a whole.

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

However, it was recommended that we each have $1000 to invest, since we will be learning how to invest.&nbsp;<\/span><span>We won't be doing any risky investments and you likely will not lose or make much money either. it is more about the learning process.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>NOTE:&nbsp;<\/span><span>THIS GROUP IS FOR YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN (age 20s-30s) WHO ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LEARNING. It will NOT be a get together where we flirt with the idea about actually learning. Only smart and motivated women need apply. I only want a few people in this group, so I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;approve of everyone. So just try to make it clear that you really want to join\/ are serious about learning\/ are an intelligent human being. If you are fun and cool thats a plus!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>:-)<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>you'll need to buy the book:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials\/dp\/0060555661\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434746466&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+intelligent+investor\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Intelligent-Investor-...<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The backstory of the creation of this group:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A few months go, I dated a guy who worked in finance. And we met up with some other friends, one of which &nbsp;worked in finance as well. While sitting at a table at the bar I overheard the friend talking about his girlfriend saying \"Girls just can't understand finance.\" Of course I chimed in and said WTF?! are you joking me?? OBVI if i had studied finance in college, then I would be sick at finance.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, after this conversation, I realized that I would like to learn more about this predominantly male-driven field that our entire society is so dependent on. I would like at some point in my life be adequately educated on the stock market so that when I'm a \"grown-up\" I can make my own intelligent financial decisions. I'd like to converse with wall street peeps and be able to comprehend what it is that they do. But mostly, I am a person that loves to learn, and I would like to acquire some knowledge about this topic in which I am so pathetically ignorant about.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/highres_438834779.jpeg","photo_id":438834779,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/600_438834779.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/5\/f\/b\/thumb_438834779.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":185020967,"name":"Arielle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/8\/8\/highres_245617768.jpeg","photo_id":245617768,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/8\/8\/member_245617768.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/8\/8\/thumb_245617768.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Girls Don't Understand Finance.

BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1.

In fact, since 1985, BNI members worldwide have exchanged over 15 Million business referrals, totaling over $8 Billion in new business.  In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business. ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Networking requires commitment. The most successful chapters of BNI are comprised of participants who are sincerely committed to helping one another through networking. They are a team. As a participant in BNI, you are responsible for complying with the policies and guidelines of the organization.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13744230,"name":"Joe Vaccarelli","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/highres_250343622.jpeg","photo_id":250343622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/member_250343622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/thumb_250343622.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"BNI Chapter 61","id":18701485,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Chapter-61","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Power Networkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435365531000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"linux","name":"Linux","id":188},{"urlkey":"robotics","name":"Robotics","id":682},{"urlkey":"css","name":"CSS","id":1973},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"microcontroller","name":"Microcontrollers","id":9903},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"web-security","name":"Web Security","id":15471},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"hacking","name":"Hacking","id":21123},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"arduino","name":"Arduino","id":39012},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Developers-Book-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A bi-monthly meeting for software developers to socialize over a pre-selected book.

If you have the same problem, let's meet up and swap food! We will meet bi-weekly and each member who RSVP's will make a dish that is equivalent to 5 cups of baby food (40 oz), package it in 10 small baggies, and swap with other members. Moms will be assigned a category for their dish before each meet-up: vegetable, carb, or protein. All food must be prepared using organic ingredients. Meet-ups will be at various times and can include bringing along the babies--weekday afternoons, morning coffee, weekend brunch, happy hour. All meet-ups will be in the BoCoCa area. There must be at least 5 RSVP'd moms for the meet-up to happen.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events.

To fulfill this aim we have created a peaceful city sanctuary located in the heart of Chelsea. Based on the books of the modern day Buddhist teacher, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, we present Buddha\u2019s teachings in an accessible manner that can easily be integrated into our modern lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Established over twenty years ago, hundreds of New Yorkers currently participate in our programs at the main center and throughout the city. The Center is run by volunteers who themselves are dedicated practitioners, and we have a warm and welcoming community. Please feel free to drop in for a visit. During opening hours there is always someone at hand who can answer your questions. In addition to the beautiful meditation room, you can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/bookstore-giftshop\/\">bookstore and gift shop<\/a>, or just spend time in our comfortable sitting and reading area. (Reference materials are available.)<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to participate in the activities at the center, we recommend that you begin with one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/study-programs\/general-program-classes\/\">General Program classes<\/a>.

Taught by qualified Western teachers, the meditation classes and Buddhist philosophy are very easy to understand and apply to our daily lives.

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

It's a mindset.&nbsp; It's the lost art of finding and creating opportunity. Instead of waiting for opportunities to float to the surface, break divers DIVE IN to the cold, icy, and treacherous shark-infested waters of resistance and find their 'chance of a lifetime' in the muddy bottom where no one else dares to tread. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT THIS MEETUP GROUP IS ABOUT: <br><\/b>The purpose of this Meetup group is to inspire members to pursue their dreams and find solutions to problems encountered along the way.&nbsp; Think of it as a gym membership for your life, offering engaging and inspiring meetups, seminars, and courses.&nbsp; This Meetup might also be considered life and business coaching in a fun group environment.&nbsp; Bottom line, studies have shown that we become the type of person we hang out with the most.&nbsp; So, come network, learn from, and be inspired by other winners just like you!&nbsp; . <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>If you have big dreams, great ambitions, and outlandish plans... JOIN US. <br>If you want help and encouragement figuring out how to get from Point A to Point B... JOIN US. <br>If you want to do fun things with other people with the same positive mindset as you... JOIN US. <br>If you think you are good at solving problems and offering solutions to others on this path called life... JOIN US. <br>If you want to be inspired and motivated to be more, do more, and live more... JOIN US. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>Life is tough.&nbsp; It's even harder when you're trying to accomplish big goals.&nbsp; And well, it's nearly impossible to accomplish those big goals entirely by yourself.&nbsp; So... why not share your goals and dreams with other winners and get their feedback?&nbsp; Why not encourage others with your unique perspective on their situations?&nbsp; EVERYONE needs encouragement and 'outside the box' thinking.&nbsp; This group can provide that encouragement and outside-the-box thinking.&nbsp; More importantly, you can provide that same fresh positive outlook to other group members.&nbsp; A rising tide raises all ships.&nbsp; So come join this rising tide of awesome people doing awesome things!&nbsp; Monroe Mann (Bio below, or Google him) and his fellow Break Divers will inspire you, encourage you, and force you to think in ways you never could have on your own.&nbsp; The result: your life is going to get a whole lot better. <br> <br><b>WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT AS A BREAK DIVING MEMBER:<\/b>&nbsp; <br>The basic framework of the group is meetings and get-togethers--&gt;inspirationally focused and moderated by motivational dynamo Monroe Mann, who many have called The Tony Robbins of the Entertainment World.&nbsp; Our meetings are ALWAYS inspiring; always hands-on and practical; always future focused (i.e. YOUR future); and sometimes have an adventure portion to them, i.e. a Citibike adventure in NYC that starts with a motivational pow-wow and finishes with an invigorating kick in the pants.&nbsp; <br> <br>The idea is that each Meetup will leave you encouraged and motivated, armed with solutions to whatever issues you are facing, and a battle plan for the next few weeks to tackle your goals and dreams.&nbsp; More often than not, you'll also make new friendships and reinforce old ones. &nbsp; <br> <span><br>Bottom line: the focus of Break Diving is simple--to guide members to become our best by inspiring one another to overcome difficult challenges on the road to reaching our dreams.&nbsp; In other words, this Meetup group's purpose is to help inspire you to DIVE into this crazy world and FIND YOUR BREAKS AND OPPORTUNITIES.&nbsp; We want you to become... a Break Diver!&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><b>Sound good?<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>If so, come join our collective of winners!&nbsp; If you are ready to grab life by the horns and finally do what you know you were meant to do, welcome to your new home, and welcome... to the first day of the rest of your life. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n<p><b>MODERATED BY:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> Monroe Mann, the founder of Break Diving, and a dude who epitomizes the philosophy of No Rules, No Excuses, No Regrets that he espouses.

Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.
