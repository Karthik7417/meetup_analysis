The CFB&rsquo;s mission is to increase voter participation and awareness, provide campaign finance information to the public, enable more citizens to run for office, strengthen the role of small contributors, and reduce the potential for actual or perceived corruption.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <em>The Voter Assistance Advisory Committee<\/em> (VAAC), was created by an amendment to the New York City Charter in 2010, to advise the New York City Campaign Finance Board on increasing voter participation and awareness, with special attention to groups and communities of residents that are underrepresented among voters, including civil rights and disabled groups. Under the leadership of its Chair, Art Chang, VAAC has also formed a <em>Digital Action Working Group<\/em> (DAWG) to identify and connect with partners in New York City&rsquo;s non-profit and technology communities who will help make this vision a reality.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<em>Art Chang, Chairman of the Voter Assistance Advisory Committee<\/em> and board member of the NYC Campaign Finance Board. Art is a serial entrepreneur who has helped create and restart over 30 private and public sector organizations. He is the founder and CEO of Tipping Point Partners, an \"institutional entrepreneur\" that serves as a seed investor and founder of software startups that build bridges between new technology and human needs, with a particular focus on using disruptive technologies to transform existing industries and government. Tipping Point believes that great software, applied intelligently, can result in positive social and economic change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n\n<br>\n\nArt serves as CEO of two of Tipping Point's portfolio companies: Cookstr, a technology company dedicated to cooking and food, serving as a data-centered \"Switzerland\" for rights holders; and AppOrchard, an iOS development and software company that bridges the gap between consumer Apple devices and the needs of large enterprises. He also serves as an advisor to Case Commons and to NYU&rsquo;s Catherine B. Reynolds Fellowship for Social Entrepreneurship.

Pit bulls and bully breeds are welcome! Don't have a dog? Adoptable dogs and fosters are welcome, as well and have them wear an adopt me vest!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mission Statement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of Positive Pittie Pack Walk (PPPW) is to create a structured environment to exercise and socialize our dogs. We recognize the importance of being responsible dog owners in order to raise confident, stable dogs, while working towards improving the image of pit bull type dogs. We welcome all types of dogs, and encourage owners who are working on reactivity and socialization issues to join us. Our dogs are always in training, and PPPW strives to be a constructive experience for every dog and his owner, regardless of what issues they are working through.<\/p>\n<p>In order to achieve our goals, all members must abide by the following rules. There will be no exceptions. Anyone who cannot abide by these rules will be asked to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No dog interactions:<\/strong> at no point before or during the walk shall dogs be permitted to greet one another, sniff each other, etc. There will be no physical interaction between the dogs whatsoever. It is the rhythm of walking together as a pack that is a positive, dog-social experience. To that end, structured pack walking can be an incredibly therapeutic, rewarding experience for a dog. However, if you are looking for a group where your dog can \u201cmeet\u201d new dogs and play, this is not the group for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minimum one handler per dog<\/strong>: one human per dog, and one dog per human. Extra humans welcome to help organize the pack!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Space:<\/strong> when we begin our walks, we will aim to keep approximately 5 feet between each dog. As the walk progresses, and the dogs get into the groove of pack walking, the distance between the dogs will likely reduce. Towards the end of the walk many dogs may end up walking side by side. Although, some dogs may require additional space throughout the entire walk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow Instructions:<\/strong> A few organizers will be navigating throughout the pack as we move along. If an organizer asks you or your dog to move up towards the front or hang towards the back, please do so, and don\u2019t take it personally! The goal is to find where each dog fits in to the pack most comfortably, and modify accordingly. Every dog will be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No Retractable Leashes:<\/strong> in order to ensure that each handler has proper control of his or her dog, please use leashes of no longer than 6 feet, and leave the retractable ones at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Local Laws and Ordinances:<\/strong> At no time will PPPW violate local leash laws, and all owners are expected to clean up after their dogs. Furthermore, please be sure that your dog has the proper licenses and vaccinations displayed on his collar before joining the group.<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/highres_227322262.jpeg","photo_id":227322262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/600_227322262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/5\/1\/6\/thumb_227322262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11680467,"name":"Jaime","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/highres_43507232.jpeg","photo_id":43507232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/member_43507232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/c\/4\/0\/thumb_43507232.jpeg"}},"members":217,"name":"Positive Pittie Pack Walk","id":3220942,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Positive-Pittie-Pack-Walk","category":{"name":"pets\/animals","id":26,"shortname":"pets-animals"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Pack Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1328217860000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"newcareer","name":"New Career","id":2790},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-owners","name":"Business Owners","id":15417},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"career-transition","name":"Career Transition","id":24110},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"legal","name":"Legal","id":42294},{"urlkey":"woman-entrepreneurs-business-networking","name":"Woman Entrepreneurs Business Networking","id":96909},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Small-Business-Support-Group\/","rating":4.89,"description":"<p>I started this meet-up group to form a support group for owners of small businesses.

Motorcyclers!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>QUEST! isn't an acronym. QUEST! is simply the gathering of people whom enjoy motorcycling adventures in whatever form they may appear! All types of motorcycles are welcomed. BMW, Ducati, Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, Victory, Honda, Indian, Can-Am, Yamaha, etc.. You must be licensed, insured, &amp; be a responsible experienced motorcycle rider.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Picture this in your mind\u2026 It\u2019s a warm, sunny Saturday morning in June. Temps are expected to hover around 75 degrees. You\u2019ve had difficult days at work last week &amp; between piano lessons &amp; baseball practice for the kids you\u2019ve been running non-stop. You just changed the oil in the car and just sat down to relax and maybe have an ice cold one. As you reach into the fridge for what you thought was the last can of the six-pack you realize that you polished it off the nite before. Arrrgh! You\u2019re on empty! As you grab the car keys to head out to the local 7-11 your smartphone chimes. It\u2019s an alert that a brand new QUEST! Meetup is happening in a few hours. There\u2019s a ride to a classic car show at Bear Mountain and the Budweiser Truck (along with the Smoothie King truck for you non beer drinkers) will be there! There will be live music too!<\/p>\n<p>You can almost taste the ice cold fizz of the King of Beer\u2019s sliding down the back of your parched throat\u2026but you haven\u2019t started your bike all week. The chrome is dusty, you haven\u2019t checked your tire pressure in weeks, and you need to top off your tank. The QUEST! riders are meeting to ride up to Bear Mountain together so you gotta BOLT!\u00a0 You say to yourself \"It\u2019s never just a \u201cMeetup\u201d with that group\" so this may turn out to be a great day! Where's my microfiber cloths?\u00a0 Where's my wallet?\u00a0 Where are the keys to my bike? I think I\u2019ll put a hold on that frosty brew until I see the QUEST! riders. It's more fun with that merry band of misfits anyway...\"<\/p>\n<p>You can finish the story above any way you choose. We've played it out a hundred times since we began riding motorcycles. Whether in New York, Louisiana, Florida or Colorado. Motorcycle riders enjoy others who also ride! Motorcycle riders are a very tight knit bunch. You don\u2019t have to know the lady rider at the traffic light sitting on her bike waiting for the light to change. You give her a nod and a smile through your helmet. She\u2019ll smile back, give you the two finger flip and off you go! That\u2019s why I created QUEST!. To answer the call to RIDE!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Excitement. Laughs. Pure enjoyment of the road. \u00a0These are some of the things you'll be a part of with Quest! \u00a0Below are a few more...<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Call to Adventure<\/strong> - Motorcycle rides will be our core focus! Long or short. Interstate or out of state. Day trips, over-nighters or weekend runs. QUEST! will also participate in some motorcycle rallies as a group. (Americade, Laconia, Roar to the Shore, etc..) With the \u201cofficial\u201d riding season lasting only seven (7) months, only active riders may suggest Meetups. We want you to be an <strong>ACTIVE<\/strong> member of QUEST! After 60 days of inactivity, riders whom have not participated in a ride will be removed indefinitely from the Meetup. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>I\u2019m not so interested in the number of riders whom join QUEST! as I am with building a great motorcycle riding collective<\/strong><\/span><strong>!<\/strong> Join to ride.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Journey<\/strong> \u2013 Launching out before dawn for a leisure ride to Pt. Pleasant, NJ for a day at the beach. Riding to Central Park Summer Stage to lounge on the Great Lawn to watch a free concert. Exploring twisties in the Catskills &amp; Adirondack Mountains of NY State. Riding through Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania &amp; Delaware Water Gap. From Springtime motorcycle maintenance opportunities where a certified motorcycle mechanic will be available to answer questions about your bike to Summertime rides for Maine Lobster and Philly Cheese Steaks in Philadelphia, to Fall foliage runs...the journey begins with QUEST!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Return<\/strong> \u2013 If you ride you know that visiting places by motorcycle is better than seeing them from the inside of an automobile. The freedom that motorcycling offers is like nothing else. The wind. The sounds. The scents. The open road. After a long day of riding we\u2019ll pause to gather our thoughts of the day and bid farewells. Each ride is expected to offer something new. Every return home to our families and loved ones is a successful ride. Come on out and join QUEST! As a QUEST! rider you will be more than just a rider. As adults we all have various experiences &amp; talents which may lend themselves to a better\u00a0QUEST! experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>QUEST! Motorcycle Group is built upon 5 Core Principles:<\/p>\n<p><strong>A) Individual Respect &amp; Integrity \u2013 If these 2 principles need\u00a0explaining then QUEST! isn\u2019t for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>B) Personal Safety \u2013 Assuring that your Motorcycle is in good working order and you're wearing proper motorcycling gear, equipment and that all your NYS DMV papers are current and in order. This not only protects you as a rider, but your fellow Quest! riders and other travelers on the road.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>C) Responsible Ridership - YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS &amp; BY REQUESTING TO JOIN QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS, UPON APPROVAL YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS THEREIN! \u00a0YOU RIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK! \u00a0QUEST! MOTORCYCLERS NOR ITS LEADERSHIP TEAM ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE HURT BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER PARTICIPATING ON A RIDE. \u00a0 RECKLESSNESS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED DURING A RIDE. \u00a0IF IT IS NOTICED THAT YOU ARE CAUSING A HAZARD TO OTHER QUEST! RIDERS YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE! \u00a0NO EXCEPTIONS!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>D) TeamWork &amp; Good Sportsmanship - No one rider\/member is bigger than the collective Group. Period!\u00a0 We are a team!\u00a0 We are one.\u00a0 No one gets left behind.\u00a0 We ride for fun! That's what the QUEST! experience is all about!\u00a0 Let's enjoy the QUEST!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>E) Respect For The Ride - Ride &amp; Have A Great Time!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In sum, my endeavor in creating QUEST! is that each journey impact member lives positively. Have you ever heard the saying \u201cRide to Live, Live to Ride\"? I believe every person may be at different places in their lives where anything can impact them richly or meagerly. With this new Meetup I hope riders who join will enrich my life &amp; yours\u2026but only if we\u2019re courageous enough to allow ourselves to truly embrace\u2026 the QUEST!<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/highres_97997042.jpeg","photo_id":97997042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/600_97997042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/9\/2\/thumb_97997042.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":120705822,"name":"winston","photo":{"photo_id":214685612,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/e\/c\/member_214685612.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/5\/e\/c\/thumb_214685612.jpeg"}},"members":256,"name":"QUEST!

I'm using the vast amount of Japanese pubs in the NYC area to recreate typical nights in Tokyo. Whats better then taking a couple hours to share some drinks and Japanese small plates and forget about the outside world with a good group? Maybe after we can belt out some tunes at a Karaoke house, or play some billiards, or go to another Izakaya?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Also, this group has become very diverse in the events we hold. Outside of weekly happy hours and weekend Izakaya hang outs we have participated in a wide variety of other cool, Japanese-centric things. Some of the events we have attended include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japan Block Fair<\/li>\n<li>Concerts (Japanese)<\/li>\n<li>Ramen Contests<\/li>\n<li>Sake\/Shochu Tastings<\/li>\n<li>Japanese food fairs and tasting events.<\/li>\n<li>Trips to the Japanese market.<\/li>\n<li>Other Asian restaurants.<\/li>\n<li>Izakaya crawls.<\/li>\n<li>Asian film festivals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>\"Is this a Japanese food club?\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No not exactly. Actually in Izakayas the spirits get the spot light. The food is complimentary to the sake, shochu, and beer. That doesn't mean you need to be a raging alcoholic to join. I myself am not a big drinker. But this is a pub based group. Still Japanese food lovers should do OK with this group too as we have visited many Japanese restaurants. I also like to include some nightlife when the group is not ready to go home.

The Deeksha brings about a growth in consciousness, thus heightening your life experience. The Deeksha changes emotions and perceptions or helps one be free of perceptions. This shift changes one\u2019s approach to challenges and opportunities since when perceptions change one no more perceives a problem as a problem. When perceptions change reality may also change because the external world is merely a reflection of the inner world. Higher perceptions and positive emotions create a more successful and fulfilling life.<\/p>\n<p>Effort does have a role in the Deeksha. While effort in the form of introspection, contemplation, asking the right question, having an intent, external doing etc. is also essential. The role of effort in this context is analogous to a plane speeding on a runway to take off, but the actual take-off also demands an appropriate wind current. The Deeksha is like the current that finally lifts the plane off the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Deeksha is given by the laying hands on the recipient\u2019s head or sometimes through intent. In this case, the giver holds the receiver in his or her awareness for a few minutes and allows the Deeksha to flow. In this way, the Deeksha can be given at a distance of thousands of miles or to a large group of people all at the same time. Deeksha unfolds differently in every individual as it depends on what the receiver may need it most.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the common benefits in receiving a Deeksha as reported by the recipients. One can experience greater effects of it with prolonged exposure.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Awakens creative potentials, abilities and intelligence <br> \u00b7 Increases ability to learn <br> \u00b7 Resolves inner conflict leading to inner peace and harmony <br> \u00b7 Brings love to relationships <br> \u00b7 Heals emotional hurts and reduces thought burden <br> \u00b7 Evokes affection, friendship and a sense of connectedness with the other. <br> \u00b7 Awakens compassion <br> \u00b7 Infuses vitality <br> \u00b7 Heals the body by healing the mind <br> \u00b7 Relaxes the body and relieves stress <br> \u00b7 Helps build love and appreciation for the body <br> \u00b7 Invokes auspicious energies <br> \u00b7 Removes blocks that hinder success <br> \u00b7 Makes possible a mental frame for abundance <br> \u00b7 Initiates a journey into experiencing unconditional love and joy <br> .

This is achieved by the process of the Oneness Deeksha \/Oneness Blessing which is a phenomenon sourced in the deep passion and the intent of Sri Amma &amp; Sri Bhagavan. <br><\/p>\n<p>Oneness Deeksha (aka) Deeksha is an energy transfer that brings about growth in consciousness. The level of consciousness of a person determines his\/her quality of life experience. For instance, one\u2019s experience of the ongoing recession, the ability to handle misunderstanding in relationship or a daughter\u2019s rebellious nature, what emotions surge through when diagnosed with a health problem, the level of connection with people around and the joy experienced, the intensity of passion at work etc., depend on one\u2019s level of consciousness. As consciousness rises, there is greater awareness, joy, love, togetherness, and focus in everything that you do and experience. <br><\/p>\n<p>The Deeksha neither requires practicing a particular way of living nor is an initiation into following a new path. It does not bind one to any philosophy or ideology. It transcends religious and cultural barriers from the fact that it only chooses to awaken each to his\/her own spiritual tradition by facilitating a neuro-biological shift, thus making religion a matter of personal choice and convenience. Hence people belonging to any faith or age group can receive the Deeksha.<\/p>\n<p>The Oneness Deeksha or Oneness Blessing can be received in person as a hands on the head energy transfer, it can be received in a chat session, via a video webcast, or even over the phone.<b> <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Group History<\/b>:&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>This group was NYC Stress Reduction &amp; Abundance Meditation Group<\/p>\n<p>This group was originally started by Rosario Mazer (Awakened Oneness Trainer) and&nbsp;Vera L.

We also have a highly educated population, great businesses, close proximity to NYC and\/or Philly and a well-developed educational system. However, if you look at lists of top states for entrepreneurship and innovation New Jersey never makes it. The great thing is that this is showing signs of changing.

Beyond my personal desire to hike the AT, this group is dedicated to everyone who is looking to section hike any part of the trail from Georgia to Maine (this started out as an NYC\/NJ\/CT group, but we are expanding this group to a National level). If you are an experienced backpacker, join the group and send me a message to become an organizer and attract folks to join you in your own adventures. Whether your trips last for a month or even just a weekend, this is the place to find others with the desire (but perhaps not the time) to hike the AT in its entirety in single trip.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking of joining us you will have the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>multi-day backpacking experience<\/li>\n<li>You will have your own gear (a backpack, a tent &amp; a sleeping bag)<\/li>\n<li>knowledge and skills to set up camp and prepare your own food in the back country<\/li>\n<li>Understanding of basic orienteering and first aid<\/li>\n<li>21 years of age or older<\/li>\n<li>A healthy appreciation for and respect for the outdoors<\/li>\n<li>$1 a year to chip-in for the cost of running this meetup group<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My vision for this group is that we would use the meetup as a forum to meet other backpackers in the area who would also like to section-hike the AT. Depending upon your speed, experience and skill level we will ultimately break down into smaller groups and plan multi-day excursions on the AT. If you have section hiked the AT in the past or even better if you have thru-hiked the trail we would be most pleased to have you in our group. Intermediate level backpackers especially are quite welcome (I'm intermediate level myself) - advanced beginners with a willingness to learn are also welcome to join us.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #ff0000\">If you are brand new to hiking and backpacking, this group is probably not going to be a fit for you.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About me: My trips will be organized in the Spring and Fall. My trips will be limited to 5 backpackers or less to preserve the wilderness experience for everyone.<\/strong> <strong>In 2012, over 20 days and 5 trips I've hiked about 250 miles of New York\/New Jersey\/Connecticut sections of trail. From here I've decided to continue northwards the 700 miles that I need until I reach Mount Katahdin. I'll be starting out in Salisbury, Connecticut in March or April, 2013 and aiming for Crawford, New Hampshire (I will make it to Wallingford, Vermont by the end of Spring).

If you are looking for better government service and fair taxes, you have to make sweeping changes in New Jersey's broken political establishment.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Jim Devine has proposed massive changes to cure the Garden State's plague\u00a0of 'politics as usual' ~ including plans to strip political bosses of their power and eradicate the corrosive influence of dirty money in government. This bold vision will not be popular with the political establishment but it is the right prescription for strong democracy and a better New Jersey.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Establish Fair &amp; Clean Elections<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n <span>Provide public funds matching small donor contributions six to one and equip other resources to all candidates who demonstrate broad public support and agree not to use or coordinate with dirty money in politics. Billionaires and corporations could still spend as much as they want, subject to full disclosure and a 200% tax that allows all candidates to compete on a level battlefield.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Stop Rigging Ballots<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n <span>Prohibit candidates from 'bracketing' or otherwise giving anyone an unfair advantage with respect to ballot position. Every American is entitled to equal protection of the law, so candidates picked by party bosses should not get preferential treatment in primaries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Cut Property Taxes in Half<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n <span>N<\/span>ew Jersey has more than 1,000 municipalities and schools districts that waste taxpayer money with duplication of services and inefficiency. We can have more responsive services and lower cost without the web of politics, corruption and confusion that we have today.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Curb Corporate Spending<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require corporations to obtain specific permission from shareholders prior to making any spending to influence legislation, elections, or public opinion and impose a 200% tax on such expenditures, which would fund Fair &amp; Clean Elections.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Open &amp; Honest<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require full disclosure of funding sources for all political communications. Impose criminal penalties on corporations that make factual misrepresentations in any communications intended to influence legislation, elections, or public opinion concerning government policy.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Legislative Reform<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Establish a full-time, unicameral legislature with 60 representatives, who would each be paid $95,000 a year, prohibited from receiving additional earned income and subject to strict conflict of interest rules.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Government Efficiency<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Evaluate local government consolidation, such as unifying police and other law enforcement services in a centralized administration to eliminate excess administration and duplication of services. Create a statewide system of free public schools for every child from the age of three to a college degree.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Polluters Pay<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Require corporations to rectify environmental damage on property they own or owned and lobby to reestablish the federal Superfund petrochemical industry tax system.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Resign to Run<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Stop politicians from using one elected office as a stepping stone to another, wasting your tax dollars and failing to do their job. Any elected official should be required to resign if he or she wants to seek election to another job.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>No Double Dipping<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Public officials should be barred from holding two or more jobs at taxpayer expense. Our current political establishment is rife with corruption and conflicted interests because politicians are looking out for themselves instead of us.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><strong>Term Limits<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n Career politicians have forgotten that public service is an honor and a privilege. It's time to stop lifetime tenure by making elections competitive and setting limits on the time anyone can hold an elected position.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color : #ff0000\">And much, much more!<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/3\/6\/highres_329088182.jpeg","photo_id":329088182,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/3\/6\/600_329088182.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/3\/6\/thumb_329088182.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":459921,"name":"devine","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/c\/5\/highres_3379141.jpeg","photo_id":3379141,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/c\/5\/member_3379141.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/a\/c\/5\/thumb_3379141.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Democrat Jim Devine for NJ","id":3481822,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Devine-Democrats","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.6100006104,"who":"Democrats"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1331816087000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"philosophy-discussions","name":"Philosophy Discussions","id":107569}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Philosophy-in-Manhattan\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p>This group will meet one Sunday per month.

In August of 2012, We decided to be better.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n We have a growing group of diverse individuals who like to help each other with issues we are faced with no matter what stage of the divorce process you are in - We welcome anyone who is contemplating, in or have completed the divorce process. We offer Compassion, Friendship and Fellowship and encourage new members to attend any gathering that you want to attend. You may attend any event that you feel like attending, We strongly encourage every member to attend the Monthly Support Meeting at least once.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n You will be warmly welcomed When you attend your first meeting, event or outing there is nothing to be nervous about. Depending where you are in the divorce process, you will meet someone, with a compassionate ear and who has been in similar situations in which you find yourself today.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n The Monthly Support Meeting usually last for two hours and your only cost is whatever you decide to eat or drink but you are not required. You don't have to talk much either all we ask is that you introduce yourself to the group and let us know what stage you are in the divorce process and what you would like to get out of our meetings.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n You will find that you will make lots of new friends who totally \"get\" what you are going thru and you can feel free to ask the group anything you want and see if anyone has an answer or an opinion.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.2900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/highres_149108772.jpeg","photo_id":149108772,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/600_149108772.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/4\/4\/thumb_149108772.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11202555,"name":"Stephen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/3\/4\/highres_11576884.jpeg","photo_id":11576884,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/3\/4\/member_11576884.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/e\/3\/4\/thumb_11576884.jpeg"}},"members":1108,"name":"New Jersey Complete Divorce Support Group","id":3495402,"state":"NJ","urlname":"CompleteDivorceSupport","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.5600013733,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1332078929000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"esl","name":"English as a Second Language","id":182},{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"jpop","name":"Japanese Pop","id":508},{"urlkey":"sushi","name":"Sushi","id":675},{"urlkey":"karaoke","name":"Karaoke","id":1193},{"urlkey":"expatjapanese","name":"Expat Japanese","id":9998},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-food","name":"Japanese Food","id":25545},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JKaraoke\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">This group has been created to bring people together that love to sing in both Japanese and English<\/span><\/strong> <strong><span style=\"font-size : medium\">to do Karaoke around New York City.\u00a0 Occasionally, we go to other music and cultural events, such as festivals, street fairs, concerts, etc.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"color : #800000\"><span style=\"color : #ae3333 ;

So I kept adding more and became stressed, but this method of subtraction &nbsp;was just the opposite. Instead of adding, the meditation provided a simple method of subtraction. After subtracting my past I began to change my mind; how I viewed the world. The method of subtraction allowed me to get rid of my 'self' and my self-centered mind which controlled my speech, thought, and action. Meditation with subtraction method allows me to live freely, without judgment and with gratitude.\" - Ben \/ Foster City, CA<\/p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditationusa.org\/\">Meditation<\/a> of subtraction method&nbsp;transcends the boundaries of all religions. It will elevate the human mind to the highest level of existence; the level of divinity. That is where peace is; the element that is meant to control the universe. Once we achieve a permanent peace, we can give it to others.\" -Dr. Charles Marcieca \/ International Association of Educators for World Peace. UN-NGO<\/p>\n<p>\"I have tried other forms of meditation in the past, but none stuck because they lacked the method of subtraction.

We have one mission: Unite startups to propel growth through collaboration. Successful startups almost always have one thing in common- they were able to talk to the right people and work with the right people. Through cultivating various key relationships and strategic alliances they were able to turn their idea into a reality. We are looking for all types of people- entrepreneurs, techies, creatives, socially conscious, non-profits etc. but everyone will have one thing in common which is the pursuit of their start up. Additionally, we don\u2019t want all start ups but rather the ones who are really committed to the idea of collaboration and building a community with a high caliber of people. When you walk in our doors you should be able to really feel the energy. Our goal is to get great people in the space to foster that environment and serve as a business incubator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : large\"><strong>The Action<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : large\"><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>At United Upstarts:<\/strong> we\u2019re going to take coworking one step further and actually focus specifically on Startups with an emphasis on how the community can help each other grow their businesses. Coworking naturally helps with this process because it encourages the exchange of ideas and sharing of resources. We will enhance this by hosting networking events, holding meetings to engage our members, and connecting our members with people who can help them expand their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>Prior to getting the space:<\/strong> we will start off by meeting at a coffee shop in NYC at least once a week (if not more) to share ideas, give input for the actual space, connect with fellow Upstarters, and find exciting entrepreneurial events to visit. We will also hold a weekly event simply to relax and unwind with our fellow coworkers over a few drinks. Our goal is to create an awesome coworking community before we actually open shop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : medium\"><strong>Future Coworking Center:<\/strong> We\u2019re shooting to open the center in the next 2 months (or so) when we are able to generate enough interest. We are looking for at least 10 full time members and 5 part timers. Initially spaces will be limited, so feel free to contact us if you would like to be one of our first 15 members. With your support we will make this a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #272727 ; font-size : large\">We look forward to meeting all of

The distance of the hikes and walks are normally between 5 to7 miles and range from level to difficult. We don't rock climb. We don't run marathon hikes. While some of our hikes can be challenging, we pace ourselves so that we can enjoy the serenity and peacefulness of the outdoors, the flora and fauna, and wildlife. &nbsp;On the morning of the hike, VSHC members meet at the Memorial Jr. High School parking lot in Valley Stream where we re-group and car pool to the hike. There is a ride share per person fee for those car pooling to the hike.

We meet casually and mostly for social, fun outings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. We also have some meetings that are talking circles where members can express feelings about loss without fear of advice or feedback. It is a way to be heard at such a difficult time in our lives. For more information on the talking circles, please click on the \"Pages\" section of our home page. There you will see many helpful concepts about how to navigate widowhood.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And we are so very sorry to anyone reading this who has lost a love. &nbsp;This club is specifically only for those who had a committed relationship where you lived together under the same roof. We say this so specifically because we have found those of us who lost that kind of partner have a special set of grief and loss issues. Getting together with others who fit that description is so helpful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An important difference in our club and many other Meetup clubs is this: we are NOT a dating club or website. Our goal is not to introduce you to future life partners or dates (although this can and does happen and we are happy when people find each other because they are members of this Club.) But, &nbsp;we are not a way to find a mate and we caution each member to please NOT use this club simply to find a date. This is upsetting to many members whose grief is so raw and whose need is to remember and grieve their loss - not to move on to dating and the suggestion they should forget their partner. Everyone needs to move into dating on their own terms and time. Club gatherings are not the place to work this through. You are of course welcome to write to members and ask them out for coffee or a date. But please do it in a respectful and delicate manner that our common situations require.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>So please join us! We ask that you fill out five simple questions on the profile and then we look forward to meeting you!

Urban Goddess hosts events which expose savvy modern women to ancient goddess wisdom in a strait forward, fun, playful, and non \"whoo-hooey\" or hippy dippy kind of way. Just the strait dope on living a life that is fierce, feminine and free! Urban Goddess is dedicated to educating and supporting women in embracing their highest potential. There are 3 primary powers of womanhood, and if you are not rocking all 3 in a balanced and integrated way, you are not reaching your true potential for achievement in love, work, and life at large. Are you ready to rock your feminine powers and live an extraordinary life?

We plan events that cater to EVERY aspect of your life. We workout together, travel together, save and invest together, pray together, solve problems together. We encourage and RESPECT our sisters at all times This group will strengthen your finances, your relationships, your health and emotional well-being and your spirit. We don't plan events, we create experiences. Designed to help you grow, explore the unique and live OUTSIDE \"the box\". Deep, introspective and amazing!...Not for EVERYONE...only women who want to be wiser, stronger, smarter...who are bold enough to SAY...I WANT MORE. More money, more respect, more love, more self-worth, more adventures, more of ME! My best self. When you bring your best self to every situation, you have the confidence to demand MORE. We limit our group numbers and focus on growth from the INSIDE out. We want active, committed members who ADD to the warm loving supportive atmosphere that we create at our events. We will be leaving meetup soon and expanding. Going National, as we will be featured in a book that we expect to be a National best seller. We have done a documentary and a talk show and our message is clear, BLACK WOMEN WANT MORE...and we will not settle for less than all of the best that life has to offer. If the group is closed, please email me to be added to the waiting list. As inactive and non committed members are removed, new members are added. We hope to MEET you soon...<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Black Women Who Want more are Spiritually grounded, emotionally stable, physically fit, financially poised, intellectually enlightened, politically conscious, socially gracious, black women who want more, demand more, deserve more of all of the best that life has to offer, on our journey to our best self.....<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/0\/8\/highres_120078952.jpeg","photo_id":120078952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/0\/8\/600_120078952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/0\/8\/thumb_120078952.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8250927,"name":"Rhoda","photo":{"photo_id":84625592,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/f\/8\/member_84625592.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/f\/8\/thumb_84625592.jpeg"}},"members":631,"name":"Black Women Who Want MORE- New York City","id":3876512,"state":"NY","urlname":"Black-Women-Who-Want-More-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Diamonds"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1337193789000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ultimatefrisbee","name":"Ultimate Frisbee","id":2077},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"co-ed-ultimate-frisbee","name":"Co-ed Ultimate Frisbee","id":88542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc_uf\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>We're a friends first, competition second group that focuses on friendship and networking through Ultimate Frisbee.<\/p>\n<p>Our focus is not to grow in numbers, but to get better together, keep our amazing environment and enjoy our time together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/3\/1\/highres_440365905.jpeg","photo_id":440365905,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/3\/1\/600_440365905.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/5\/3\/1\/thumb_440365905.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":47881452,"name":"Frankie B","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/f\/a\/highres_205149722.jpeg","photo_id":205149722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/f\/a\/member_205149722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/f\/a\/thumb_205149722.jpeg"}},"members":131,"name":"NYC Co-Ed Ultimate Frisbee","id":3878542,"state":"NY","urlname":"nyc_uf","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Frisbee People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1337211460000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"scrum","name":"Scrum","id":10043},{"urlkey":"agile-project-management","name":"Agile Project Management","id":21549},{"urlkey":"intrapreneurship","name":"Intrapreneurship","id":22141},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"corporate-entrepreneurs","name":"Corporate Entrepreneurs","id":474692}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Enterprise-Lean-Startup\/","rating":4.67,"description":"<p>We're a meetup for executives and managers that want to share stories about applying Lean Startup methodologies in the enterprise.

Are you ready to join the 3%? <br><\/p>\n<p>For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" &nbsp;By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. &nbsp;In 2014 BNI members&nbsp;passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Chapter 56 before. We're 47 (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. &nbsp;&nbsp;We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. &nbsp;If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 47 hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. We regularly see 5 figure deals close from referrals passed between members. There's a reason we're the fastest growing chapter (out of 60) in Manhattan. <br><\/p>\n<p>Are you our next success story?

However, I realized that all of the startup meetups fall into one of three categories: 1 - So early in the morning that no one is awake enough to have a stimulating conversation 2 - At a dark bar with a loud DJ making it impossible to actually talk 3 - Being given junk to eat and drink at someone's office.<\/p>\n<p>I'd like to take the valuable parts of these meetups but change the setup entirely. I used to meet and connect with people really strongly from activities at a gym, or playing a team sport. So let's try that! I'd like to meet a bunch of people working on cool projects\/companies, and play a fun and not overly-competitive sport together. While the intros we make at the beginning will spark interest in each other, it'll be the game play that actually create some kinships and a sense of communicating and working together. Not to mention we'd be getting exercise as opposed to the folks just meeting at the bar! I'm open to suggestions, but off the top of my head I think it'd be fun to meet once a week, and rotate what sport we play each week. Maybe to start, Ultimate Frisbee and Soccer?

The Par 3 Club is for golfers - and beginners - who want to enjoy the game playing at NYCs Par-3 golf courses or driving ranges (for example: Flushing Meadows Park &amp; Randall\u2019s Island). Our Rules: 1. Be friendly, courteous and encouraging to other members. 2. Obey the rules of the course. 3. Pay for your own golf course fee, food, golf balls or club rentals (if you do not have your own). 4. If you RSVP \u201cyes\u201d please be on time. 5. Have fun! Events with more than 4 participants will need to break up into smaller groups (most courses have a 4-player per group maximum.) The average round of Par-3 golf takes between 2 and 3 hours. For events at the driving range, stay as long as you like. Join us for a fun summer with new friends, green grass, trees and birdies - bogeys are okay, too! Don\u2019t forget your 9-iron, pitching wedge, and putter.

Our mission is to attract, educate, organize, and mobilize our fellow citizens to secure public policy consistent with our three core values of Fiscal Responsibility, Constitutionally Limited Government and Free Markets.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Core Values<\/strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Fiscal Responsibility<br>\n\n Constitutionally Limited Government<br>\n\n Free Markets<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Fiscal Responsibility:<\/strong> Fiscal Responsibility by government honors and respects the freedom of the individual to spend the money that is the fruit of their own labor. A constitutionally limited government, designed to protect the blessings of liberty, must be fiscally responsible or it must subject its citizenry to high levels of taxation that unjustly restrict the liberty our Constitution was designed to protect. Such runaway deficit spending as we now see in Washington D.C. compels us to take action as the increasing national debt is a grave threat to our national sovereignty and the personal and economic liberty of future generations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Constitutionally Limited Government:<\/strong> We, the members of The Tea Party Patriots, are inspired by our founding documents and regard the Constitution of the United States to be the supreme law of the land. We believe that it is possible to know the original intent of the government our founders set forth, and stand in support of that intent. Like the founders, we support states' rights for those powers not expressly stated in the Constitution. As the government is of the people, by the people and for the people, in all other matters we support the personal liberty of the individual, within the rule of law.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Free Markets:<\/strong> A free market is the economic consequence of personal liberty. The founders believed that personal and economic freedom were indivisible, as do we. Our current government's interference distorts the free market and inhibits the pursuit of individual and economic liberty. Therefore, we support a return to the free market principles on which this nation was founded and oppose government intervention into the operations of private business.<\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/b\/4\/highres_130855732.jpeg","photo_id":130855732,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/b\/4\/600_130855732.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/b\/4\/thumb_130855732.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6077502,"name":"Edward

When we let go of our individual focus, we are able to experience the dynamics of life to a much greater extent. This allows us to move beyond the interpretation (understanding) of humans as objects in the physical world and thus experience humans from within.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If we recognise that rather than meeting people, we encounter realities in which these people emerge, based on what they believe and defend, we develop a deeper compassion and understanding. We are aware that in this world we all wear a false smile.\u00a0<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Once we begin to comprehend the inner experiences of others, and to create through our being, we make a quantum leap in our communication. We lift communication up to the next level of evolution. This helps us to acknowledge the true cause of many conflicts, looking beyond the symptoms to the root of the problem.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Transparent Communication is a way of life in which different levels of consciousness as well as different levels of development and intelligence are included. It requires of us that we engage in an experientially oriented exploration of life. Only then will we truly learn to comprehend the world as a form of exchange in which we share a common space of interaction and learn to recognize the cosmic addresses of conscious content. We are in direct relationship rather than being distracted by symptoms. A high degree of interpersonal clarity is thus achieved, supporting our authentic expression, not to mention an expansion of the collective intelligence.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This is the basis for a Higher WE.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.thomashuebl.com\/<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/highres_239377632.jpeg","photo_id":239377632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/600_239377632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/3\/0\/0\/thumb_239377632.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7706568,"name":"Robert Brugger","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/5\/5\/highres_243383381.jpeg","photo_id":243383381,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/5\/5\/member_243383381.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/5\/5\/thumb_243383381.jpeg"}},"members":102,"name":"Transparent Communication NYC","id":4105292,"state":"NY","urlname":"TCPNYC","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1340068341000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"gaypros","name":"Gay Professionals","id":4270},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"gay-male-social-group","name":"Gay Male Social Group","id":55541},{"urlkey":"gay-mens-fitness","name":"Gay Mens Fitness","id":99285},{"urlkey":"gay-men-over-40","name":"Gay Men Over 40","id":172590}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gay-Mens-Hiking-Group\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>Are you a gay man over 40 who loves to hike?

I am an intermediate\/advanced player who has played for several years at courts all around the city. I enjoy playing with all types of players and learning from their play, I've also done a bit of research and picked up several different workouts and drills from varying sources such as books, tennis magazines, internet, tennis channel, etc... Amongst other things I am a certified personal trainer having worked at Equinox in past. We will be conducting meetups 2-3 times a week which are geared to improve your cardio, footwork, groundstrokes, volleys, overheads, serves, returns, lobs, and overall court awareness.\u00a0 Essentially a professional tennis workout regime.

You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/9\/e\/event_151317502.jpeg\" width=\"90\" height=\"57\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our website:<\/strong> <span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/7487.toastmastersclubs.org\/\">http:\/\/7487.toastmastersclubs.org\/<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/0\/2\/event_150926882.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/NutleyToastmasters\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/NutleyToastmasters<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/5\/a\/event_150927482.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visit our Facebook FanPage:<\/strong> <span style=\"color : #3366ff\"><strong>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NutleyToastmastersClub<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong>Come and join us and have some FUN while improving your communications skills!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><strong><br>\n\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/highres_142667452.jpeg","photo_id":142667452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/600_142667452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/5\/c\/thumb_142667452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8712719,"name":"Edna Sloan","photo":{"photo_id":32731022,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/2\/e\/member_32731022.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/2\/e\/thumb_32731022.jpeg"}},"members":317,"name":"Nutley Toastmasters Club","id":4374912,"state":"NJ","urlname":"7487-toastmastersclubs-org","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.8199996948,"who":"toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1343144159000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scifiwriting","name":"Science Fiction Writing","id":221},{"urlkey":"scifi","name":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy","id":317},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"roleplaying-games-rpgs","name":"Roleplaying Games (RPGs)","id":16425},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"film-festivals","name":"Film Festivals","id":18495},{"urlkey":"science-fiction","name":"Science Fiction","id":18864},{"urlkey":"geeks-nerds","name":"Geeks & Nerds","id":32623},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Philip-K-Dick-science-fiction-Film-Festival\/","rating":4.16,"description":"<p>To explore the ideas of the science fiction author Philip K Dick\u00a0 Ray Bradbury, Jorge Luis Borges.

They all emphasize love as being the foundation of life. Are they talking intimate love or did romance somehow hijack the true nature of love? Everybody sings about it, talks about it, and writes about it - but what does love really mean and how can it help you live a better life and create a better world? This meetup is a philosophical exploration of the practical side of love - what does it mean to cultivate true love for yourself, other people, and our planet. Love isn't just a fuzzy concept that dating sites talk about. It's the fundamental motive force behind humanity. Every person wants to be loved and do what they love. Every great accomplishment is the product of people doing what they love. Each meetup is a guided discussion around a particular facet of love, be it compassion, service, forgiveness, kindness, following your heart, etc. We will explore how to apply ancient wisdom to modern human living. This group is open to all.

Bring your own creativity into the group, and present your ideas. Showcase it ourselves, maybe organize a show? I don't know! Lets go crazy, because this is the city where everything is accepted. NYC!<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration of MUSIC: If you are a pianist, guitarist, composer, or singer(English\/Hindi) we can have a meet and try to make something together. Composers can create music, and musicians can try to execute it through instrument or voice. We can have karaoke sessions to showcase singing talent or practice it yourself. Try to sing your favorite songs of favorite singers. If you play an instrument then practice and perform a song that you like!<\/p>\n<p>Acting, and dancing isn't all that this page is about. If you write stories, then we can shape it into a cinematic script. If you love to capture beautiful footage of people, documenting life, actions, or reactions then you may have a really good eye for shooting a scene. If you are a DJ, or a synthesizer, then you must have a good idea of what music goes with a certain mood\/feeling and that could work great as a music director\/composer. And if you feel you can put all this together creatively then film direction.<\/p>\n<p>Film comes with a lot more in the package: Lighting, Sound recording on set or in studio, script supervising(making sure that each scene is being shot according to the script or within the limits of the theme so it doesn't sway away), production designer\/Art director(looking for the best locations for each scene, setting up the look of the room or location, deciding props that should be used by the actors), if you love to do make up, or design clothes and a lot more.

We provide newcomers to Buddhism as well as established practitioners an opportunity to study, cultivate, learn practices and meditate. Buddhism provides us with tools to discover the true nature of reality as we analyze and reflect upon our lives to understand the causes and conditions that shape the world around us, discover how to uproot negative emotions and habitual patterns, and learn how to cultivate true inner beauty, happiness and peace of mind. We study teachings and learn ancient practices that show us how to: * Purify negative karma and cultivate pure positive karma * Remove inner and outer obstacles that block worldly and spiritual goals * Uproot negative emotions and habitual patterns * Meditate and cultivate a stable mind * Train the mind in loving-kindness and compassion * Cultivate true inner beauty, happiness and peace of mind Our deep explorations of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism through cultivation practices, discussions and meditation are shaped by ongoing teachings of Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a humble but highly cultivated Chinese Vajrayana yogi, as well as various Tibetan Buddhist teachers.\u00a0Come join a friendly group as we support each other in this essential journey through online communication and face-to-face meetings.

The huge variety of seasonal foods results in an appreciation of when the different foods are in season and their suitability for providing satisfaction at the time of year when their quality is at its best. Care is taken to make the prepared foods very digestible. Lightness and transparency through fine simplicity is my favourite part of a Japanese meal.<\/p>\n<p>I choose a specifically practical approach for teaching technique, so you will be pleasantly surprised at how easily fine flavor and visual delight can be achieved at your own home after my cooking class.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing in my class is that you are having fun while you learn. After cooking is done, you will enjoy the dishes you cooked. The cooking classes are held in the East Village.<\/p>\n<p>The price of each class is around 50 dollars. Please contact at info@tokyotwilight.com for more details. Private, semi private or group classes are also available.

What is consciousness? We all know the immediate experience of what it is to be conscious, but from a scientific perspective what on earth it is!? Is it as Francis Cricks \"Astonishing Hypothesis\" suggests - a phenomena completely explainable as the result of complex neuronal interactions, or is it a quantum mechanical phenomena ? Perhaps its a self-referential computer program running in the brain, or just an elaborate illusion - or is consciousness actually the ultimate underpinning of all reality... ? So far little consensus has been achieved on which of these wildly diverse approaches (if any) is correct. However, ongoing improvements in brain scanning technologies and developments in artificial intelligence ensure that the field continues to rapidly evolve, so the future promises some exciting developments! The group will provide a forum to review and informally discuss some of these wide ranging theories with video viewings and book reviews and also (hopefully) some in person lectures from local experts (given that NYC academic institutions are a hotbed of neuroscience and the philosophy of mind). We'll also discuss some of the potential implications of a successful scientific theory and what kind of tools it might lead to for enhancing consciousness in the future.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/highres_148722962.jpeg","photo_id":148722962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/600_148722962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/d\/2\/thumb_148722962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9328982,"name":"Tracey Lall","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/f\/4\/highres_107085812.jpeg","photo_id":107085812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/f\/4\/member_107085812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/f\/4\/thumb_107085812.jpeg"}},"members":130,"name":"Astonishing Hypothesis - science of consciousness meetup","id":4538322,"state":"NY","urlname":"Astonishing-Hypothesis-science-of-consciousness-meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cosmists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"White Plains","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1344889664000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaypros","name":"Gay Professionals","id":4270},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"gaycouples","name":"Gay Couples","id":4605},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-couples","name":"Lesbian Couples","id":22783},{"urlkey":"lgbt-parents","name":"LGBT Parents","id":33601},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheLOFTLGBTCenter\/","rating":4.62,"description":"<p>The LOFT is a meet-up location for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and allied communities.

This is not a superficial singles discussion; it\u2019s an exclusive social experience based on the concepts of Erich Fromm, Abraham Maslow, Karen Horney, &nbsp;Albert Ellis, and other greats in humanistic philosophy and psychology. The philosopher Martin Buber said that life is an encounter with oneself, others and nature, but we need to have these encounters enhance warmth, mutual understanding and health. In this series of Meet-ups, on the third Friday of each month, we will explore all the many aspects of interaction and relationships that ultimately make our lives more gratifying and effective. With guidance from an experienced group moderator, participants will create an experiential dialogue of sharing and learning, followed by relaxed socializing and light refreshments. The program is based on many years of highly successful development at the Humanist Foundation; its leader and counselor Joseph B. David has professionally conducted hundreds of humanist growth workshops and seminars. The hectic pace and complexities of today\u2019s life make this program a welcome setting for meeting like-minded people and exploring ideas together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/highres_157403152.jpeg","photo_id":157403152,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/600_157403152.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/7\/0\/thumb_157403152.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":35230322,"name":"Alyson Ben David","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/7\/6\/highres_37335222.jpeg","photo_id":37335222,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/7\/6\/member_37335222.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/7\/6\/thumb_37335222.jpeg"}},"members":417,"name":"Humanistic Interpersonal Meetup","id":4849852,"state":"NY","urlname":"Humanistic-interpersonal-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Humanist Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1347317408000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"zumba","name":"Zumba","id":15451},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"trying-new-things","name":"Trying New Things","id":28744}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ZUMBA-Montclair-NJ-FUZE-Fitness\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p><span><strong>If you love music, dancing and interested in adding alittle SPicE to your workout routine ~ then this Meetup Group is just right for YOU!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>It's a place where you can GET FiT, have a blast and meet other local FiTness Lovers in a fun-loving, health-conscious and inspiring atmosphere.

It seemed that there was a place for a group that gives programmer-level (but not too scary!) introductions to languages that members have always heard about but haven't ever delved into. Some languages are too obscure to have their own Meetup groups, but even for the ones that aren't, sometimes you want an overview of the key features of a language and what makes it special, which you might not always get at a Meetup devoted to that language, among people who are already familiar with it.<\/p>\n<p>As of this writing, we've had talks on (in addition to the languages listed above) Python, OCaml, Go, JavaScript, Smalltalk, J, and Perl. If you've got a language you'd like to hear on intro on, join the group and make a suggestion!<\/p>\n<p>We have a slack channel where we hang out and chat about programming languages, tech, and other related items.

If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again. -<em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/3\/2\/highres_185731282.jpeg","photo_id":185731282,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/3\/2\/600_185731282.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/3\/2\/thumb_185731282.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14637824,"name":"Nikki","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/3\/6\/highres_79558422.jpeg","photo_id":79558422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/3\/6\/member_79558422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/3\/6\/thumb_79558422.jpeg"}},"members":85,"name":"The Afterburn- New York's Adventure Seeking Group","id":5208682,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Afterburn","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Burners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1349197034000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"swingdancing","name":"Swing Dancing","id":3009},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"zumba","name":"Zumba","id":15451},{"urlkey":"weight-loss-support","name":"Weight Loss Support","id":15538},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dance-fitness","name":"Dance Fitness","id":18226},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCTWERKOUT\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p><span>This is a group design to help you find the best most interesting and fun Dance Fitness class in NYC.

All levels are welcome, especially those who are already fluent in French ! It would be awesome to meet a few times a month, locations to be determined (there is an amazingly delicious French restaurant in town ...hint hint:). I started this group because I traveled to Paris a few months ago with my husband and absolutely fell in love with this amazing city. Since our trip, I've been learning French, eating lots of French food, listening to Gypsy Jazz and watching every possible French movie I can get my hands on! So who's with me???? Come -- speak French, meet new friends, mange, drink a lot of wine and have un tres bon moment!

Events include but are not limited to: dining out, pot-luck dinners, meeting for a movie, attending musical performances, museums, live theater, &nbsp;and other cultural events, or anything else our members are interested in.

For me, this group is for survivors who are interested in a survivor social group to spend time with (coffee, drinks, movies, hiking, etc) as opposed to a pure grief counseling\/support group. If the event is still very raw and\/or recent for you, then I don't believe that this social group would be the group for you. There is an excellent support\/griefing group that I've attended in NYC and you can get more information here: http:\/\/www.samaritansnyc.org\/safeplace.html<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/4\/a\/highres_166788202.jpeg","photo_id":166788202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/4\/a\/600_166788202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/4\/a\/thumb_166788202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2920615,"name":"richard veal","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/2\/a\/highres_11694058.jpeg","photo_id":11694058,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/2\/a\/member_11694058.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/2\/a\/thumb_11694058.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"Survivors of Suicide Social Gathering Group","id":5283192,"state":"NY","urlname":"Survivors-of-Suicide-Social-Gathering-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Survivors"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Oakland","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1349656323000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-development","name":"Commercial Real Estate Development","id":70642},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-investments","name":"Commercial Real Estate Investments","id":70646},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-financing","name":"Commercial Real Estate Financing","id":71534},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-solutions","name":"Commercial Real Estate Solutions","id":71536},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-analysis","name":"Commercial Real Estate Analysis","id":73491},{"urlkey":"real-estate-group-investments","name":"Real Estate Group Investments","id":73492},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-networking","name":"Commercial Real Estate Networking","id":77426},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-management","name":"Commercial Real Estate Management","id":77427},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate-brokerage","name":"Commercial Real Estate Brokerage","id":77429}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Commercial-Real-Estate-Industry-Networking-NYCREIN\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>RELATIONSHIPS MATTER....

It's true, some of the best jobs are never advertised. Many are filled by successful job seekers who networked with the right people and got the job before it was ever advertised. Employers love referrals and first look to tap their own workers for people they know that can fill open positions. It's cheaper and provides for more quality employees. People do business primarily with people they k9now and like. Resumes and cover letters alone are often too impersonal to convince employers to hire. Networking makes you a recommended member of a much smaller pool. Networking leads to information and job leads, often before a formal job description is created or a job is announced. There is more to successful networking than just talking to your friends. To be a successful networker you must have as many contacts as possible hear your pitch and understand that you are in the job market.<\/p>\n<p>FB LINK - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NyCareerGroup<br><\/p>\n<p> <br> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/highres_170120322.jpeg","photo_id":170120322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/600_170120322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/6\/2\/thumb_170120322.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":65115592,"name":"Maria","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/2\/1\/highres_245270977.jpeg","photo_id":245270977,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/2\/1\/member_245270977.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/2\/1\/thumb_245270977.jpeg"}},"members":2450,"name":"NY Career Meetup","id":5413052,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Career-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Perfect Professionals"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1350391839000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"basketball","name":"Basketball","id":3597},{"urlkey":"wbasketball","name":"Women's Basketball","id":8124},{"urlkey":"mens-basketball","name":"Men's Basketball","id":20991},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"pick-up-basketball","name":"Pick-up Basketball","id":22261},{"urlkey":"adult-basketball","name":"adult basketball","id":23591},{"urlkey":"indoor-basketball","name":"Indoor basketball","id":36177},{"urlkey":"basketball-lovers","name":"Basketball Lovers","id":57627},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-basketball","name":"Co-Ed Adult basketball","id":83509},{"urlkey":"coed-recreational-sports","name":"Coed Recreational Sports","id":89956},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"coed-basketball-pick-up","name":"Coed Basketball Pick Up","id":117494},{"urlkey":"coed-pick-up-basketball","name":"Coed Pick-up Basketball","id":1172162}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startup-Basketball\/","rating":4.48,"description":"<p>Open run basketball games open to the greater NYC tech and entrepreneurial community.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/d\/2\/highres_213880402.jpeg","photo_id":213880402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/d\/2\/600_213880402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/d\/2\/thumb_213880402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13512939,"name":"Jarett Sims","photo":{"photo_id":206752852,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/e\/7\/4\/member_206752852.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/e\/7\/4\/thumb_206752852.jpeg"}},"members":1098,"name":"Startup Basketball","id":5416972,"state":"NY","urlname":"Startup-Basketball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1350394671000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wedding","name":"Wedding Planning","id":209},{"urlkey":"weddingvendor","name":"Wedding Vendor","id":9231},{"urlkey":"wedding-photography","name":"Wedding Photography","id":17886},{"urlkey":"weddings","name":"Weddings","id":21742},{"urlkey":"local-wedding-vendors","name":"Local Wedding Vendors","id":24299},{"urlkey":"wedding-event-professionals","name":"Wedding & Event Professionals","id":36071},{"urlkey":"wedding-videographers","name":"Wedding Videographers","id":76853},{"urlkey":"engagement-photography","name":"Engagement Photography","id":78004},{"urlkey":"wedding-venues","name":"Wedding Venues","id":133052},{"urlkey":"new-york-wedding-professionals","name":"New York Wedding Professionals","id":702182},{"urlkey":"high-end-weddings","name":"high-end weddings","id":1409602},{"urlkey":"manhattan-weddings","name":"Manhattan weddings","id":1409612},{"urlkey":"cinematic-wedding-films","name":"Cinematic wedding films","id":1409622},{"urlkey":"chic-wedding-dresses","name":"Chic wedding dresses","id":1409632},{"urlkey":"wedding-florists","name":"Wedding florists","id":1409642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Wedding-Professionals\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is an exclusive networking group for Wedding Professionals who serve the high-end wedding market in Manhattan.

Mr. Nyland was a serious student and teacher of Gurdjieff\u2019s ideas for over 50 years, andtoday his group continues, providing a vital source for the study and practice of work on oneself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EVERYONE IS WELCOME!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the time and place of these meetings call the Chardavogne Barn at <span style=\"color : #ff0000\"><span><span><span>845-258-4655<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> For more information regarding G.I.

Nyland visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyland.org\">http:\/\/www.nyland.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In 1924 Mr. Nyland heard Gurdjieff speak during his first visit to United States, and soon became an active member of the new group set up by Gurdjieff in New York, with A.R. Orage at the head. From that beginning, Mr. Nyland became dedicated to the practical application of Gurdjieff\u2019s Ideas for the rest of his life. He traveled several times to France to work with Gurdjieff, helped Gurdjieff when he made his various tater trips to America, and continued with his own personal efforts to apply what Gurdjieff taught as self-development, or work on oneself.<\/p>\n<p>Near the end of his life, Gurdjieff asked Mr. Nyland to start a group in America, for which he would receive special material every week. After Gurdjieff died in 1949, Mr. Nyland was one of the founders and trustees of the Gurdjieff Foundation. He remained active in the Foundation until he formed his own independent group in the early 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 1960s, Mr. Nyland established a center in the country, in Warwick, NY, where he purchased property now known as <span>Chardavogne Barn<\/span>.

teacherprenuer and author of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greggfesta.com\">RE@LWorldEDTECH<\/a> blog. &nbsp;I have assumed the organizer role for this meetup group as of March 27, 2016. In doing so, I have revised the name to Tri-State Education Innovators so it is inclusive of all those in NY\/NJ\/CT working hard to innovate in education from the inside AND outside.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a veteran educator and entrepreneur with a combined 20 years of successful and not so successful experience leading innovation in education , I've found that the most useful aspect of meet ups is the symbiotic relationships developed among its diverse membership and the resultant outcomes that occur from those interactions. Going forward, I will focus our monthly meetups on bringing the brightest minds inside and outside of education together to share ideas, concepts and real world practice with the purpose of disruptively innovating the learning space. If there are those in the group who would like to participate in organizing meetups with a focus on the current trends in the learning space (makerspaces, STEM, open source learning resources, design thinking, innovative learning spaces, blended learning, personalized and adaptive learning, LMS, etc) please be sure to reach out to me so we can collaborate around your idea.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I will be working hard to create and host one of the following monthly meetup formats each month beginning in late April (date TBD) .<\/p>\n<p>1) <b>Innovator Speed Dating<\/b> - Startups \/Teacherprenuers can test their ideas\/prototypes through a 10 minute demo and discuss while gaining valuable and constructive development feedback from veteran educators. Let's see whose idea makes it the alter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2) <b>Innovation in the Round<\/b> - This Socratic meetup format will give participants an opportunity to submit, discuss and debate real world problems in education, while proposing solutions that may or may not disruptively innovate learning now or in the future. Let's find out together!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>I am also working to jumpstart what I am confident will be an annual summer \"must go to\" event for educators, teacherprenuers and EdTech startups. Sort of the South by Southwest for Education Innovators. I envision that this meetup will be based on the organic podcamp model where those attending will create their own learning experience based on interest and knowledge\/skills as they go.

Would you like to learn to get the joy from poems you get from other works of art without going through English Lit 101 again? If your answers are yes I can help. It started with a friend whom I met in discussion groups of Joyce\u2019s Ulysses and Proust\u2019s Remembrance of Things Past. He loved literature and music (he was a Jazz musician and is very knowledgeable about classical music as well). Yet, though he knew there was great beauty in poetry, he just didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d it. We started discussing poetry in general and soon began weekly discussions of specific great poems. The challenge for me was how to make poetry come alive to him yet cover the critical components of poetry in a meaningful and interesting way\u2014to help him enjoy the beauty in Poetry that he enjoyed so much in literature and music. These discussions have been a great success and a great joy to both of us. He has come to love poetry with the same passion he has felt for music and literature. Now I\u2019d like to share with others what we learned. So, I am starting a Peotry discussion group\u2014I will facilitate but it\u2019ll be discussions not lectures or lessons. Together we will learn to understand and then love great poems. If you are interested, just join the Great Poetry group on Meetup. As soon as we have 5 or more members I will contact you and we\u2019ll pick a schedule and a venue in Manhattan and then we\u2019ll start.
