Going to a gym can be intimidating. Between all the machines, learning how to use them, doing the exercises correctly and in the right quantities almost takes a degree to figure out. Personal training was expensive, and even the newer offerings like Crossfit were both very intense as well as expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the challenge of motivation and commitment. All but the strongest minds have the strength to continue working out for any period of time on their own. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, and my highest respect to those that can do it, but for many of us, solo workouts, be it a walk, jog, or other exercise regimen, just lack the interaction and support that people want and need, especially beginners.<\/p>\n<p>I have struggled with my fitness over the years, between my weight and my physical abilities. While i'm no athlete, I have worked my way through numerous programs and exercise regimens, from gym memberships and personal training, to martial arts, boot camp, and even Crossfit. Most of those \"experiments\" lasted a few months at best to a few weeks at worst.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some I did stick with for a year or longer, and the common bond with those was the ability to achieve milestones and see my improvements more regularly as well as having a group of like minded people around me for support and encouragement. People who were more fit than I encouraging me, and people who were at my level, sharing in the experience. It also provided me an opportunity to help the newer people when they came aboard, to encourage them and give them the confidence that they can do this too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is where The Long Island Fitness Team (LIFT) comes in. Were a community of people who want to be fit. We're not the athletes and body builders of the world, just everyday people who are looking to become more fit, are looking for a program that will help them be consistent and keep them motivated, will help them improve their overall level of fitness, which will include cardio as well as strength and conditioning, and do so in a fun, team spirited, but very individualized and effective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We cater to the beginner, Why? Because once you set up a routine, and once you understand what to do, and how to do it, when you know how to break down an exercise, or scale a workout to your own strength and ability, continuing is easy. You'll be more interested in getting out and exercising than taking it easy and doing nothing. You'll miss it. At that point, you'll also be able to make your own decision as to what kind of program you want to be a part of. Perhaps you'll go to a gym, do Yoga or Zumba, Boot Camp or Crossfit or even stay with us at LIFT. Who knows, maybe you'll workout alone. The importance here is that you got yourself to a level where YOU can decide how to stay fit.

Through all of that, we can find our way to an enlightened sexuality.<\/p>\n<p>--- Marc Gafni&nbsp; <\/p>\n<br>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Topics explored:&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>- Understanding the powerful relationship between the erotic and the holy,<\/p>\n<p>- The difference between ordinary and extraordinary sexing,<\/p>\n<p>- Sexuality as a great wisdom teacher and how to apply the lessons to every aspect of life,<\/p>\n<p>- Sex without shame,<\/p>\n<p>- Relationship as spiritual practice,<\/p>\n<p>- The secret to manifesting an outrageous lover in your life,<\/p>\n<p>- Awakening your orgasmic potential as a whole body ecstatic experience,<\/p>\n<p>- Why hot sex is not secular but sacred<\/p>\n<p>- How to move through the abuse of the sexual to sexual integrity,<\/p>\n<p>- How \u201cbeing a lover\u201d is a commitment to the act of generosity and transcending the self,<\/p>\n<p>- The art of surrender and why we will happily give up the illusion of control when we embrace the wisdom of eros,<\/p>\n<p>- The inner alchemy of hieros gamos \u2013 an inner marriage as a path towards wholeness<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>See you soon, until then...<\/p>\n<p>LOVE THE MOMENT OPEN!<\/p>\n<p>www.IntegralEvolutionaryTantra.com<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/f\/2\/highres_446157842.jpeg","photo_id":446157842,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/f\/2\/600_446157842.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/f\/2\/thumb_446157842.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11973327,"name":"Tara","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/d\/d\/highres_253191165.jpeg","photo_id":253191165,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/d\/d\/member_253191165.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/7\/d\/d\/thumb_253191165.jpeg"}},"members":170,"name":"Integral Evolutionary Tantra NYC","id":18575690,"state":"NY","urlname":"integral-evolutionary-tantra-NYC","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Outrageous Lovers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Summit","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430756038000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"inner-peace","name":"Inner peace","id":15822},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"forgiveness","name":"Forgiveness","id":23983},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"love-and-forgiveness-as-a-habit","name":"Love and Forgiveness As a Habit","id":88046},{"urlkey":"healing-through-love-and-forgiveness","name":"Healing through Love and Forgiveness","id":88047},{"urlkey":"the-power-of-forgiveness","name":"The Power of Forgiveness","id":159997},{"urlkey":"practicing-self-love","name":"Practicing Self Love","id":1235022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Clinton-Forgiveness-Meetup-Wellness-Rocks\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>2 hour educational, hands-on, interactive workshop on forgiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Have a grudge that just won't die?

Do you have a sincere interest in the Japanese language beyond just anime and J-pop?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, this may be the group for you.\n\nWe're a group of Japanese language enthusiasts who are looking to create an environment that will afford us the tools, resources, and opportunities to take our Japanese to the level of true fluency and we hope to find like-minded individuals to contribute to our study sessions.\n\nNew York City is a great place for learning languages because it's so easy to find people from all across the world who speak many languages, but despite this fact, opportunities to study the Japanese language are often aimed at low-level learners. We want to change this by creating a group with high ideals and dedication to focused study through various activities and events related to Japanese language.\n\nThis group is currently a work in progress--or perhaps more of an experiment, and we are looking for members that can help us grow into something truly great.

Anything Viking goes here so if your interested in Norse Mythology or just want to hang out drink party and fight like the Vikings did in their time you came to the right place!!! <br> The Long Island Vikings reenactment organization was formed to share knowledge of these amazing explorers and to fairly represent the peoples we collectively refer to as Vikings. We cultivate all the skills needed to survive in the Viking era and we share what we have learned freely with anyone interested. Our goal is to educate ourselves and others about the challenges these explorers and settlers faced and about the historical realities of life in the Viking age. <br> <br> We are guided first by archeology, keeping our representation close to the recorded physical culture left behind in Viking era settlements. We have rules concerning the fabrics and dyes used in our reenactor clothing and the use of metals, bone, leather and fur. We disallow modern items that would \"break the spell.\" Our aim is to provide an accurate and educational portrayal of the Viking period, with an emphasis on the daily life of the period. And now and again, we have a little fun reenacting the more warlike aspects of life in what was a formative period in European history. <br> <br> There are many ways to participate. Some simply enjoy studying the Vikings and participating in informed discussion. Others are experimental archeologists with their own \"need to know\"--a passion to learn about textiles, paint, weaving, woodworking, blacksmithing and even iron smelting. Many enjoy living in a Viking period encampment, experiencing firsthand the challenges of daily life in a former age (even if only for the weekend). And some are looking for the warrior life, recreating Viking combat and reliving great battles. If you want to get involved, join us on Facebook. <br> <br> Many of our members are available for school visits (in character) and our groups can add education and thrills to your local festivals. Contact us to find out who is available in your area. We were all once fifth graders, too. The difference is that now we know what Leif left behind--spindle whorls, ship rivets, ring pins--and we can probably pull one out of our bag to show you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>check us out on Facebook&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>join our Facebook group &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/?ref=bookmarks\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/longislandvikings\/?ref=bookmarks<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>","lon":-73.5800018311,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/highres_447766734.jpeg","photo_id":447766734,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/600_447766734.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/8\/e\/thumb_447766734.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":92411542,"name":"BATMAN","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/highres_254713108.jpeg","photo_id":254713108,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/member_254713108.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/3\/4\/thumb_254713108.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"Long Island Vikings","id":18583654,"state":"NY","urlname":"LIVIKINGS","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"VIKINGS"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Astoria","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431103110000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sportsfans","name":"Sports Fan","id":83},{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"astoria","name":"Astoria","id":78158},{"urlkey":"queens","name":"Queens","id":85799},{"urlkey":"long-island-city","name":"Long Island City","id":85800},{"urlkey":"forest-hills","name":"Forest Hills","id":759312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ny-queens\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p>Join the group and you'll have the opportunity to meet new friends as you explore different spots throughout Queens.

I fell in love with the dynamic pace and colorful nature of both the Digital World and New York City, and never looked back since. Presently, I run my own Online Business at home as an affiliate marketer, marketing online education products in the Business Opportunity Niche. This has allowed me to spend time with my children while generating the income that I require, at my own schedule and my own terms. To keep myself up-to-date with Digital Marketing, I work as the Search Director - Digital Marketing for an Executive Search Company in Asia on a project bases, providing search services for Digital Marketing professionals in the Corporate World.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>DAN BROWN<\/b>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Dan. You have been online for a while, then chances are you already know who I am, or at the very least you have heard of me. I run one of the largest and most profitable Digital Marketing agencies in the world. Digital Marketing Hive was born out of that experience and went from making zero dollars a month to making me a full-time living in a little over two years. And I did this working only four hours a day. Today I live a great lifestyle by spending my summers in Montreal, Canada, Spring in New York City, USA and the rest of the time traveling. This assures me an average year-round temperature of 75F. Being able to work from anywhere in the world is one of the greatest benefits the Internet can provide for you.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>_______________<\/p> \n<p>Please join our group and meet us for social gatherings to share online marketing ideas, business opportunities, traffic generation techniques, or simply just to mastermind and socialize.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><i>\"To associate with other like-minded people in small purposeful groups is for the great majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction\"<\/i> ~ Aldos Huxley<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/highres_439170983.jpeg","photo_id":439170983,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/600_439170983.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/0\/7\/thumb_439170983.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183873918,"name":"Meidee Lim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/highres_243221504.jpeg","photo_id":243221504,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/member_243221504.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/2\/0\/thumb_243221504.jpeg"}},"members":244,"name":"New York Online Business & Entrepreneurs Meetup","id":18583893,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Online-Business-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Online Marketers & Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431115527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Webinars\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To thrive in today's economy, you need knowledge.

Organized by the Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains, the Danger Zone March will begin at 1:00 p.m. at Sagamore Park (at Windsor Road at Beatrice Street), and conclude with a 2:30 p.m. rally in Teaneck\u2019s Votee Park (at Palisade Ave. and Court Street). &nbsp; The event will feature speakers from civic, environmental and religious groups and elected officials and live music. Up to 30 times a week, trains more than 100 tanker cars long haul hundreds of thousands of gallons of the volatile crude oil from Albany to Philadelphia refineries, crossing reservoirs and sensitive waterways including over the Oradell Reservoir (source of drinking water to 800,000 people in Bergen and Hudson Counties) and through 11 Bergen County towns. The oil trains then pass through densely populated Jersey City and Union; under major highways Routes 4 and 80 and I95; and next to Liberty National Airport. We'll focus attention on the catastrophic effects a derailment or other accident would incur, making stops at the Ambulance Corps, Benjamin Franklin Middle School, playgrounds and ball fields, a senior center, a day care center, and Teaneck\u2019s energy substation. The Chip Shelton Quartet will march with us in a New Orleans-style funeral march, to signify the imminent, mortal danger these unsafe trains place on people living in the blast area.&nbsp; People of all ages and abilities are welcome to join the family-friendly march. To assist people with limited mobility, The Bus for Progress, a non-profit organization that literally \u201cmobilizes\u201d citizens for just causes, will transport up to 40 people along the route. Hybrid and electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles are welcome to join the vehicle convoy.&nbsp; Because the US Department of Transportation\u2019s new rules for high-hazard flammable trains (issued on May 1, 2015) fall far short of significantly reducing the risk to track-side communities, Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains calls for an immediate stop to routing unsafe oil trains on a rail line through 11 Bergen County towns; transparency with the public on what hazardous materials the trains carry and when; and immediate investment in renewable energy. Paula Rogovin, founder of The Coalition to Ban Unsafe Oil Trains explains, \u201cThe new rules convince us that government has failed to protect the public. For example, the phaseout of the most dangerous cars, the DOT 111s,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not required to take place until 2017. Most of the oil trains we see on the River Line are DOT 111s. Inadequate breaking systems are not required to be replaced until 2021. In Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 47 people died, much of the downtown was destroyed, and water remains contaminated after the 2013 derailment of train cars carrying Bakken crude. In recent months trains with Bakken crude exploded like bombs in Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, and Ontario. Accidents don\u2019t wait to happen. Our lives are at risk right now. Transport of Bakken crude oil is unacceptable. Keep Bakken crude in the ground.\u201d \u201cSo far in New Jersey we have been very lucky. There are at least 50 oil trains a week passing through our state and many more coming each day. These trains are a disaster waiting to happen. There have been many derailments and there seems to be one every couple months. So far the derailments have happened in mostly rural areas. If one of those derailments happened here in New Jersey, which is the most densely populated state in the nation, there could be a catastrophic loss of life. Even though there are proposals to make these trains safe, they are unsafe at any speed. That\u2019s why Sierra Club is in federal Court to try to block these trains from being on our rail lines,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis oil is not only the most flammable, it\u2019s the most explosive, and no matter how you ship it there will be serious disasters. Many of these trains run through major water supply areas and a spill could wipe out the New Jersey water supply for months to come. One quart of oil contaminates one million gallons of water. One rail car carries 34,500 gallons of oil and could wipe out Bergen County\u2019s water supply. We are playing Russian roulette with these train cars and that\u2019s why they need to be banned. They should be banned&nbsp; now.\u201d Rosemary Dreger Carey, an organizer for 350NJ, says, \u201cTransporting highly volatile oil by any means--train, pipeline or barge--is inherently unsafe. And it is unnecessary because we have the technology and natural resources right here in New Jersey to switch to clean, safe renewable energy.\u201d The Danger Zone March is one of six grassroots events happening across New Jersey and New York to oppose risky and unnecessary area fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Pilgrim Pipeline and Port Ambrose LNG (liquid natural gas) facility.&nbsp;

The only way to transform violence is through practicing nonviolence. But what does it mean to practice nonviolence? It involves understanding the root causes of violence, both within ourselves and in others. It\u2019s also about cultivating an attention or mindfulness in ourselves and learning tools that we can use to change our behavior towards others and transform the situations of violence in which we find ourselves. The Community (for human development) are neighborhood-based groups of study, discussion, shared experience and social action. The Community is formed by people interested in the development of a new culture that rejects violence and places the human being as its central value.

A few days later he found himself in the military camp, T2, outside of Goma, where he met five boys being held prisoner by the national army. The boys had been child soldiers, taken from their homes and forced to fight for rebel groups, until one night they escaped and ran to the national army for refuge. Now they were being treated as enemies of the state.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>He spent the day with the boys, trading stories laughter and tears. One boy told him of children too small to carry guns being sent to the front-lines, armed with only a whistle. Sean wrote to a few friends of this single story of a single day, who then forwarded it around the world. Thousands of strangers wrote back asking: what can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fallingwhistles.com\">Falling Whistles<\/a> is a non-profit organization campaigning for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our goal is to create a sustainable peace and to help local entrepreneurs rebuild their war-torn community. We work with Congolese visionaries, leaders creating progress in business, education, health and culture to create sustainable jobs and a sustainable economy. We raise our voices to advocate for peace and to help end one of the deadliest wars of our time. The movement and coalition though builds upon the involvement and commitment of whistleblowers from all over the world, and this is where you come in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the start of the first NYC Whistler Society. We join a global network of local chapters dedicated to whistleblowing and together, we will start the conversation here in New York. We will develop innovative ways to get the attention of our community. We will support Congolese entrepreneurs through creating fundraising opportunities for their businesses and projects.

Gnosis is as ancient as life itself and is not bound by any one culture, religion, or people. Classically, the teachings of Gnosis were hidden from the public and guarded by an elite priesthood in every civilization, however, due to the age in which we live, these teaching have been made public for all to know. Join us to discover, learn, and practice this profound science in order to reach your own Self- Realization and Liberation. Our meetings include public lectures, discussions, and practices all facilitated towards the awakening of our Essence (our True Nature) and the elimination of our suffering.

We can fellowship with one another while we're there, and have more fun than any entertainer can provide. We can do short trips, long trips, far trips, or close trips. We can even do something as simple and inexpensive as going to a state park together.&nbsp; Cruises are always fun too. So, if this sounds like something you'd be interested in being a part of, by all means please join.<\/p>","lon":-73.7399978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11548188,"name":"Frank","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/highres_9197283.jpeg","photo_id":9197283,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/member_9197283.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/8\/3\/thumb_9197283.jpeg"}},"members":12,"name":"NY Christian Families Travel Group","id":18604456,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-Christian-Families-Travel-Group","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Christian Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431888724000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"childrens-groups","name":"Children's Groups","id":16897},{"urlkey":"art-classes","name":"Art Classes","id":18268},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"childrens-art-education","name":"Childrens Art Education","id":25970},{"urlkey":"families-with-young-children","name":"Families With Young Children","id":26156},{"urlkey":"arts-crafts-for-kids","name":"Arts & Crafts for Kids","id":26389},{"urlkey":"childrens-activities","name":"Children's Activities","id":29313},{"urlkey":"kids-art","name":"kids art","id":1198062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Eckford-Street-Studio-Family-Open-Studio\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Family Open Studio takes place most Sunday mornings from 9:30-11:30, with a different drawing, painting, sculpture or collage project prepared each session, interpreted for tots and school aged kids. parents will be joining their kids doing art activities!

I encourage women to use the dating period as a time of investigation and not just infatuation and suggest that choices be based on self-worth and value rather than on pure attraction and desire. I do not instruct women in getting and keeping a man. Rather I focus on men and examine some of the reasons many are not suitable for dating and marriage. To assist women in the evaluation process I have designed a rating system laid out in my dating guide called \"The Five Star Man\". This system reveals (5) major areas of stability and discusses each in full detail. This rating system has proven to be very effective by those who have used it. The primary goal of the meetings is to give women a new sense of direction, purpose, and self worth, while at the same time equipping them with the tools needed to identify the man who is truly deserving.<\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":63551342,"name":"trudy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/0\/b\/highres_256733259.jpeg","photo_id":256733259,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/0\/b\/member_256733259.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/0\/b\/thumb_256733259.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Dating Advice Meetup - For Women Only","id":18610580,"state":"NY","urlname":"Dating-Advice-Meetup","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Daters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432086024000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"abundance","name":"Abundance","id":15842},{"urlkey":"abundance-and-prosperity","name":"Abundance And Prosperity","id":15942},{"urlkey":"creating-abundance","name":"Creating Abundance","id":15948},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Prosperity-and-Abundance-Workshop-meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This meet up is for individuals who knows that they have what it takes but need help accessing their inner power.

Some men have been to retreats and others have joined weekly circles to find their brothers. The goal is simple - to reconnect with the lineage of real masculinity, one that includes all of the complex emotions that men experience and rarely share. In a sacred and confidential men's circle, we step into a world where men can say and hear things that we've longed to express. This honesty and vulnerability allows us to unearth buried emotions and begin to let them go quite naturally. This is vitally important work for ourselves and for our fellow men. Our planet and our children depend upon us to create a new awareness based upon these ancient traditions. What is a typical evening like? Every month, we will gather twice.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not sure this is for you? Try Session 1 ($25) and pay the balance at the second&nbsp;session if it works for your needs! Thanks to our brother, Jeff, for suggesting this great idea to open the door for more men!<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><span>The structure will be very simple: 7:00 - 8:00 pm Meditation and Gentle Kripalu Yoga 8:00 - 9:30 pm Open Circle. Who is this program for? Men of any age or background who have a willingness to unite their spiritual, physical and mental selves. Per the schedule, we will be doing some yoga and meditation. Don't worry if you are new to these practices. The atmosphere will be one where men of all abilities are welcome! Can I come for just part of the evening? No. Our goal is to have everyone take part in the entire process. If you have a physical condition that prohibits you from taking part in the yoga, please confer with the teacher who will offer you modifications so that you can participate.

The wines will be carefully chosen as good examples of their type and offer a good price-quality ratio. To facilitate dinner-table discussions and to ensure that everyone is able to taste and retaste all the wines, attendance will be capped at 10 men per dinner. To cover the cost of the wines, attendees will pay a fee when RSVPing.

While donors can easily, simply, and publicly support a wide range of charitable organizations, brands can align their philanthropic efforts with their customers. bitCharities can engage the first party brand's database and activate them to participate in charitable donations, creating global awareness and a call for action even before any money is spent.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":92933952,"name":"Elaha Mahboob","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/e\/d\/highres_246534509.jpeg","photo_id":246534509,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/e\/d\/member_246534509.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/e\/d\/thumb_246534509.jpeg"}},"members":221,"name":"Non-Profits Professionals Network","id":18630259,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nonprofits-Professionals-Network","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432773245000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"hacking","name":"Hacking","id":21123},{"urlkey":"startup-business","name":"startup business","id":56916},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"ui-design","name":"UI Design","id":107583},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"ux-ui","name":"UX\/UI","id":996032},{"urlkey":"hackathons","name":"hackathons","id":1022382}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/protohack-newyorkcity\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for the New York City Chapter of \"Non-Technical Entrepreneurs Meetup &amp; Networking.\" Hosted by ProtoHack, the code-free hackathon.

BPD is a stressful condition that causes great pain in the sufferer as well as the people who are closest to him\/her. Until recently, there's been a tendency for professionals to blame parents for their children's disorder, which further burdens family members. Parents need to find ways to maintain their equilibrium in order to help their struggling children. Partners and spouses of people with borderline personality often question whether they should stay in their relationships. Children whose parents have this disorder have complicated issues that carry over into adulthood.

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying.

Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task). The team has since continued in its commitment to the community by following its mission to foster the well-being of women from all backgrounds and all ages. We are proud to be a reflection of our home base, Queens, in our diversity and fortunate enough to be&nbsp;multi-generational, as we value&nbsp;experience as much as exuberance.

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game.

No writing experience is needed and sharing your writing with the group is entirely optional.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>This group has a heavy emphasis on spirituality, meditation, learning to live intuitively, and learning to get beyond the ego to connect with the place from where inspiration and creativity flows.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>It is not about manuscript critiquing or the business of publishing.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>About me: <\/b>I'm a a published author, an award nominated scriptwriter and journalist, with a career ranging from an Iraq War correspondent to lifestyle and spirituality feature writing. My work has been featured on BBC, NPR, McClatchy News and the Huffington Post.&nbsp;<span>I am also an evidential and healing medium and teacher. <\/span><span>I trained in mediumship the Arthur Findlay College in London and healing and intuitive modalities at the Edgar Cayce Center in VA &amp; NY.&nbsp;As a Master in Anglo-Irish literature and graduate of the London School of Journalism, I am an exponent of writing for mindfulness and spiritual transformation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I combine my writing ability with mediumship to access the wisdom of the spirit to create work that is healing for me and for many around me.

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to. I know how hard and lonely the journey can be, and wanted to create a group where anyone and everyone who might be going through their own ordeal can turn to for support. <\/p>\n<p>My hope is that we can become a family that grows together, and ultimately have an impact on each other\u2019s journeys.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186351000,"name":"Alan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/highres_254793575.jpeg","photo_id":254793575,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/member_254793575.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/3\/2\/7\/thumb_254793575.jpeg"}},"members":67,"name":"Headaches, dizziness, anxiety and this thing I cant explain","id":18656568,"state":"NY","urlname":"thisthingicantexplain","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wanaque","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433737416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pagan","name":"Pagan","id":486},{"urlkey":"asatru","name":"Asatru","id":770},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"goddess","name":"Goddess","id":1052},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"drumcircle","name":"Drum Circle","id":2278},{"urlkey":"wiccan","name":"Wiccan","id":3862},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"heathen","name":"Heathen","id":15102},{"urlkey":"pagan-social","name":"Pagan Social","id":32452},{"urlkey":"earth-based-spirituality","name":"Earth-Based Spirituality","id":37479},{"urlkey":"everything-witchcraft","name":"Witchcraft","id":74176},{"urlkey":"norse-paganism","name":"Norse Paganism","id":89546},{"urlkey":"heathenry-or-heathenism-or-heathens","name":"Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens","id":102841},{"urlkey":"summer-solstice","name":"Summer Solstice","id":107023}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Pagans\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>New Jersey Pagans is the Largest Online and Offline Community in NJ We have been serving the community for over 15 yrs.

We are a running group supporting runners who are dealing with an injury or coming back to running after an injury.<\/p>\n<p> I know you don't want to be here... who would want to be injured instead of being out there running? Nobody! Unfortunately, the majority of the runners get injured at some point in their running career. I've got injured right after I started running 7 years ago. My Achilles tendon gave up on me. I was in a walking boot for&nbsp;several months followed by countless hours of PT sessions. It was painful, it was boring, and I felt shunned. I could not RUN!&nbsp;But in a way I was lucky. I met a girl who was a runner and&nbsp;injured as well. She had a stress fracture and she couldn't RUN either. We started to hang out and talk about our injuries, walk in Central Park instead of run,&nbsp;we discussed treatment options, our progress&nbsp;and plans after recovery. This was such a powerful bond between us: we are still best friends since and we are both recovered and running happy these days.<\/p>\n<p>You might want to find a similar place, or a friend who you can talk to about your injury and running and what the future holds for you. This is why this Meetup group was created. We welcome you here and we don't judge you. We understand that you are frustrated because of your injury and inability to do what you love the most: <strong>RUN<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to meet weekly and support each other. We can have discussions in a caf\u00e9 or we can have a slow stroll in the park. Whatever works! Come out, let's support each other in the recovery process, and before you know it, you will be back again&nbsp;in the park running!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founder of BIBSWITCH<\/p>\n<p><strong>BIBSWITCH<\/strong> - is an online platform that facilitates race number transfers between race organizers and runners who can no longer participate in an event they signed up for&nbsp;in advance.

Outside of yoga, I have a full time job that I love and a supportive group of love ones. On most days, I am happy, but just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to manage. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share the practice with you. Teaching and practicing yoga are my hobbies so some weeks, I might not have any class if other priorities take over. When that happens, I usually find a guest instructor to lead the class, or not schedule one. Don't let that stop you from your personal practice. Let this group compliments whatever practice you already have (or help you start one if you are new to yoga). Reserve your sport today and try it out!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/b\/f\/highres_449144223.jpeg","photo_id":449144223,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/b\/f\/600_449144223.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/b\/f\/thumb_449144223.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9323786,"name":"Linh Lanh","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/highres_247003866.jpeg","photo_id":247003866,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/member_247003866.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/thumb_247003866.jpeg"}},"members":190,"name":"Lavender Space Yoga Afterwork","id":18659774,"state":"NY","urlname":"LavenderSpace","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Yoga practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bloomfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433836882000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"young-business-professionals","name":"Young Business Professionals","id":15530},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"networking-happy-hour","name":"Networking Happy Hour","id":46030},{"urlkey":"young-professional-women","name":"Young Professional Women","id":52083},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"young-professional-networking","name":"Young Professional Networking","id":79058}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Young-Professionals-Meet-and-Mingle\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for young professionals interested in networking in a local, fun environment.

It is not simply acquiring business cards and adding names to your \u201cLinkedIn\u201d account \u2013 it is taking the time to getting to know people in the areas in which you are interested or want to learn more about and staying in touch with them throughout your career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. Initiate the creation of series of events focused on professional development through speaker series, hands-on skill development workshops, and mentorship opportunities to help overcome the specific challenges faced by women.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Create a platform to practice the soft skills in a conversational and friendly setting. Most of us know our weaknesses, whether we need to be more organized or do a better job of meeting deadlines or simply prioritizing in a smarter way.

Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself. But what if that mirror has been neglected for hundreds of years? There are layers and layers of debris, dust, dirt and filth. And when you look into that mirror, all you see is the dust and the dirt that is accumulated, and all that you think is \u201cThis is me!\u201d But when you clean the mirror, little by little you start seeing the image of yourself. And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are. Meditation is for that purpose; prayers are for that purpose; spirituality is for that purpose: to cleanse our heart, to cleanse our life-style so that we can actually directly experience our own essence, which is eternal, full of knowledge and full of love<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/highres_438500682.jpeg","photo_id":438500682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/600_438500682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/thumb_438500682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":91531402,"name":"Dhyana","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/highres_246924137.jpeg","photo_id":246924137,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/member_246924137.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/thumb_246924137.jpeg"}},"members":350,"name":"Meditation & Kirtan: For New and Experienced - LES\/E.Village","id":18662790,"state":"NY","urlname":"meditation-group-LES","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Meditaters, Yogis, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433942491000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"advertising","name":"Advertising","id":690},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"digital-media","name":"Digital Media","id":17188},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"social-media-for-business","name":"Social Media for Business","id":37708},{"urlkey":"learn-social-media-marketing","name":"Learn Social Media Marketing","id":80837},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-analytics","name":"Digital Marketing Analytics","id":785142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Snapchat-Marketing-in-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"A place to come together and talk about Snapchat\u2122 marketing.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans!

We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!!

(P.S. if you are beginning to suffer GOT withdrawal symptoms, a great emergency survival technique is to read the Tales of Dunk and Egg: start with The Hedge Knight).","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/highres_440061622.jpeg","photo_id":440061622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/600_440061622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/thumb_440061622.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6017769,"name":"Silver Moon Services","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/9\/f\/9\/highres_247094841.jpeg","photo_id":247094841,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/9\/f\/9\/member_247094841.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/9\/f\/9\/thumb_247094841.jpeg"}},"members":345,"name":"New York Game of Thrones Meetup","id":18673544,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Game-of-Thrones-Meetup","category":{"name":"sci-fi\/fantasy","id":29,"shortname":"sci-fi-fantasy"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434380233000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-having-fun","name":"Girls having fun","id":15413},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Asian-Sisters-Social-Club-for-late-20s-30s\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Join this group if you want to make everlasting friendships with smart, beautiful (inside and out) women who you can count on like sisters, and grow your social and professional network.

Cosmism is the best philosophical framework in which to conceptualize this journey.<\/p> \n<p>The ancient Greeks believed that Cosmos (as universal order) are ruled by the Logos, which is the principle of reason, world-law and measure.

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

Say for example; its pouring rain on a set in Brooklyn and you ask to go inside to holding. When the P.A. says no then you need to hang out and wait, as it rains. BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

When we were evolved from Amoeba to humans, we were not aware of it. In order to evolve from human beings to pure joy and pure spirits, the all-pervading power wants us to realize the transformation. The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1.

This group is oriented to those in their 20s, 30s and 40s (and a few beyond that if they can keep up).<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>We'll also sometimes go to cultural events and to hear live music. You may additionally find us on various types of boats. And whether it's on a hotel rooftop or in a lovely park, when good weather beckons us outside, we can't resist.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>If somehow you got the impression that this is not a \"party\" meetup, think again. This is essentially a party meetup. Non-drinkers are welcome, but as a group we will often be drinking. Drinking, talking, having great conversations.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>I said that this was essentially a party meetup, but that's not quite correct. We are essentially a group of very kind, thoughtful, down-to-earth and well-intentioned people, who are on the intellectual side and love to talk about ideas of all kinds. And love to have scintillating and delightful nights on the town while doing so. Is this you? Then you've found your home.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>This is intended as a small meetup group, and we are planning to have relatively small events. We'll be starting with events for 10-12 people, and perhaps later allowing as many as 20 people at certain events. Most of all we are looking for a quality experience for everyone, not to have a large party with random strangers.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events. We will always post on the Meetup when this is the case.<\/p>\n<p>Questions?

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

Whether you're heterosexual, LGBTQ, married, single, have children or not, you are all welcomed and encouraged to join. The minimal membership fee is only to discourage nosey people from gawking at the list of members and any scheduled activities. It will only ever be used for this Meetup group's monthly fee and\/or toward anything else pertaining to this group. (Proof of this will ALWAYS be provided upon request).<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to doing all kinds of fabulous activities with all of you!<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/f\/b\/highres_439589435.jpeg","photo_id":439589435,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/f\/b\/600_439589435.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/f\/b\/thumb_439589435.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":21927141,"name":"Monique","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/highres_244177862.jpeg","photo_id":244177862,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/member_244177862.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/thumb_244177862.jpeg"}},"members":56,"name":"HIV+ People (ANY adults w\/ or w\/o kids) POSITIVELY Living!","id":18719800,"state":"NY","urlname":"HIV-People-POSITIVELY-Living","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Positively Living Person (PLP)"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1436097558000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"wine-and-food-pairing","name":"Wine and Food Pairing","id":15635},{"urlkey":"baking","name":"Baking","id":15718},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"healthy-cooking","name":"Healthy Cooking","id":20993},{"urlkey":"vegetarian-cooking","name":"Vegetarian cooking","id":21512},{"urlkey":"cooking-dinner-parties","name":"Cooking Dinner Parties","id":21684},{"urlkey":"gourmet-cooking","name":"Gourmet Cooking","id":24614},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"home-cooking","name":"Home Cooking","id":32289},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Stamford-Cooking-Classes-with-Chef-Stef\/","rating":4.95,"description":"Chef Stef has been teaching cooking classes in the Hudson Valley for over two years, and now he is coming to lower Fairfield County.\n\nJoin Chef Stef, graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, as he teaches you to cook seasonal foods and dishes.

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

As corporate America becomes more inclusive and further diversifies its supply chain, certification offers the opportunity for LGBT-owned businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors.<\/p>","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":68500742,"name":"Joe Renga","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/highres_248123136.jpeg","photo_id":248123136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/member_248123136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/6\/0\/thumb_248123136.jpeg"}},"members":382,"name":"New Jersey LGBT Chamber of Commerce","id":18757966,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-LGBT-Chamber-of-Commerce","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437503918000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"book-writing","name":"Book writing","id":608402}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LES-Writers-Salon\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Fiction writers, playwrights, and poets who want to get critiqued , get published, and make friends.<\/p> \n<p>No memoir writers please<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":138438392,"name":"Ana Wieder Blank","photo":{"photo_id":185431662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/member_185431662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/a\/e\/thumb_185431662.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"LES  Writers Salon","id":18758170,"state":"NY","urlname":"LES-Writers-Salon","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437508595000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"exchangestud","name":"International and Exchange Students","id":3451},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/interEDGE\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.interEDGE.org\">interEDGE.org<\/a> provides monthly group coaching to international students in Greater New York City.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>The group will be limited to a small group at a time to ensure the quality of the conversation and guaranteed support to each member.<\/p>\n<p>*&nbsp;Who should join:&nbsp;All international students.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered. Besides being a full-time mama, I am a facilitator and organizer of sacred ceremony as well as a shamanic practitioner, Reiki master, yoga teacher and BodyTalk practitioner.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/highres_440357671.jpeg","photo_id":440357671,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/600_440357671.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/thumb_440357671.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":620,"name":"AYAM Healing with Plants","id":18780380,"state":"NY","urlname":"AYAMHealingwithPlants","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438121636000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"cities","name":"Cities","id":69931},{"urlkey":"smart-city","name":"Smart City","id":72764},{"urlkey":"sustainable-cities","name":"Sustainable Cities","id":146918},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Join us if you are passionate about cities, think that public spending should be more open to new solutions and that cities should be amazing problem-solvers.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":128652852,"name":"Sascha Haselmayer","photo":{"photo_id":170891702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/member_170891702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/thumb_170891702.jpeg"}},"members":55,"name":"Procurement 2.2 - Transform the way cities solve problems","id":18780723,"state":"NY","urlname":"Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438134813000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blues","name":"Blues","id":135},{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"tea","name":"Tea","id":230},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"ballet-and-modern-dance-on-stage","name":"Ballet and Modern Dance on Stage","id":22494},{"urlkey":"black-womens-issues","name":"Black Womens Issues","id":34443},{"urlkey":"fun-for-friends-and-their-friends","name":"Fun for Friends and Their Friends","id":44531},{"urlkey":"bargain-shopping","name":"Bargain Shopping","id":695852},{"urlkey":"meeting-old-friends-and-making-new-friends","name":"Meeting old friends and making new friends","id":1187892}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/meetup-group-sPxvyFeJ\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/f\/1\/600_440308913.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><i>If you're on Meet-Up you might have encountered a common theme many face today. It can be a bit more difficult meeting new like minded people to; try new things, exchange ideas and enjoy activities as single adults. \"Living Single\" was one of my favorite tv shows of the 90's! (If you missed out, check it out on youtube) The show was about a group of girlfriends making it through single life. I created this New Jersey group for women ( mid 20's to mid 30's) to cultivate a similar experience. So, if you're looking to meet new girlfriends, try out-of-the-box events and enjoy positive experiences around the tri-state, get from behind the T.V., iPad, iPhone and and come check us out!<\/i><\/p>","lon":-74.2699966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/highres_440309080.jpeg","photo_id":440309080,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/600_440309080.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/8\/thumb_440309080.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10686067,"name":"Danielle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/highres_248325773.jpeg","photo_id":248325773,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/member_248325773.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/2\/c\/d\/thumb_248325773.jpeg"}},"members":37,"name":"Living Single","id":18781269,"state":"NJ","urlname":"meetup-group-sPxvyFeJ","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Folks"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438137278000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"kayaking","name":"Kayaking","id":590},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"skiing","name":"Skiing","id":2294},{"urlkey":"snowboard","name":"Snowboarding","id":3425},{"urlkey":"ccskiing","name":"Cross-Country Skiing","id":3490},{"urlkey":"snowshoeing","name":"Snowshoeing","id":6696},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"snowsports","name":"Snowsports","id":28845},{"urlkey":"winter-sports","name":"Winter Sports","id":34378},{"urlkey":"downhill-skiing","name":"Downhill Skiing","id":37246},{"urlkey":"cross-country-skiing","name":"Cross Country Skiing","id":52821},{"urlkey":"snow-activities","name":"SNOW ACTIVITIES","id":133504}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pinnacle-Ski-Sports-Club\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>Skiers, snowboarders, showshoers, hikers, bikers, adventurers, winter sports enthusiasts.<\/p>","lon":-73.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/highres_441360711.jpeg","photo_id":441360711,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/600_441360711.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/7\/thumb_441360711.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190577679,"name":"Pinnacle Ski & Sports Club"},"members":227,"name":"Pinnacle Ski & Sports Club","id":18781361,"state":"CT","urlname":"Pinnacle-Ski-Sports-Club","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Caldwell","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438181511000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"camping","name":"Camping","id":374},{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"fishing","name":"Fishing","id":1255},{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"mountain-biking","name":"Mountain Biking","id":20266},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"northern-new-jersey","name":"Northern New Jersey","id":35537},{"urlkey":"local-activities","name":"Local Activities","id":64867},{"urlkey":"nature","name":"Nature","id":197471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/westessex\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>As a child, I spent much of my life outdoors. &nbsp;Whether in a backyard or campground, many of my fondest memories have something to do with being outside. &nbsp;Now with a family of my own, I cant help but notice how much time our digital devices consume us on a daily basis. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I'm a self proclaimed tech junkie. &nbsp;Like many of you, my cell phone is attached to my hip, whether for professional or personal reasons.<\/p>\n<p>I created this Meetup to encourage people to reconnect with the great outdoors.
