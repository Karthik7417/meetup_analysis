Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/225807117\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytnbpb","time":1444568400000,"updated":1444580777000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":6,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440023902000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a <b>Metro North Day Excursion on the Evening Star from Peekskill NY.

Frequently, however, this openness masks a reluctance to explore the very traditions out of which we ourselves have emerged. In this series Rev. Robb will take a fresh look at the spiritual insightfulness and moral imagination contained in the teaching of Jesus while emphasizing how they may continue to be revelatory in our current context. It is always surprising to look carefully at the actual words of great teachers with whom we have assumed we were fairly familiar and to discover new ways of understanding and fresh insights of which we were unaware. In this series we will examine in depth some of the stories Jesus told\u2014the parables\u2014which were probably the most characteristic and innovative way he had to convey his own spiritual vision.<\/p> <p><b><br\/>\u00a0Rev.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

This can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting selected and rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian channels\/chakras, or the subtle pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is guided to sensations in the body that can be grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into active strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

It included Salad, Cauliflower, Soup, Rice, Roti, 5 Hot dishes, Masala Chai Tea, Dessert, soda, beer, and\/or sangria. Everything looked fresh, smelled great, and tasted delicious. I had a beer-mosa. \u00a0They give you Roti, a large water bottle, and a Tandoori chicken leg to start. The Pakoras were deep fried in chick pea battered. \u00a0These little vegetable fritters were absolutely wonderful. \u00a0The rice was soft. I stole all of the peas and carrots. \u00a0Here are my guesses on what I think I ate:<\/p> <p>-Aloo Gobi contained soft potatoes and lentils stew.<\/p> <p>-Peeli Daal contained yellow lentils flavored with<\/p> <p>\u00a0garlic and herbs.<\/p> <p>-Tofu Jalfrezi \u00a0contained spiced tomato curry with stir-fried onions, bell peppers and tomatoes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>-Chicken Goan contained a mix of green chilies, coconut, coriander and vinegar.<\/p> <p>-Tikka Masala or Chicken Tandoori had a very thick tomato cream sauce<\/p> <p>Everything was quite good. \u00a0The Chicken Goan came on the bone which made it hard to eat. \u00a0The Chicken Tikka was cut into large chunks, tender, and plentiful. \u00a0I basically had three plates of this chicken with Rice and Flatbeard.<\/p> <p>For Dessert they had Gulab Jamun which is a lightly fried Milk Protein Dough and topped with simple syurp. \u00a0The texture was weird but enjoyable,<\/p> <p>The service was not bad but not spectacular because its a lunch buffet.<\/p> <p>Next Time: the Spicy: Man v Food Phaal challenge\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/jYkfbkbctz4G9E5-45PeqA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/7ci7eIXnmeeAOq2t_3NmXA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/LJ6krhN-tzkEv8CE17yZyQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/4Hz8R-0PiGjVNPF89OIWfg\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Ethnic-Food-Lovers\/events\/225499985\/","yes_rsvp_count":36,"name":"Sunday Brunch: Indian Buffet at Brick Lane (New Venue)","id":"225499985","time":1444579200000,"updated":1444770162000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1249514440000,"name":"!

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/225785360\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Sexy Halloween Shoot w\/Neesy & Stephanie - Oct. 11th","id":"225785360","time":1444579200000,"updated":1444599020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10002","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"152 Ludlow Street","address_2":"Btwn: Stanton & Rivington street","lon":-73.987898,"phone":"212-253-0036","name":"Cake Shop","id":839549,"state":"NY","lat":40.720953,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.01417946815,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428893599000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Work on your own projects and if you have questions feel free to ask them.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225739481\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytnbpb","time":1444579200000,"updated":1444591772000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":19.3977603912,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443644321000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Abraham-Hicks workshop that was canceled for Saturday, October 3rd has been rescheduled for Sunday, October 11th; 12pm - 4pm.<\/p> <p>Let Abraham awaken the clarity that is already within you - in person.

For those of us in relationships, it is easy to feel disconnected from our partners.<\/p> <p><br\/>So\u2014this got me thinking: how can WE be the model and infuse consciousness into dating\u00a0 in the city?

Let's just say we're stepping into the no-ghosting zone.<\/p> <p><br\/>Join us on Sunday, October 11th from 1-3 where we\u2019ll be chatting about dating mindfully and conscious partnerships. \u00a0Because we all know, NYC needs a shot of authenticity and grounding when it comes to the dating and relationship rodeo.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be exploring:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 What does dating mindfully look like?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00b7\u00a0 What is a conscious relationship? What are the mindsets of people in conscious relationships?<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00b7\u00a0 Am I projecting my needs and desires onto my potential or current partner? How can I give what I need to myself instead of relying on someone else to fulfill it?<\/p> <p>And\u2026new! For this tea, we\u2019ll be exploring it at a new location: my cozy and comfortable apartment in Williamsburg, with delicious teas and food from women-owned, NY-based businesses. Our afternoon includes:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Delicious tea from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.serendipitea.com\/\">Serendipitea<\/a>, a woman\u2019s owned NY-based company.

See you then.<\/p> <p>Xo<\/p> <p>Carla<\/p> <p>One important note: the point of this discussion is to talk about conscious dating and relationships.

Their lively and triumphant performance will take place at the historic Emmanuel Baptist Church, located at 279 Lafayette Avenue, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, from 3pm-5pm. NCJQ is a collaboration made to endure and make a long-lasting impression on its audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Drummer Ulysses Owens and pianist Takeshi Obayashi are co-leaders, yet each of the band members contributes equally as writers and arrangers to the group's soulful rhythms. They lead with the belief that the music is strongest when the range of talents among the group is fulfilled. Bassist Yasushi Nakamura elevates the rhythm section with vivid intensity, whether he is swinging hard or using the bow to evoke an intimate mood. Alto player Tim Green brings supple warmth that conjures up the sounds of Kenny Garrett, Charlie Parker, and Wayne Shorter. Trumpeter Benny Benack III (who, alongside Owens, Wynton Marsalis has named on his list of \u201cinnovators in the new generation of jazz\u201d) asserts a bright tone and witty exuberance throughout, providing a perfect compliment to Green's lyricism.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Back of sanctuary- Ask greeters at door for meetup group area","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Jazz\/events\/225948096\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"New Century Jazz Quintet","id":"225948096","time":1444590000000,"updated":1444601637000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1258483680000,"name":"Brooklyn Jazz\/Experimental Live Music","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1558294,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Jazz","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10708","country":"us","city":"Bronxville","phone":"914-482-0696","address_1":"2 Allen Place","name":"Sally's Place","lon":-73.80717,"id":290255,"state":"NY","lat":40.930515,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.7449007034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1308279886000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Single parents are invited to join Parents Without Partners Chapter #21 .

You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance.

There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

It includes suburban towns such as Montclair, West Orange, Verona, Bloomfield, Nutley, and Belleville, and ends in urban Newark.<\/p> <p>This is the fifth annual LENAPE34 which is a very challenging yet very popular annual event for the FreeWalkers. The walker is faced with about 50% wooded trail and 50% suburban and urban sidewalks and streets. Shorter daylight hours add to the physical and mental challenge.<\/p> <p>There are alternatives for shorter segments. So you may choose to do less but can still walk along with the group. We'll also have the support of two train lines for mass transportation both to and from several points along the way. Since its on a Monday, we'll have the benefit of working with a full weekday schedule for this particular walk - allowing more frequent trains for your convenience. There are also several buses running in the area.<\/p> <p>As always, the walk is free and everyone is invited. Most of this trail is a major segment of the Liberty Water Gap Trail, the 130-mile east-to-west trail across the entire state of New Jersey. Its name \"Lenape\" suggests honoring the Native American ancestors of our area on a day where we also honor the discovery of America. So, we're tagging this event the \"Origins Walk\".<\/p> <p>This is an effort to support the revitalization of the Lenape Trail and the Liberty Water Gap Trail concept as well as help support a unique natural-to-urban trail and pedestrian environment which should be seen and experience by more citizens.<\/p> <p>NOTE: We will use be using the old southern segment in South Mountain Reservation - not the western continuation (East Hanover) of the Liberty Water Gap Trail.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/lenape34.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lenape34.org<\/a> for more information.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FreeWalkers\/events\/225248934\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":48600000,"name":"Lenape 34 - The Origins Walk 2015","id":"225248934","time":1444647600000,"updated":1444697860000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330909842000,"name":"FreeWalkers","group_lon":-74.4899978638,"id":3415342,"urlname":"FreeWalkers","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"FreeWalkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":" Terrace Dr. New York, NY 10024","name":"72nd by Bethesda Fountain","lon":-73.971802,"id":14222132,"state":"NY","lat":40.773842,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.90655148029,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1407178330000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"Overlooking Bethesda Fountain","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dashing-whippets\/events\/225868428\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Central Park Morning Run","id":"qtnrgkytnbqb","time":1444647600000,"updated":1444659246000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242098830000,"name":"Dashing Whippets Running Team","group_lon":-74,"id":1454408,"urlname":"dashing-whippets","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dashing Whippets"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.32723164558,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439927377000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every week we will have a different prompt for our weekly photo project.\u00a0 This week\u2019s theme is My Neighbors.<\/p> <p>Each week beginning early Monday morning, you can begin uploading your photos to our meetup album for the week\u2019s theme.\u00a0 The group won\u2019t actually meet for this event, it\u2019s an individual online challenge for each of you to get your creative juices flowing, share photos in the group, comment and critique each other\u2019s shots, and above all have fun.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Albums will remain open, so you can upload photos any time after that Monday morning start time but you\u2019ll get the most feedback during the initial week the theme is posted.\u00a0 You also don\u2019t have to restrict yourself to photos taken during that week for the theme, they can be from past shoots you have done or the weekly prompt can be used to motivate you to shoot something new.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Eric-Leuthardt-Photography-Club-NYC\/events\/224722792\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Weekly Photo Project - My Neighbors","id":"224722792","time":1444647600000,"updated":1444659243000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401652358000,"name":"Eric Leuthardt Photography Club - NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":14810112,"urlname":"Eric-Leuthardt-Photography-Club-NYC","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"685 Third Avenue","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.973328,"id":23833317,"state":"NY","lat":40.751579,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.881249666214,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432179007000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>-NEW MEMBER WELCOME-<\/p> <p>\uff08\u203bThis event is for those who want to study Japanese and who want to teach Japanese. \u00a0NOT for Japanese who want to study English\uff09<\/p> <p>Come seize the day with us over a cup of coffee, a danish, and Japanese conversation at our early morning events!<\/p> <p>These casual gatherings are open for all levels of Japanese.

I recommend taking the Appalachian Trail up the mountain the first time and using the Major Welch to return. Head for the outdoor ice skating rink. As you walk from the rink to Hessian Lake, a paved trail leads up a hill. This was the access road to the old ski jump which has not been used for MANY years. Follow the white blazes of the Appalachian Trail as it winds its way up the mountain. In some spots there are some bare rock faces to climb up at angles over 40 degrees.

You want to update some packages to their most recent versions possible, but you want your software to run after the upgrades, thus perhaps entailing changes to the versions of other packages. One approach is trial and error, but that quickly ends in frustration. We advocate a reproducibility-based approach in which tools like ptrace, reprozip, pip, and virtual machines combine to enable us to explore version combinations of different packages even on a variety of platforms. Because the space of versions to explore grows exponentially with the number of packages, we have developed a memoizing algorithm that avoids exponential search while guaranteeing an optimum version combination. This is joint work with Christophe Pradal, Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, and Patrick Valduriez.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Dennis Shasha is a professor of computer science at the Courant Institute of New York University and an Associate Director of NYU Wireless. He works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial people on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, resampling statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American, Dr. Dobb's Journal, and the Communications of the ACM. He is a fellow of the ACM and an INRIA International Chair.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/att-nyc-seminars\/events\/225421372\/","yes_rsvp_count":45,"name":"Dennis Shasha, NYU","id":"225421372","time":1444660200000,"updated":1444673971000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442419133000,"name":"AT&T NYC Research Seminar Series","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18937940,"urlname":"att-nyc-seminars","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Nyack","address_1":"78 Main Street (above Turiellos pizza shop)","name":"Soul Flyte","lon":0,"id":23221612,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":23.7479934692,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443647913000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi!

That is a complete sentence. Is she a role model? Probably not. Is she completely human and relatable? Absolutely. Frida Kahlo is an enigmatic art figure whom countless historians have tried to assess albeit not that well. Sometimes you can't label or fit someone smugly and snuggly into a specific convention. Sometimes you have to let grace take over and let the person and art suffice. We know this because we respond so intimately to her body of work - most of which is her. Unlike Pablo Picasso, we can't separate the body of work from the person. A horrific accident that brought about a life lived with disability and many subsequent health problems did not prevent her from engaging with life to the fullest. Her choices were hers to make, to hold close and to live free from judgment.<\/p> <p>The New York Botanical Garden is saluting and promoting the art of Frida Kahlo. We are fortunate to live in a city that can bring her life and home to fruition. NYBG is not only exhibiting her art, they've also recreated her personal garden of her home, Casa Azul, in a style of tribute within the main Conservatory - A World of Plants.<\/p> <p><b>Our Plan:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We are bringing our own lunch to eat at the Picnic Pavilion.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>11:15am -\u00a0<\/b>We meet at the information booth at the center of the main hall at Grand Central Terminal.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.

You\u2019ve got robots, and you\u2019ve got biology. Seldom in the natural world do you find solutions to the problems of grasping, manipulating, and moving like the ones we\u2019ve come up with. Instead you find complex integrated systems that distribute load and provide power in a thousand brilliant ways.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This talk introduces some biological systems (like the beak of a squid which allows a creature basically made of protein-rich jelly to bite the heads off things orders of magnitude harder than it on the durometer scale), describes the engineering behind them, and discusses methods newly minted through digital fabrication and 3d printing for duplicating them.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>In\u00a0Matthew\u2019s research at Super-Releaser he\u2019s designed pneumatic soft robots with the goal of generating complex practical mechanisms from simple, easily mass produced methods. He\u2019s going to bring his experience making things like a walking quadruped cast from one single seamless piece of silicone to a discussion of what\u2019s on the cutting edge of soft robotics, where these technologies can be applied, and how you can start playing with your own squishy robots.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Matthew Borgatti is the founder of Super-Releaser, a soft robotics company dedicated to bringing human compatible robots out of the lab by making their design and manufacture cheap and simple. Super-Releaser is currently developing medical device prototypes, collaborating with universities offering soft robotics manufacturing expertise, and hacking away at the core technologies involved in making better robots.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Matthew Borgatti got his start in prototyping in the film industry, making animatronic props for movies including Snakes on a Plane and Aliens Vs Predator 2. He combined the techniques he learned casting lifelike monsters in silicone with CAD and materials science learned earning an industrial design degree at RISD.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition.

Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p>Personal Branding with Purpose is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand. It's about learning how to live your personal brand by sharing your authentic self and communicating clearly the value you can provide others.

Plus it\u2019s no fun is it to risk rejection over and over again striking up conversations with people you don't even know are single,if you even get the courage to speak to them. And if the conversation goes well it is still awkward exchanging phone numbers.<\/p> <p>\u00a0With Speed Dating, you meet up to 12 (and sometimes more) singles your age range\u00a0in about 2 hours. Afterwards, if there's interest (you discreetly circle on your interest sheet who you would like to hear from again), you'll get an email with links to contact these event participants.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

The cost is $1.50 during rush hours (4-6pm), but you are free to buy the \"Underground Fare\" ticket for $0.70 anytime before\/after that rush hour time window. Take the Grove St train and get off at the Warren St\/NJIT station stop. It is 3 stops away (5 minute ride) from Penn Station. When you get off, take the stairway to your left.

Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other.

The cultures and economies of the fashion industry and the city of New York have been and continue to be intertwined. The cultural economic impact of the fashion industry on New York City cannot be overstated. New York City\u2019s fashion industry employs 180,000 people and accounts for 6% of the city workforce, generating $10.9 billion a year in total wages, and tax revenues of $2 billion. An estimated 900 fashion companies are headquartered in the city. New York Fashion Week contributes about $850 million a year to the local economy\u2014about twice the economic impact of the 2014 Super Bowl.<\/p> <p>Fashion is more than ever part of a wider landscape that intersects with other creative industries (media, visual arts, design, film, craft). Fashion, its manufacturing and culture industry, and its complex media apparatus have contributed to the transformation and histories of several world cities. In many cases, as in New York City, women and immigrants were largely responsible for building the garment industry; and it was their work that intersected with social reforms, political activism, gradual urban transformation and processes of globalization and gentrification.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSome of the questions the conference will address are:<\/p> <p>How and why does a city become a Global Fashion Capital?<br\/>What role do the social media and the post-digital experience of today play?<br\/>How can labor, craft and design survive in the era of Instagram?<br\/>How do new technologies and big data affect our ways of life, thinking and consuming the city in the city?<br\/>Is there a new rhythm analysis that needs to be understood?<br\/>And how can we strengthen our right to the city and allow a new humanitarian sensibility and politics?<\/p> <p>This one-day symposium is presented by Fashion Studies at The Graduate Center and the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies, in collaboration with the School of Visual, Media &amp; Performing Arts at Brooklyn College and The Museum at FIT, and the support of Women\u2019s Studies Certificate Program, the Master in Women\u2019s Studies, The Committee on Globalization and Social Change, Data &amp; Society, and The Futures Initiative.<\/p> <p>A still from D.W.

Tournament please just go through our Join Page:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNewYork.com\/join\"><a href=\"http:\/\/TennisNewYork.com\/join\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/TennisNewYork.com\/join<\/a><\/a><br\/>***********************<\/p> <p><br\/><b>How does the TennisNewYork Tournament Work?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Every Match Counts *NEW* for 2015<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Tennis Tournament Basic Concept<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments are a single elimination format with a consolation bracket. Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNewYork staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNewYork staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnewyork.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special Note for NYC players: We don't have any special privileges to use the courts throughout New York City. You do need to follow by the rules provided by the Parks Department. How to reserve tennis courts in NYC: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/sub_things_to_do\/facilities\/af_tennis.html\">NYC Park &amp; Rec.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The cost will be $19.95 per tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Join Today!!<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 So <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnewyork.com\/join\">Join Today<\/a> and we'd be happy to get you enrolled into the next tournament.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Tennis-League\/events\/224849809\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Oct.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/225990411\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Tuesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"225990411","time":1444770000000,"updated":1444781631000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"22 Linden Blvd","name":"Flatbush Branch Library","lon":-73.958366,"id":21188852,"lat":40.652184,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":6.97293043137,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442144540000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out to the crochet circle.\u00a0 Many of you have requested that I meet up after work.

Entrepreneurs, small business owners, sales professionals, and career changers will all benefit from a greater knowledge of business development skills.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startups-Helping-Startups\/events\/225641749\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":7200000,"name":"Biz Dev Workshop for Startups","id":"225641749","time":1444773600000,"updated":1444781645000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425696522000,"name":"Startups Helping Startups | NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18483007,"urlname":"Startups-Helping-Startups","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Earlyvangelists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"10005","address_1":"3rd Floor, Suite 200","name":"40 Exchange Place, New York, NY","lon":0,"id":23976227,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437421750000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every 2nd Tuesday<\/p> <p>6:00-8:00 PM<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/where.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/where.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>40 Exchange Place 3rd Floor, Suite 200 New York, NY 10005<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/who.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/who.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>People who\u2026<\/p> <p>\u2013 Are Nice<\/p> <p>\u2013 Want to Change Lives<\/p> <p>\u2013 Has a Message to Share<\/p> <p>\u2013 Wants to make some money<\/p> <p>\u2013 Are Givers and Collaborators!<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cost.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cost.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>No cost!<\/p> <p>Light snacks and beverages will be available for you to\u00a0enjoy.<\/p> <p>Come twice to check us out!<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/rsvp.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/rsvp.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>It sure is nice but if you run out of time\u2026<\/p> <p>come on in!<\/p> <p>Contact the Executive Director to RSVP (:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/contacts.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/contacts.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>Kaneen Morgan:<\/p> <p>Executive Director<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>Marcia Chambers:<\/p> <p>Co-Executive Director<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/bottom.gif\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/publicspeakersassociation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/bottom.gif\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>Venue Address: \u00a040 Exchange Place, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10005. \u00a0Every 2nd Tuesday of the month.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:<\/p> <p>Who is MaKey MaKey For?<\/p> <p>Artists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone.<\/p> <p>How Does it Work?<\/p> <p>Alligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and a banana.<\/p> <p>When you touch the banana, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.<\/p> <p>Make + Key = MaKey MaKey!<\/p> <p>What materials work with MaKey Makey?<\/p> <p>Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:<\/p> <p>Other materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more\u2026<\/p> <p>Why Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?<\/p> <p>We believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.<\/p> <p>We are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change.

An example of 3 hours of deep testing\"<\/i><\/p> <p>Too often in talks about testing there is very little talk about testing. That's because it's not easy to talk about it. The true nature of testing is hard to speak. Many people feel as if it's so artful or mysterious that it's pointless to discuss details. I say nay. I say we can talk about it... but it takes practice to get good at it. In this talk I will get more practice talking about the fine details of deep testing, and you will be the judge of how obscure and mysterious it is.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The substance of the testing I did was three hours carefully analyzing the accuracy of a particular kind of chart. I used mathematics and tools in reasonable ways to fulfill my mission. This culminated in two conclusions: 1) the chart is accurate enough. 2) well, I'm a little embarrassed about my second conclusion, so you will have to come and see what it is for yourself.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>James Bach<\/b>\u00a0is a consulting software tester and author of Lessons Learned in Software Testing, as well as Secrets of a Buccaneer-Scholar.

And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Thur\/Fri) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket unless you buy a gift card at the theater and pre-load it. 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to driver there in advance if you want seats near us. OR you can just show up that night and sit wherever there is space available.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Hope to see YOU at the movies!!\u00a0 Love, Cassie<\/p> <p><b><i>if you can't make it, no need to post why.

As a matter of fact, an early college career assessment test had Joe pegged as a Tug Boat Operator!<\/p> <p>Born in upstate NY, he's the \u201cmiddle boy\u201d of six kids. His sister gave him this title because she was the only girl with five brothers.<\/p> <p>Joe fell down the cellar stairs at the age of at two, earning him a few stitches. When he was nine years old, he accidentally set himself on fire with diesel fuel! Challenged by school, he failed second grade and was branded \u201cmath challenged\u201d in high school. There, he was not only sentenced to remedial math classes, but also forced to quit his favorite sports of soccer and wrestling because he was bullied.<\/p> <p>Joe\u2019s high energy and love for physical activity fit well when he discovered bodybuilding. This not only increased his muscle mass, but was also the beginning of the long path to grow his self-esteem. Even though bodybuilding, coupled with his love for the outdoors, was a great outlet for his enormous passion and energy, these outlets alone couldn't satisfy his intellectual hunger. His restless curiosity was searching for something to grab onto, and college was a natural fit.<\/p> <p>Through a suggestion from a co-worker, Joe went back to school to pursue his second degree, Engineering. Texas A&amp;M was the beginning of a journey that, on the surface seemed to be bright, but was almost ending before it was to begin. Even though Joe had almost an insatiable curiosity to learn, college was not easy for him. After his first semester he was failing out! He was faced with a very important crossroad in life. Most of us give up when life seems to be heading in the wrong direction, Joe chose differently, he chose to stay in college and dig deep!<\/p> <p>___________________________________________________<\/p> <p>Every month, The New York \u00a0Power Team features a special guest speaker delivering content on a variety of topics of interest to high performers like you.

Many of these breakthroughs will be in the realm of democratized energy \u00a0- the ability to collect, store, and sell energy from your own private property. In addition, the IoT is going to bring more ubiquitous and sensitive sensors which can monitor and optimize our energy usage on a minute-by-minute basis.<\/p> <p><b>The New Market For Energy<\/b><\/p> <p>Solar power currently has the most direct connection to the idea of energy democratization, due to its low cost and relative material abundance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>With the efficiencies of solar and other energy collection \u00a0and storage methods increasing, we're going to start seeing energy surpluses in private homes. The ability to sell that energy to your neighbors or to your city is going to become a reality very quickly.<\/p> <p><b>Sensors and IoT<\/b><\/p> <p>An increasing number of sensors and apps that measure our daily activities, from our exercise to our productivity, is going to begin to be applied to energy.<\/p> <p>A smart energy grid will be able to route the right amount of energy, at the right price, at the right time, to your home. In addition to that, you'll begin to have more visibility over how much energy you're using and how to save money and save the environment through greater energy awareness.<\/p> <p><b>This Think Tank<\/b><\/p> <p>All of these breakthroughs are right around the corner, and it's up to the entrepreneur and researcher to push these breakthroughs to the larger markets.<\/p> <p>At this Think Tank we'll begin to look at the current concept of a real smart energy grid.

Since she lives in japan, She draws settings in Japan. She thinks to draw not only fun and heartwarming works but also people in various scenes.<\/p> <p>Under the aging society in Japan, there are many social problems such as child abuse, irregular employment, and an increase in poor people receiving livelihood protections. Including such things, she thinks she will continue drawing with the theme of people.<\/p> <p>Her works are drawn from both real experiences and imaginations. She thinks she could send cries through drawings to the generations to live a future. She would like the visitors of her solo exhibition to experience not only one emotion but their own feelings.<\/p> <p>In addition to her works, as an artist she started a project to distribute sketchbooks to children living in child welfare facilities, homeless people, and impoverished people, with the hope that expressing themselves will enrich their minds.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It raised eyebrows in their lifetimes and has only become more controversial since their deaths. From FDR\u2019s lifelong romance with Lucy Mercer to Eleanor\u2019s purported lesbianism\u2014and many scandals in between\u2014the American public has never tired of speculating about the ties that bound these two headstrong individuals. Some claim that Eleanor sacrificed her personal happiness to accommodate FDR\u2019s needs; others claim that the marriage was nothing more than a gracious fa\u00e7ade for political convenience. No one has told the full story until now.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this groundbreaking new account of the marriage, Hazel Rowley describes the remarkable courage and lack of convention\u2014private and public\u2014that kept FDR and Eleanor together. She reveals a partnership that was both supportive and daring. Franklin, especially, knew what he owed to Eleanor, who was not so much behind the scenes as heavily engaged in them. Their relationship was the product of FDR and Eleanor\u2019s conscious efforts\u2014a partnership that they created according to their own ambitions and needs.<\/p> <p>In this dramatic and vivid narrative, set against the great upheavals of the Depression and World War II, Rowley paints a portrait of a tender lifelong companionship, born of mutual admiration and compassion. Most of all, she depicts an extraordinary evolution\u2014from conventional Victorian marriage to the bold and radical partnership that has made Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt go down in history as one of the most inspiring and fascinating couples of all time.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The group will be in the side, glass-enclosed room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club\/events\/219558821\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":7200000,"name":"October Book Discussion","id":"zcltdlytnbqb","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444850616000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1291650343000,"name":"Bay Ridge Book, Game and Social Club","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1747047,"urlname":"Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10605","country":"us","city":"White Plains","address_1":"252 Bryant Avenue","name":"The LOFT: LGBT Community Services Center ","lon":-73.745842,"id":8751502,"state":"NY","lat":41.021423,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.7255401611,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1401905943000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open topic group run by a trained facilitator who identifies as a peer of the group participants. \u00a0Come with something on your mind to talk about!<\/p> <p>This discussion and activity group is open to anyone who identifies as bisexual or are questioning their sexuality.<\/p> <p>Takes place the 2nd and 4th Tuesday evenings of each month, starts at 7:30 pm.<\/p> <p>No charge to attend, but a $5.00 donation is welcome.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Directions to The LOFT Center can be found at www.loftgaycenter.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheLOFTLGBTCenter\/events\/225840633\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Bisexual Peer Support Group (2nd Tuesday of Month)","id":"dfgxrjytnbrb","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444791780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344889664000,"name":"The LOFT: LGBT Community Services Center","group_lon":-73.75,"id":4538572,"urlname":"TheLOFTLGBTCenter","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"LOFTies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"80 5th Ave","name":"Namaste Healing Center","lon":-73.993813,"id":23926076,"lat":40.735729,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.00818300247,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441288788000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our ongoing meeting that occurs that SECOND and FORTH TUESDAY of the month.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gangaji-Video-Satsang\/events\/225092407\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":5400000,"name":"Gangaji Video Satsang","id":"225092407","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444786353000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1433641886000,"name":"Gangaji Video Satsang","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18654249,"urlname":"Gangaji-Video-Satsang","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Satsang members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10605","country":"us","city":"White Plains","phone":"914-948-2932","address_1":"252 Bryant Avenue","name":"The LOFT","lon":-73.746014,"id":769965,"state":"NY","lat":41.021411,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":22.7197265625,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1292970726000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/b\/b\/600_7042203.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come join your peers from Westchester County and the surrounding areas <i>(hello Bronx, Connecticut, Orange and Putnam Counties)<\/i> for our long-running lively, friendly facilitated discussion group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our group is for ALL people <i>(cisgender, transgender\/gender non-conforming, and not-quite-sure people)<\/i> as well as people who fall on different places along the monogamous to polyamorous dimension.
