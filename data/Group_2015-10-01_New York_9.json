Join the thousands of Citizens Climate Lobby members who are actually moving Congress toward bold climate solutions that could change everything. <br> CCL will change the way you think about democracy. We're not about marches and protests-- we're about you talking directly to your Senators, Congressmen and their top advisers. If you want to make real change happen, this is an incredibly effective form of advocacy. You will be amazed at how much power you have as an informed and inspired citizen. <br> There are lots of ways you can inform and influence your members of Congress-- through letters, emails, phone calls, newspaper articles, and through live meetings with your Congressman, Senators and their advisers. We'll teach you how to do any or all of the above-- wherever your comfort zone takes you. And we'll inspire you to maximize your effectiveness as an advocate for real climate solutions. <br> Best of all, we have a plan and a solid climate proposal for Congress that's actually gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. It is non-partisan, politically viable, scientifically sound, and economically feasible. Economists say it is the most cost efficient approach. Scientists say it is our best shot at saving the planet. <br> We think New York area citizens deserve a special seat at the table when climate change is being discussed because when it comes to climate impacts and sea-level rise, they have a lot at stake. So we are focused on uniting New York area &nbsp;citizens this year. We already have established local CCL chapters in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens\/Nassau, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester, and Columbia counties in NY, as well as Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Red Hook, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, NY, in Fairfield County in Connecticut, and in Central New Jersey. <br> Join us for an introductory conference call or New York Area Local meeting near you! <br> Website info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com<\/a> <br> What does climate scientist Dr. James Hansen say about CCL?\"Most impressive is the work of the Citizens Climate Lobby, a relatively new, fast-growing, nonpartisan, nonprofit group with [193] chapters across the United States and Canada.

You keep jumping medium to medium; you started with a novel about your dad's psychosis and now you've decided maybe a TV series on gentrification might be better.<\/p>\n<p><span>You need new energy, new resolve.

This group is open to anyone who is interested in improving their fitness, losing weight, getting stronger and becoming more flexible. My classes are primarily focused on quality, not quantity meaning I'm looking for proper form and technique while using full range of motion. Each exercise circuit is timed to ensure everyone goes at their own pace. I also use progression and regression methods based on fitness levels to ensure you are getting to most out your workout. I don't like to call my class boot camp because it sounds like a hard core, going all out until you puke class. Rather, I like to call it personal group training because its intimate in size and I can give the small groups of 10 or less individualized attention.

In addition, we have noticed that most of the language assistance content has been focused on oral communication and reading of non-fiction\/short articles in English.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The organizers of this new meetup hope to bring back the meetings to the local community: Queens. In addition to English speaking and language and cultural exchange,\u00a0we will also be focusing on writing--both academic and creative (pros\/poetry) as well as reading fiction, non-fiction, short essays, articles, excerpts from books, and poems every two weeks. Hopefully, the readings will spark discussion about themes, concepts, ideas and issues relevant the Asia diaspora; Asian American; Pacific Islander and immigrant experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our target audience is those of Asian descent in NY (Manhattan, Queens, LI, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens). Book lovers, writers, and students are encouraged to join our meetings. Whether you are a novice writer, who needs feedback, criticism, or even proof-reading; or an accomplished writer, who would like to see how your writing will be accepted by the public and how people will be impacted by your writing; or a student working on a research paper for school; in all cases, we encourage you to submit your writing and join our meet-up group. Hopefully, these original pieces will also stimulate discussion relevant to diverse Asian communities in NY and the immigrant and international experience that is NYC.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of writing are encouraged: short stories, poems, articles or essays. There will also be opportunities for peer-to-peer proofreading and also sharing your original writings with the group. There also maybe workshops on how to advance your research skills using our American library system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0And, finally, we hope to include events and activities that will allow our members to explore the city and get to know each other better. Events such as book readings and signings, dinners, or events at the Asian American Writers Workshop, or visits to interesting but obscure used bookstores, will be included. Our Meetups will be in warm environments like city parks or cafes in Queens.

I've done the bar scene, I've done the intellectual scene, the party scene, the museum scene, etc...And as much as I like pieces of each of those things, but never seem to fit in perfectly to any particular group. So I decided to start a meetup group that was a combination of all of those things...&lt;br&gt; If you've been in NYC for a long time and have been there and done that and you are looking for something more, this is the group for you. If you just got to NYC this is a great way to balance off all the rock star partying you've been doing with seeing what the greatest city on earth has to offer lol:)&lt;br&gt; I want to set up events and fun things to do that are just a little bit more intellectual, just a little more advocacy related, for people who care just a little bit more about life:) If you are passionate and fun, aren't afraid of caring about the world or using your brain while getting shit faced for example, or are always up for an adventure then you are in the right place.&lt;br&gt; Some events will be a little bit more heavier (like our first weeks) and thought provoking and some a little bit more fun and light hearted (like our second weeks). If you ever have suggestions for events, I'm all ears :)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/3\/6\/2\/highres_425944962.jpeg","photo_id":425944962,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/3\/6\/2\/600_425944962.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/3\/6\/2\/thumb_425944962.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":124415862,"name":"Matina"},"members":283,"name":"FUn Things tO do iN NYC That MaKe SenSe! :)","id":16517232,"state":"NY","urlname":"FUn-Things-tO-do-iN-NYC-That-MaKe-SenSe","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"True New Yorkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1408576699000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"virtualization","name":"Virtualization","id":20479},{"urlkey":"devops","name":"DevOps","id":87614},{"urlkey":"iaas-infrastructure-as-a-service","name":"IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)","id":107633},{"urlkey":"converged-infrastructure","name":"Converged Infrastructure","id":112652},{"urlkey":"infrastructure-management","name":"Infrastructure Management","id":122532},{"urlkey":"cloud-infrastructure","name":"Cloud Infrastructure","id":793352},{"urlkey":"vdi-virtual-desktop-infrastructure","name":"VDI - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure","id":1051932}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ConvergedInfrastructureNYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Welcome!<\/p>\n<p>Converged Infrastructure\u00a0New York City group (CINYC) is a forum for gaining awareness and exchanging ideas around practical benefits of convergence of business and technology. \u00a0Each one of us is, in some way, focused on bridging the gap between business requirements and the properly structured set of technologies to address such requirements. \u00a0 We are sensitive to the dichotomy that often exists between various groups in large organizations and we are passionate about taking a collaborative approach to closing such gaps. \u00a0We are here to learn, to help each other recognize and reap rewards promised by convergence of\u00a0infrastructure - a relatively new trend focused on lowering the cost of operating cloud environments by engineering and packaging technology stacks.<\/p>\n<p>See:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Converged_infrastructure\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Converged_infrastructure<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We exist to help facilitate meetups where professionals &amp; end-users can share best practices for valuing, deploying and operating CI technologies. \u00a0Professionals and experts can become aware of new market needs, and new users can gain practical knowledge, expand their foundations about market trends; everyone can grow their professional network.

We know the fear that bubbles up every time we're asked our name, or need help finding an address, ordering food, or even just meeting an old friend. We go to therapy- some of us for years- spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars- trying to free our words.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even with every physical skill in the book at our disposal, however, \u00a0something's missing. \u00a0We're still not convinced we have a right to share, loud and clear, the stories, opinions, and quirks that make us who we are. That's because the key to a full life isn't in the hour-a -week spent in the clinic support group, trying to pour your heart out in the three minutes you have before someone starts getting antsy. Talking about what's going on inside certainly has its place in the therapy process, but lasting change can only come from <i>living loudly<\/i>- actually going out into the world and communicating, on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>That's why I (we ) started NYFS. We're planning on regular ( once a week to two weeks) meetups- some just to hang out, and some structured in such a way that we each face a particular type of communication challenge, with the support of the group behind us. This desensitizes us to the fear of disfluent speech,; the fear of being different.<\/p>\n<p>Examples include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Going into a department store and asking where you might find the dinner plates<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 \u00a0Asking a bus driver for directions as people are getting on ( to help experience time pressure)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Placing complicated pizza orders over the phone.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Talking to a member of the opposite ( or same) sex that you'd like to get to know better, romantically or otherwise<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Talking to a stranger in the park about what you're doing and what stuttering is exactly ( you'd be surprised at how receptive most people are to it!)<\/p>\n<p>Now, we know that everyone is in a different place with their stuttering. That's why, for the first few weeks, we'll be splitting people into groups based on what they're comfortable with- Easy, Medium, and Difficult challenges. I or another group leader will be available to help talk you through what you're feeling beforehand and to offer support, no matter where you're at.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><i>We<\/i><\/b> <b><i>ARE NOT<\/i> \u00a0licensed speech pathologists, and don't claim to offer therapy.

We are a separate entity and nobody has to join anything to work with us.<\/p>\n<p>We sit around a big wooden table and we talk about what we want to change about ourselves and what we have to do to make that happen. New habits we want to cultivate. Old habits we want to let go of. Beliefs or reactions we have that are harmful to us and other people. Sometimes we discuss ethics or science or religion.<\/p>\n<p>We decide on goals for ourselves and go to the Ethics Lab to report and for support.<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<p>Mindfulness meditations. Losing weight. Finding a correct lay monastery to join. Developing your critical faculties by use of formal logic and\/or mathematics. Overcoming addictions including addictions to emotions or ideas. Gaining weight. Expressing yourself through artwork. Prayer. Joining a group so you can trick yourself into reinventing yourself. Yoga. Finding a boyfriend or girlfriend. Jogging. Changing careers.<\/p>\n<p>Someone pointed out that we are keeping the art of conversation alive. Yep. With a bit of Socratic method, performance art and good old fashioned magic smoke &amp; mirrors mixed in.<\/p>\n<p>Three examples of the kind of thing I might recommend to someone during a talk at the Ethics Lab.<\/p>\n<p>1. Decide on the thing you want to change in yourself and then only commit to observing yourself as it is happening as the very first step.<\/p>\n<p>2. Taking the time to find out what your thoughts and feelings are about your thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n<p>3. Understanding that meditating can be whatever you are doing at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>An Ethics Lab is a place where people with different even opposing beliefs meet and learn that we are of value to each other because of those differences. It\u2019s a lab because we see being wrong as an opportunity to learn. <\/p>\n<p>I enjoy witnessing people deciding to change then doing it. I also enjoy telling their stories. I\u2019m a writer so I see the Ethics Lab as a mix of everything from poetry to journalism. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned so much from the folks who have sat at the table with me since September of last year. Every account of conscious change I can pass on makes it easier for someone, somewhere.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin\" class=\"linkified\"><\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/highres_403135252.jpeg","photo_id":403135252,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/600_403135252.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/thumb_403135252.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":157419312,"name":"Vincent Downing"},"members":56,"name":"Ethics Lab of Brooklyn","id":16620532,"state":"NY","urlname":"Ethics-Lab-of-Brooklyn","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"mental tinkerers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1409096947000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/firstfridays-nyc\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>First Fridays NYC is a platform for Next Jumpers and guests to learn from thought leaders and experts on a diverse range of topics.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to create a way for us all to continue learning as well as set up an avenue for individuals to give back to the NYC community.

We already have this capability in place. However, in complex systems, the real operational challenges arise from the way system components interact. Some of these components live inside our data center, some live outside our data center, and all are updating on differing timelines. The functionality and performance of every component has the potential to change every day.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge is to identify patterns and correlations across multiple systems in our stack. We need to integrate top-down and bottom-up analysis, so we can see, for example, that trial subscription signups (a user metric) fell off at the same time that an internal API call began to fail (an application metric), and it was caused by a database host falling offline (a system metric).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>When collecting so much data, there is a risk of being overwhelmed and not being able to make sense of it all. In essence, a risk of collecting data but not producing intelligence. We combat this risk by converting our accumulated data into the most visually information-dense format available: graphs.

Acting now is in America\u2019s best interest.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n The Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street is the game changer for a fairer, more democratic, humane, balanced, and moral American Tax System<\/p>\n<p>This tiny sales tax on Wall Street is:<br>\n\n .5% on stocks, just $.50 (50 cents) for each $100 of stock trades;<br>\n\n .1% on bonds, just $.10 (ten cents) for each $100 of bond trades;<br>\n\n .005% on derivative speculation in currencies, commodities, or other trades, just $.005 (half a penny) for each $100 of trades<\/p>\n<p>The revenue generated is estimated by economists to be up to 350 billion each year! The Robin Hood Tax can mean slightly less for the 1% at the top and lots more for the 99% below.<\/p>\n<p>Our Current Sales Tax System Does Not Tax the Items That the Top 10% American Households (by Wealth) almost exclusively own.<br>\n\n Things everyone has to buy have a Sales Tax like toilet paper, toothpaste, cars, condo\u2019s and homes. Things only the top 10% of Wealthy Households buy have no sales tax. Sadly that\u2019s True.<\/p>\n<p>Even Worse the top ten percent of American Households have 81% to 94% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and almost 80% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-producing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America. Sadly this is another clear example of: Those that have the gold get to make the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations representing over 100,000,000 Americans are now involved with the American Robin Hood Tax Campaign. Thousands of endorsers, 100\u2019s of Organization endorsers, over 1,000 economists, the Vatican, Some of the brightest minds in the country and the 4 of the richest men in America, have endorsed the Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Three Benefits of the Robin Hood Tax<br>\n\n Although every Robin Hood Tax has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.<br>\n\n Curbing volatility of financial markets<br>\n\n In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, \"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.\" Rescuing enterprise from becoming \"the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation\" was also an intended purpose of the Robin Hood Tax and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes.<br>\n\n More fair and equitable tax collection<br>\n\n Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. An Automated Payment Robin Hood tax taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.<br>\n\n According to several leading figures, the \"fairness\" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and\/or replaced, \"prevention of volatility\" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative is one such economist: he sees a Robin Hood Tax as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.[23]<br>\n\n Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives<br>\n\n According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to tax avoidance and tax evasion than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. An Automated Payment Robin Hood Tax employs 21st century technology for automatically assessing and collecting taxes when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking payments system. Stop Blaming the Poor for Wall Streets Greed<\/p>\n<p>Warren Buffett isn\u2019t the only rich guy who wants to higher taxes on the rich, such as The Robin Hood tax which he has specifically endorsed. A survey from Spectrem Group found that 68% of millionaires (those with investments of $1 million or more) support raising taxes on those with $1 million or more in income. Fully 61% of those worth of $5 million or more support increased taxes on million-plus earners.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/highres_409075492.jpeg","photo_id":409075492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/600_409075492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/c\/4\/thumb_409075492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":170802232,"name":"Robin Hood"},"members":4,"name":"Manhattan - Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street Campaign Events","id":16974892,"state":"NY","urlname":"Robin-Hood-Tax-on-Wall-Street-Campaign-Events-USA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Robin Hood's Team Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410639851000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"night-photography","name":"Night Photography","id":32968},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"night-photography-workshop","name":"night photography workshop","id":127998}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYNight\/","rating":4.42,"description":"<p>New York has a long, rich history of night photography.

We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, will be judged, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can\u2019t trust the future, we need more ambition and drive, and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world \u2014 full-out. We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be. For more information about Byron Katie and her work, go to thework.com or read her book Loving What Is. There are plenty of youtube.com videos of Katie doing The Work with others and explaining how The Work works. &nbsp;Another good addition to this meetup is my meetup \"Marketing for Artists and Other Creative People\" at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Marketing-for-Artists-and-Other-Creative-People\/grow\/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you soon at our meet up! &nbsp; &nbsp;Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14005872,"name":"DezVFX"},"members":1487,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","id":17017142,"state":"NY","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Creative People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410833210000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"ballroomdance","name":"Ballroom Dancing","id":3998},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"merengue","name":"Merengue","id":20216},{"urlkey":"ballroom-latin-salsa-swing-tango-hustle","name":"Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Swing, Tango, Hustle","id":20839},{"urlkey":"hustle-dancing","name":"Hustle Dancing","id":21002},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"latin-dancing-salsa-merengue","name":"Latin Dancing - Salsa, Merengue","id":33158},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"salsa-classes","name":"Salsa Classes","id":44955},{"urlkey":"salsa-for-singles","name":"Salsa for Singles","id":52314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProAmDanceTeamNYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Do You enjoy dancing Latin, Ballroom, Salsa or all of these dances?

As each year passes, and our world remains incapable of summoning the will to respond meaningfully, the crisis grows more menacing, and the cost of our eventual, inevitable response increases. This cost is measured not in millions, but in billions of dollars that could easily extend into the trillions. But that\u2019s not our primary concern.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Our problem is that in 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that Americans ranked global warming near the bottom of Presidential and Congressional priorities for the years 2009 through 2014, and that only 44 percent of Americans currently believe there is solid evidence the phenomenon exists, and is anthropogenic. We believe that Climate Rescue Capitalism can play an important role in solving this problem.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Climate Rescue Capitalism is an economic tool that empowers our world\u2019s people to fight climate change every time we buy the products we routinely buy. It is a way to use capitalism to directly fight climate change, rather than to further enrich the corporations that are preventing our world from taking responsible action on climate change. In other words, Climate Rescue Capitalism calls on humanity to go into business for the sake and interests of humanity, and market products that compete with, and win against, products marketed by today\u2019s controlling population.<\/p>\n<p>I refer to this market-based means of increasing humanity\u2019s ability to fight climate change as Climate Rescue Capitalism for two reasons. First, because it is a capitalist venture designed expressly to fund the fight against climate change. And second, because it is a free-market capitalist venture in every sense of the word. It requires no government participation, and infringes upon no one\u2019s personal, political or economic freedom. It is nothing more, or less, than the utilization of capitalist marketing principles and practices for the purpose of fighting climate change, rather than to further enrich the individuals and corporations whose stranglehold on our world\u2019s political will to fight climate change is no longer either ecologically sustainable, or morally acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>Will this new vehicle for channeling product profits toward the fight against climate change work? That\u2019s what this meetup group will explore.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you'll join us.<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\n\n George<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/a\/600_410977562.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/a\/highres_410977562.jpeg","photo_id":410977562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/a\/600_410977562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/a\/thumb_410977562.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3373400,"name":"George"},"members":36,"name":"Climate Rescue Capitalism - A Climate Change Economy","id":17040262,"state":"NY","urlname":"Climate-Rescue-Capitalism-A-Climate-Change-Economy","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Climate Rescuers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410936904000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"raising-capital","name":"Raising Capital","id":19120},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"angel-investors","name":"Angel Investors","id":29000},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"fund-raising","name":"Fund Raising","id":54237},{"urlkey":"seed-funding","name":"Seed Funding","id":62649},{"urlkey":"startup-financing","name":"Startup Financing","id":153731}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Meetup-Raising-Funds-For-Your-Business\/","rating":0,"description":"Whether you've been doing business for five weeks or for five years , an inclusion of funds is anytime welcome.

TO THE ORIGINAL BRONX DESIGN MEETUP GROUP<\/p>\n<p>About The Organizer: <br><\/p>\n<p>Hi! My Name is Monica Liu. I started an online Art and Design service named Mon Liu Designs and Art Studio. I run a guest house in The Bronx for traveling artists and professionals who comes from all over the world, currently looking to expand our studios into Queens, hoping to break in to NYC soon. I graduated at The New York School of Interior Design, and an ongoing Student Artist at the Art Student League of New York. I am also a mother of a very open hearted toddler boy. I have covered a variety of mediums: Mix Media Art, Fiber Art, Paper Art and Origami, Painting, Drawing, Set and stage design, Photography and Filmmaking, Economical Friendly Art Installations, Murals, Technical Drafting, Interior Design, Computer-Aid-Design and Architecture.<br><\/p>\n<p>My interest in building a group is: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. To meet Designers and Artists where we can all exchange and learn from each others work. <br><\/p>\n<p>2. To create a meditative space where we can create our work.<\/p>\n<p>3. I make sure part of my meetups are dedicated to parents with small children who never had the chance to get to know the passion inside of themselves and hoping they can find a space here to create artistically. <br><\/p>\n<p>4. I am a lover of traveling so I love to hear and share stories from people that come from other countries and go to visit the country myself to learn about different cultures.<\/p>\n<p>If What you are looking for is 3 or more of the above, You are encouraged to join! We are all about creating a positive lifestyle with arts and retreats. <br><\/p>\n<p> About The Group:<br><\/p>\n<p>We are CREATIVE DESIGNERS who are not just about pick and choose materials for a space but also working creatively on making a space, indoor or out, into creative spaces such as customized ceiling murals, economical-friendly Installations\/ Visual Displays. <br><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever wonder how to get a project started? or have you gotten in the middle of a project and needed someone to give you a nudge to help you thinking outside the box so you can see the project at a new perspective? How about brainstorming with collages, or coming up with a design pattern for a partition wall? How do I achieve that result?&nbsp; I am here to help you spark that creativity within you.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>It sounds fantastic, and we need pure confidence. Knowing that we can make something seems impossible at times when we are so caught up in our lives. SO here I am, working on the creative person in me, I want to create a group to come together with those who are at a creative block at times like myself, we all need some inspiration. We all have build-up on creativity when we dont use it, We're are all talented with something. <br><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are at beginning level, Graduated or an Emerging Professional who did, or learning all aspects of design or getting creative with art projects, me and others are here to encourage you to get that project started and accomplished! To be sure that you get the practice with sufficient hands on experience. <br> <\/p>\n<p>We are based in the Bronx, but we will be holding some meet ups in New York City, go to shows &amp; events, design shops and workshops as we learn to do artistic things like drawing, painting and the process of making something creative. Depending on the experience of our Design Enthusiasts available, we hope to put together some hands-on real projects experiences and tailor meet ups according to our members, so be sure to let us know what you hope to achieve with us. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our group pages at the top panel, as we will consistently update inspirational websites of Art and Design Trends. Also, come back check out our calendar even when there are no meetup scheduled, we could be meeting up with other interior design group events in the city. If you have something in mind, be sure to let us know what you like to see and achieve at an upcoming meetup and we will surely do our best to tailor our meetups to the best of our group member's interest. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join us Now!<br> <\/p>\n<p>To get to know me and my company, please stay tune and find me on Pinterest and Facebook and the following links:<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest.com\/monliudesigns<\/p>\n<p><span>Mon Liu Designs Gallery &amp; Inspirations<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/\">&nbsp;&nbsp; https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/155577364485769\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/highres_440584449.jpeg","photo_id":440584449,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/600_440584449.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/1\/thumb_440584449.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55263712,"name":"Monica Judy Liu"},"members":23,"name":"Upper NYC Design & Art Group","id":17244512,"state":"NY","urlname":"UpperNyc-Design-Art-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Creative Designers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411850106000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-healing","name":"Meditation and Healing","id":24118},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Twin-Heart-Meditation-Pranic-Healing-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in meditation and\/or energy healing .

The teaching is one thing and takes exceptional people... still, it's the skilled, strategic, pro-active, organization, directorship and management part that is the really tough part.\u00a0 It takes the combination of educator, humanitarian and entrepreneur to implement such a mission. With all participants from administration to volunteers to equipment setup to instructors...we absolutely prefer the concept of the 'work WITH' mentality...we're not all that fond of the term 'work FOR'. A socialistic, democratic angle to building a company...perhaps...but it seems to work amazingly well with Beyond Rock. A feeling of ownership is essential to develop passion in an individual. That said, obviously there still needs to be an agreement on philosophy and mission and those individuals who thoughtfully plan &amp; guide - leading the course of events. They need to be sharp, very pro-active, extraordinarily communicative (staff, parents, students) and decisive.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/highres_415797942.jpeg","photo_id":415797942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/600_415797942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/5\/6\/thumb_415797942.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":116670792,"name":"Maria,Scott & Michael (founders)"},"members":94,"name":"Business Entrepreneurs With Music Education in Mind","id":17300272,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-Educators-With-Spiritual-Based-Business-in-Mind","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Music Educators Entrepreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412041509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"transgender","name":"TG","id":1237},{"urlkey":"genderqueer","name":"genderqueer","id":4562},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gender-fluid","name":"Gender Fluid","id":25560},{"urlkey":"gender-queer","name":"Gender Queer","id":34510},{"urlkey":"where-to-meet-other-tg-people","name":"Where to Meet other TG People","id":37560},{"urlkey":"shemales","name":"Shemales","id":49111},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392},{"urlkey":"queer-and-questioning","name":"Queer and Questioning","id":53773},{"urlkey":"male-to-female-mtf-transgender","name":"Male to Female, MTF, Transgender","id":62199},{"urlkey":"transsexuals","name":"Transsexuals","id":63635},{"urlkey":"transgender-women","name":"Transgender Women","id":67037},{"urlkey":"transgender-mtf","name":"Transgender MtF","id":138956},{"urlkey":"tgirl","name":"tgirl","id":503042},{"urlkey":"transgender-non-binary","name":"TransGender \u00b7 Non-Binary","id":1497202}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonbinary-Safe-Space-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>There are not a lot of safe spaces for nonbinary\/gender variant individuals to meet and socialize, so we've taken the liberty of creating one in NYC.

While we are primarily East Coast, Brooklyn based gamers, our online community contains gamers who we regularly play with across many different States (Utah, Colorado, New Orleans, Massachusetts... etc), across many different platforms and games. We also keep in contact with one another across many different mediums, such as facebook, skype, internet forums, and regular text. As gamers we are all adults, with full-time jobs, some with families, and\/or pursing further schooling. As a result, our atmosphere is drama-free, friendly, and mature. Who has time for drama when you have work in the morning? Ages 21+ is our preferred atmosphere. We enjoy online gaming not just as a hobby, but also a means to foster communities and build friendships. Many of us, are not just fellow gamers who share in a hobby, but are also real life friends. Many of those friendships were formed within different online gaming communities across the decade. We hope our meetup group will continue to build these types of positive relationships created by gaming. As a gaming group, we are an eclectic group with different tastes who all consider online gaming a hobby. Many of us are both casual and hardcore online gamers, with roots also stemming in tabletop and collectible card games (MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh, Versus, Pokemon, D&amp;D... etc).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We are currently engaged in Destiny for the Playstation 4 and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn across multiple platforms and are actively recruiting. While online guilds and clans are a-plenty, our group likes to know who we're playing with. If you're interested in joining our local online gaming community and our other extended online gaming community, we tend to meet-up at different places in Brooklyn and NYC.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>In addition, think of our meetup as a way to meet new people who might be playing other online games as well. We hope this is an opportunity to form brand new communities, organic, specifically to meetup. Take the opportunity to meet new people and see what types of games they play. It's a great opportunity to find similar ground in similar games, to build relationships in-game and as well as in real life.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Typically we meet at Xe May Sandwich Shop: 96 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009.

The rest of the time is for you to connect with like-minded people working on similar challenges.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Come and join us!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jJS5jMkbXNA\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jJS5jMkbXNA<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/highres_419137922.jpeg","photo_id":419137922,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/600_419137922.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/2\/2\/thumb_419137922.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":49605182,"name":"Edward Wisniewski"},"members":514,"name":"Designing Change","id":17471532,"state":"NY","urlname":"DesigningChange","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Movers and Shakers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Holmdel","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1412729466000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"autistic-spectrum-disorders","name":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders","id":21466},{"urlkey":"adult-teens-with-asperger-spectrum-disorders","name":"Adult\/Teens with Asperger\/Spectrum Disorders","id":22640},{"urlkey":"singles-with-aspergers","name":"Singles with Aspergers","id":23749},{"urlkey":"adults-with-aspergers-syndrome","name":"Adults with Asperger's Syndrome","id":25053},{"urlkey":"adult-aspies","name":"Adult Aspies","id":39225},{"urlkey":"asperger-syndrome","name":"Asperger Syndrome","id":77838},{"urlkey":"aspergers-support-group","name":"Asperger's Support Group","id":83682},{"urlkey":"aspergers-syndrome","name":"Aspergers Syndrome","id":100878},{"urlkey":"aspergers-social-group","name":"Asperger's Social Group","id":111988},{"urlkey":"friends-of-aspies","name":"Friends of Aspies","id":144388},{"urlkey":"social-skills-for-aspies","name":"Social Skills for Aspies","id":162162},{"urlkey":"parents-of-aspies","name":"Parents of Aspies","id":169331},{"urlkey":"parents-of-adult-aspies-support-group","name":"Parents of Adult Aspies Support Group","id":1355132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adult-Active-Jersey-Shore-Apies-Ages-18-100\/","rating":4.58,"description":"This is a group for anyone with Asperger's (self-diagnosed too) who wants to meet others, socialize, do some fun activities and share.

It started in 2003, during what was a fairly rough time to be politically liberal, as a group that was one-part support group and one-part strategy session, playing with slogans and ideas we thought the political left needed to be saying. And when we came up with a particularly good slogan, we made buttons. Occasionally, we bring in group questions, or talking points to back up the buttons. Sometimes our group list shares articles and forwards. But mostly, we keep it non-programmatic and free-flowing and create a space where people learn about each other's ideas, activities and enlarge a circle of progressive friends.

you're on the cusp of a big change in your life that you want to make the most of (a<\/span> <a>new job<\/a><span>, the end or beginning of a relationship, a big move, becoming a parent), or perhaps you're poised to take a big risk (maybe start that business you've always wanted, publish a novel,<\/span> <a>write a screenplay<\/a><span>, take a trip or <a>move abroad<\/a>, etc.). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Or maybe you don't know exactly what you want, you just know you're not where you want to be and you're ready for everything to change. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If

hearts we were meant to live -- and who are ready to start taking some big steps to find and follow our heart's calling. \u00a0<span>It does not matter what your background is, how old you are, what your profession is, or what stage of the journey you are at -- commitment to the journey itself is the only requirement here. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, succeeding in pursuing your heart's goals is not just about reaching\u00a0a fork in the road and choosing the\u00a0path less traveled -- it's also about\u00a0STAYING on that unbeaten path without running back to the old, \"safe\" path at the first sign of difficulty (a temptation that can be very hard to resist). \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0best way to do this -- indeed, perhaps the ONLY way to successfully do this -- is with the support of like-minded people, which is exactly what this group is about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for a series of free interactive workshops designed to support those of us who want to live an unbounded life full of unlimited possibilities -- a life where our heart's desires are not only possible, but, inevitable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The workshops will focus on such topics as risk-taking, recognizing and breaking through limiting beliefs, learning how to tap into and make the most of synchronicity, and the art of manifestation, among other topics. \u00a0We also want to hear from members as to what topics they'd like to have the free workshops cover. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The end-goal here is to share, learn from each other, support each other, bounce ideas off each other without judgment, and create a community that promotes and celebrates risk-taking for your heart's goals (which, unfortunately, our families, friends and society are not always on board with).

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

I'm also a visual person for my day job, so I can teach you some very basic technical principals, though I'll mostly talk about the composition of your frame. I'm mostly intuitive as opposed to overly technical, however, I'm very creative and perhaps I can help you \"see\" through your viewfinder in a different way. I'm very patient and non-judgmental - all that matters to me is that you want to have fun while improving the visual quality of your work.<\/p>\n<p>It would be better if you had a real camera (a point and shoot is fine) as opposed to a cell phone or ipad, but if that's all you have then I might be able to give you at least a couple of pointers. This won't be a super technical meetup, but I can get you on your way to having a nicely composed and well-lighted shot.<\/p>\n<p>Between meetups be sure to check the group message board on occasion, as I will be posting sites that can give you quick and easy tips to help you along in your photographic journey.<\/p>\n<p><span>Also - when going to one of our meetups please keep in mind that if you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event but then cannot make it and do not change your RSVP to \"No\" or send me a message you cannot attend (for two separate meetups), that you will be expelled from the group.

Brain Body Mastery has two main components. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindfulness\">mindfulness<\/a> and other types of meditation, or low stimulus attention control, meaning focusing in a slow and quiet way. The other component is high stimulus attention control, which is about taking simple movements and brain exercises, and integrating them into complex, whole brain activities. They are usually done at faster speed and can demand a fair amount of physical and mental effort. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The following videos explain what this group is about better than any of what's written here, but scroll down if you'd like to read more of what's behind all this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9a8Mz5lWzjg<\/a> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJT00Qdjpuk&amp;amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uPWHXFEwy4<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aNsNIqRVeDc&amp;index=20&amp;list=UUQThuzMvIkqC8wcVjTMjQFg<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for the FREE self-paced online course here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.effortwise.info\">www.effortwise.info<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span>The beauty of BrBd is that anyone can create new exercises. All it takes is curiosity and a little effort. Find two or more simple, separate activities and integrate them into one, and you grow your brain.

The implications reach far beyond just performing better at work or school. The more control you have over how your mind functions, the more quickly you can learn new skills, the more creative you can be, the more relaxed and present you can be, meaning you make better decisions.

I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn"},"members":26,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414861657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"italian","name":"Italian Language","id":184},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"italian-culture","name":"Italian Culture","id":15028},{"urlkey":"spanish-culture","name":"Spanish Culture","id":19169},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"italian-lessons","name":"Italian Lessons","id":29637},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-french","name":"Learn to Speak French","id":43377},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-italian","name":"Learn to Speak Italian","id":45489},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"learning-spanish","name":"Learning Spanish","id":50595},{"urlkey":"spanish-lessons","name":"Spanish lessons","id":51717},{"urlkey":"french-lessons","name":"French Lessons","id":82861}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Learn-to-Speak-FRENCH-ITALIAN-SPANISH-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in learning FRENCH, ITALIAN, and SPANISH language and culture in NYC!

Unfortunately, the world we live in is not as safe as it used to be, so it is important for us to be prepared in case something unfortunate happens.<br>\n\n This group is for anyone who is interested in learning real-life self defense. We will learn the self defense system taught in Taekwondo, along with Krav Maga, military combatives, and any other style that you may have trained in. All skill levels are welcome to join, we will all learn from each other in a fun and friendly environment. For those with little to no experience, we will start with the basics and increase complexity was we move along. For those with experience, be ready to get a good workout while furthering your arsenal of skills. We will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00pm to 8:00pm, but if we feel good, we can definitely go beyond 8:00pm. The head instructor will be Vinicius Raposa, who has over a decade of experience in various martial arts. Sir Raposa is an Internationally ranked Black Belt in Taekwondo, with unique self-defense experience developed from his time training with the Brazilian Marines at the Escola Naval, Rio de Janeiro and being the highest ranked Kombato practitioner in the United States.

When you join Free Fitness and Beauty Events - NYC meet up group, you'll get first wind of the latest beauty and fitness related parties, socials, in store events, launches, classes \/ workshops all happening in this great city of ours for absolutely zero dollars (and from time to time very steep discounts)!<\/p>\n<p><span> <br> <\/span> Sure you could comb the web for *some of these events and attend all by your lonesome, but going to these workout classes and beauty events stag, while common, kind of sucks. How can you enjoy your free cocktails, hors d'oeuvres and tunes or share your sense of accomplishment at completing a butt kicking working, if you don't know anyone else at the event because your friends are stuck at work \/ are too lame to go out \/ hate anything that doesn't involve drinking \/ or you're new in town?<\/p>\n<p>Having been to many of these fitness and beauty events I see participants who share so much in common barely connecting with each other because the social aspect isn't fostered or organized - (not that they're to blame.. it's enough work throwing together and hosting these things!)<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<p><b><i>That's where being a member of this meet up comes in handy!&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Because now you'll have a group of people who share your passion for all things beauty \/ fashion \/ fitness attending the events and your great meet up host to facilitate the introductions and conversations. You'll also get to discover and experience dance\/fitness classes and be exposed to new beauty brands that you may become a lifelong fan of!<\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>While we plan to organize many of our own exclusive events for members (the more members the more pull we have - so invite your friends!), we will also be sharing events that are open to the public and require RSVP's to get in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>I hope you'll see how awesome our group is and the immense value we have to offer.<\/span> <br> <\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/6\/7\/highres_435085191.jpeg","photo_id":435085191,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/6\/7\/600_435085191.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/6\/7\/thumb_435085191.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille"},"members":596,"name":"Free Fitness & Beauty Events","id":18138302,"state":"NY","urlname":"Free-Fitness-Beauty-Events-NYC","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Fitness & Beauty Event Insiders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1415382901000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"intdesign","name":"Interior Design","id":384},{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"construction","name":"Construction","id":9401},{"urlkey":"relocating","name":"Relocating","id":9878},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"telecommunications-industry","name":"Telecommunications Industry","id":26951},{"urlkey":"relocation","name":"relocation","id":59383},{"urlkey":"construction-professionals","name":"Construction Professionals","id":59907},{"urlkey":"moving","name":"Moving","id":86155},{"urlkey":"architects-and-interior-designers","name":"architects and interior designers","id":699492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Relocation-Network-NYC\/","rating":4.73,"description":"A networking group specifically for business relocation and renovation trades.
