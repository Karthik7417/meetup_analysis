This journey has led me to Reiki as a way of serving the my community. I became certified as a Usui Reiki Practitioner in October 2010; since then I have become a certified Usui Reiki Master and a registered Karuna Reiki\u00ae Practitioner. I started my practice in early 2011. I look forward to serving as a partner with you to benefit your overall health and wellbeing.<\/p> <p>Reiki (Rei \u2010 higher power, Ki \u2010 life force energy) is a natural healing modality that restores balance and harmony using light touch. Being energy-based, the recipient remains clothed. Reiki Healing can be used as an aid for clients in manifesting health and wellness for themselves. We make no representations about the ability to cure any disease or illnesses or ameliorate any psychological conditions; however, Reiki is known to reduce the pain, anxiety, and stress associated with disease, illness or psychological conditions. Reiki also instills sense of wellbeing in one\u2019s everyday life.<\/p>","why":"We all need healing!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/224809459\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Monthly Reiki Share\/Healing Circle","id":"fbxdllyvgblc","time":1461884400000,"updated":1461897122000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Greenbelt","address_1":"7501 Green Way Center Drive Suite 530","name":"WFG","lon":-76.875526,"id":18844052,"state":"MD","lat":39.004555,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.0582466125,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461277462000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/b\/600_449162891.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join The National Financial Literacy MOVEMENT!<\/p> <p>We are lauching a Nationwide financial Literacy\u00a0free workshops!<\/p> <p>Join the movement if you desire to increase your finances and build wealth.<\/p> <p>Would you like to learn how to build a strong financial future for yourself and your family?<\/p> <p>Do you wish you could learn how to invest your money from the comfort of your home?<\/p> <p>Learn the secrets of growing wealth, increase you cashflow, secure your financial future.<\/p> <p>learn how to have your money work for you.<\/p> <p>Learn wealth building strategies<\/p> <p>\u00a0Tax advantages of owning your own business<\/p> <p>How to have others work for you.<\/p> <p>Would you like to earn more money?<\/p> <p>Attend Free FINANCIAL WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS.<\/p> <p>TO LEARN \u00a0MORE<\/p> <p>CONTACT MARTINE ROC DRAGON<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>See You There!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wealth-Builders-Business-Networking-Group\/events\/230554019\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"INVITATION TO NATIONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY FREE WORKSHOP","id":"230554019","time":1461884400000,"updated":1461893670000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383165505000,"name":"Wealth Builders Business Networking Group","group_lon":-76.7900009155,"id":10908332,"urlname":"Wealth-Builders-Business-Networking-Group","group_lat":38.7999992371,"who":"Wealth Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.10431337357,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460672510000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>What will we do: Laugh together (and want to cry together) as we go from \u201cpancakes to peaches\u201d lift and round our butts with simple workout routines.

For people who have taken the original spoon bending class, \"The Alchemy of Spoon Bending,\" they have experienced first hand that techniques based on energy can soften the metal of spoons and forks enough so that what was not easily bent using physical force becomes miraculously malleable and easily bent.<\/p> <p>To get an idea of how difficult it is to bend a fork, you can get any ordinary fork and attempt to bend the tines. Even the strongest person will have difficulty bending most tines on forks. Using these techniques, the metal becomes easily bent by anyone particularly children. The above fork was completely bent in its final shape using the new quantum technique once.<\/p> <p>So why hold a spoon bending class? It is not about bending spoons and forks. The change in material reality as demonstrated by the bent forks is a model for change. The mechanisms tested are energy and quantum mechanics techniques.<\/p> <p>Because the worldview of energy and quantum mechanics is relatively new to modern life, it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate to people this reality; however, when people directly change their reality when they bend spoons and forks, their minds have direct physical proof that something changed in physical reality. Not only do they have direct proof; but, the proof happens to be what is considered one of the most \u201csolid\u201d aspects of physical reality.<\/p> <p>What is really exciting is that the fork in the above picture was bent not using the model of energy as taught in the previous class called the \"Alchemy of Spoon Bending\" but using techniques based on quantum mechanics and the unified field. The specific technique used for the fork above was called time travel in which I took the fork and sent it back in time to a condition where it would most easily bend in the above conformation. Voila. How cool is that!<\/p> <p>However, not only are the results cool but these same principles can be used for major shifts in healing and change. Some healers have been shown to mend broken bones instantaneously. Now people can get a direct experience as to how this might be possible and also how they can perform miracles in their daily life too. The principles demonstrated in this class access the same field of information as these miraculous healers.<\/p> <p>This technique plus at least nine more will be taught in the all new class called Quantum Spoon Bending. The class will include the following techniques: 1) Accessing the Field 2) Torus of the Heart 3) Time Travel 4) Dimensions 5) Spinning 6) Resonance 7) Frequency 8) Symbols 9) Embedding Intention (ie. Talisman Making) and the original technique 10) Accessing the Light.<\/p> <p>It is a \"quantum\" shift above the original class called the \"Alchemy of Spoon Bending\" which still contains important concepts in energy medicine. The original technique taught in the Alchemy class will be shown in the new class, plus the wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics as applied to healing and transformation. Each technique will be taught so that participants will have time to use the technique to bend the utensils. Then ample time will be given to show how each technique can be used in self-transformation and healing and to demonstrate the larger implications of each quantum concept.<\/p> <p>Early registration is important in order to provide adequate amount of materials.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>The cost is $55. \u00a0To register: class is now full.

In addition, he teaches a number of seminars that focus on the integration of science, spirituality, and healing. Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\"&gt;www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donuts driveway: Nourishing Journey, LLC is behind Dunkin Donuts, 3rd doorway on the right","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/228566382\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":9000000,"name":"Quantum Spoon Bending: a Model for Healing and Transformation","id":"228566382","time":1461969000000,"updated":1461980095000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21046","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"7271 Eden Brook Drive","name":"Orthodox Church of St Matthew","lon":-76.866707,"id":14623482,"state":"MD","lat":39.168331,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":15.6849412918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453508931000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You probably thought that you couldn\u2019t afford a Howard County personal trainer\u2026.now you can through The Boot Camp Girl program!<\/p> <p>Go to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebootcampgirl.com\/\">thebootcampgirl.com<\/a>\u00a0to check out our testimonials!<\/p> <p>By combining strength training, core conditioning, and high intensity cardio, we will help you to make your body a fat burning machine through boot camp and other workout sessions.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

These meditation sessions are secular and available to anyone wishing to meditate. All experience levels are welcome.

If you are new to meditation and you would like to discuss the technique one on one, please send me a message, and we can schedule time before meditation to go over the technique. After the meditation session we discuss the meditation experience, and also take in select readings from a variety of meditation masters.

It is transferred to the student by the Reiki Master during an attunement process. This process opens the crown, heart, and palm chakras and creates a special link between the student and the Reiki Source. The Reiki attunement is a powerful spiritual experience. The process is guided by the Rei or God-consciousness and makes adjustments in the process depending on the needs of each student.<\/p> <p>The Reiki attunement can start a cleansing process that affects the physical body as well as the mind and emotions. Toxins that have been stored in the body may be released along with blocked energies, feelings and thought patterns that no longer serve you.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Benefits of being attuned to Reiki.....<\/b><\/p> <p>Discover your true purpose in life<br\/>Balance Chakras and Aura<br\/>Achieve higher levels of energy and vitality, physically and emotionally (look and feel younger)<br\/>Produce and achieve your goals<br\/>Raise your vibration<br\/>Physical, mental and emotional healing<br\/>Enhanced intuitive awareness<br\/>Opening of the Third Eye<br\/>Raised level of consciousness<br\/>Release past traumas, blocks and limiting beliefs<br\/>Define your spiritual path<br\/>Find contentment, spiritual enlightenment and...<br\/>...the understanding that GOD and YOU are ONE<\/p> <p>I use the Chikara Reiki Do method of attunement. You will receive Usui Level I, Usui Level II, Usui Master and Tibetan Master all at once. This enables you to receive all the attunements at once at a much lower cost than the normal Usui methods of training where you would receive each attunement in separate classes over a longer period of time. This method is a total cost of $450 and taught in a 2 day class. You will receive a manual and 7 lessons in PDF and Word format that are to be completed before the actual class. If you are unable to attend both days, we can work something out individually. <b>$175 is due at sign up and the remaining is due at your first day of class. You would spend approx. 4-6 hours depending upon the # of students.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Some people may view this manner of attunement as an \"overload\", however, I firmly believe that you are drawn to what will benefit you the most. The pace of human evolution is quickening to the point where all are capable of receiving this method.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your time with me will consist of discussion, questions you have regarding the manual and lessons, guided meditations, the attunements and practice. You will learn the history and principles of Reiki as well as the fundamental techniques for giving a reiki treatment to yourself and others. There is a separate lesson on each chakra and the underlying causes of illness and dis-ease, exercises on how to activate each chakra, emotions associated with each chakra and other additional information. You will also learn the symbols that will be most helpful during a reiki session and how to perform distance reiki.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Reiki is best known in the west as a gentle but powerful system of hands on healing. It is a system, which can easily be learned by anyone to heal themselves, others, plants and animals.\u00a0<\/p> <p>TO SIGN UP you can either go to my website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Reiki-Attunments.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rainbowreikihealing.com\/Reiki-Attunments.html<\/a>.

But with the mysterious deaths of his father and brother, it seems the new Lord Crane has inherited an earldom. He\u2019s also inherited his family\u2019s enemies. He needs magical assistance, fast. He doesn't expect it to turn up angry.<\/p> <p>Magician Stephen Day has good reason to hate Crane\u2019s family. Unfortunately, it\u2019s his job to deal with supernatural threats. Besides, the earl is unlike any aristocrat he\u2019s ever met, with the tattoos, the attitude... and the way Crane seems determined to get him into bed. That\u2019s definitely unusual.<\/p> <p>Soon Stephen is falling hard for the worst possible man, at the worst possible time. But Crane\u2019s dangerous appeal isn't the only thing rendering Stephen powerless. Evil pervades the house, a web of plots is closing round Crane, and if Stephen can\u2019t find a way through it\u2014they\u2019re both going to die.<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>Watch Felicia Day lead online discussion on the Vaginal Fantasy\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fpIcnNlD0uw\">youtube page<\/a>, or follow the group on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/62938-vaginal-fantasy-book-club\">goodreads<\/a>\u00a0page!<\/p> <p>If you're new to the group, don't be afraid to attend the meetup.

Celebrating their 36th\u00a0year touring internationally, Footworks takes you on a journey that conveys the roots and branches of American music and dance, integrating live music, song, and dance to illuminate connections between cultures. Founding Director Eileen Carson received the 2014 Maryland State Arts Council (MSAC) Individual Artist Award for Choreography, and Musical Director Mark Schatz received the 2015 MSAC Individual Artist Award for Composition. With a dazzling and diverse array of traditional and original music and choreography, Footworks\u2019 performances reach all ages and backgrounds and \u201cpack as much skill, pizzazz, energy, imagination and artistry as any audience could ask for.\u201d (\u00a0The Washington Post)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Footworks is delighted to include very special guest artists for this show \u2013 The Claire Lynch Band and Teelin Irish Dance Company.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The\u00a0Claire Lynch Band\u00a0delivers a personable, high-energy performance including tender country ballads, hard driving bluegrass, and swing with a band of some of the best acoustic instrumentalists in the country. Grammy nominee and IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year Claire Lynch\u2019s soulful songs have been recorded by Patty Loveless and Kathy Mattea and others. Dolly Parton credits Claire with \"one of the sweetest, purest and best lead voices in the music business today.\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Teelin Irish Dance Company\u2019s\u00a0innovative style fuses traditional Irish step dance with contemporary dance, and is the reason that their Director, Maureen Berry, won the 2009 Individual Artist award for Choreography from the Maryland State Arts Council.\u00a0 Maureen was a principal dancer with Footworks for over ten years and will join Footworks in the creation and performance of new choreography to debut on April 30.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/f\/1\/600_445739377.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at Fado's Pub at 5:30 pm or at MD Hall at 7:15 pm for the show","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People\/events\/227961790\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Footworks Percussive Dance Ensemble at Maryland Hall & Fado Irish Pub","id":"227961790","time":1462051800000,"updated":1462108929000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326056943000,"name":"Second Half Rally - Active FUN!","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":3068792,"urlname":"Second-Half-Rally-Active-Recreation-for-Fun-People","group_lat":39,"who":"Fun People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":45,"headcount":0,"distance":16.9844417572,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459433043000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I need to close this to new RSVP's after 6pm on Friday, 4\/29, to give the restaurant an accurate headcount.

It's ok to come late.<\/p> <p>Live music (piano, violin, flute) and a caller who will teach all the dances. Beginners and first-timers are always welcome!<\/p> <p>This type of dance is a forerunner of American square dance. First published in 1651, some of the dances are referenced in Shakespeare\u2019s works! Maybe you have seen this dancing in the Jane Austen movies. Today - we dance for good exercise and sociable fun! In English country dancing, a dancer and his or her partner dance a series of figures, or moves, with each other and with another couple for a short time. They then repeat the same figures with another couple, and so on. The figures are combined in different ways for each dance. English country dancing is a great way to meet and dance with many people, as you dance not only with your current partner, but with everyone else in your set.<\/p> <p>Wear casual, comfortable clothes, and comfortable, clean soft-soled non-marking shoes to protect the floor. No high heels.<\/p> <p>A free dance lesson\/workshop begins at 6:30 p.m. with dancing continuing from 7 to 10 p.m. No experience is required, and it is not necessary to bring a partner. The dancers are all friendly and welcoming; it's traditional to change partners after every dance. All dances will be taught and called.<br\/>Admission is $10; parking is free. Free snacks, and first-timers receive a \u201cNext Dance Free\u201d coupon.<\/p> <p><br\/>For more dance info, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.contradancers.com\/atds\/.\">www.contradancers.com\/atds\/.<\/a> Directions: Take Route 50 toward Annapolis. Take Exit 24 for Rowe Boulevard\/ Route 70, and take the ramp towards Bestgate Road (away from downtown).(If you are coming from Bowie, or Washington, DC, this is a left turn at the end of the off-ramp, and you will pass under Route 50.) After this, the next stoplight is North Bestgate Road. Turn right. Go for a short distance (past the entrance to St. John Neumann) and turn left on DuBois Road. There will be a sign for the Friends\u2019 Meeting House where you turn. Take DuBois until it ends, and turn left into the gravel parking lot.<\/p> <p>RSVPs are not required, but they are helpful so I know to look for you.<br\/>I will plan to be there about 6:30 or so. At that time, and periodically throughout the evening if you come later, you can meet me in the lobby area. You can also ask the people at the front door collecting money where you can find me. (I'll let them know, but if I am not already on the dance floor, I'm usually in the lobby near the entrance.

The idea was simple: play both guilty pleasures and underground classics you listened to growing up in the 90\u2019s: Salt N Pepa and Nirvana. Ace of Base and Happy Mondays. The Prodigy and Biggie. By its third edition, the party began to sell out the Black Cat back stage in DC and, later, the Cat\u2019s mainstage. In 2009, the party moved to the spacious 9:30 Club, whose sound and light systems are simply incredible, and quickly filled it with a legion of happy revelers, too. It is now the largest and longest running 90's party on the East Coast.

The idea was simple: play both guilty pleasures and underground classics you listened to growing up in the 90\u2019s: Salt N Pepa and Nirvana. Ace of Base and Happy Mondays. The Prodigy and Biggie. By its third edition, the party began to sell out the Black Cat back stage in DC and, later, the Cat\u2019s mainstage. In 2009, the party moved to the spacious 9:30 Club, whose sound and light systems are simply incredible, and quickly filled it with a legion of happy revelers, too. It is now the largest and longest running 90's party on the East Coast. Rather than host No Scrubs weekly or monthly, Eastman and Billion insist on keeping the party occasional and as guilty a pleasure as they want it to be.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're pleased to announce NO SCRUBS is coming to Baltimore Saturday April 30!
