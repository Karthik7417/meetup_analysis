We at Small Planet Institute are focused on what we call \"living democracy,\" which is both a daily personal practice and a requirement of a government that answers to its people.

We're thinking movie screenings, book discussions, trainings, social gatherings. We're creating a \"there\" for community to come together in the most fundamental practice of democracy. Let's ACT! If we can bridge cultural gaps, learn and share, and be inspired by stories of success or struggle, we are practicing the \"living democracy\" that we need to see on our municipal, state and federal levels, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We're currently working on a money-out-of politics field guide, researching and writing a book, hosting events, and organizing for this April's mass action, Democracy Spring.

These include the circulatory system, the respiratory system, the endocrine system, and memory. In the bloodstream, they affect the organs as well.

The Rules Are Simple: Children's Video Games: An adult must be present to supervise their child(ren) at all times Each child must bring their own controller w\/ charger (this is in case it breaks) Other video games can be played, so long as they are rated \"Teen\" or BELOW and all attending parents agree Adult Games: all games played must be family friendly (using no vulgar language or inappropriate gestures)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>NOTE: Remember you are in someone else's home.

To ensure the safety and well being of all who attend, it is important that families having anyone with a food or drink allergy notify the other before getting together. Please bring your own snacks &amp;amp; drinks in a suitable container, especially for children. Families wishing to host over a meal time should state their intention to do so.

We also like to meet up with people who just want to eat, drink, dance, or socialize with music in the background. The exact nature of the jam will depend on who is participating and where it is held, but the goal is to play with minimal discussion and no preparation. Don't expect any level of skill or familiarity, so no covers. This style of play does result in some rough patches. We develop a strange appreciation of these rough spots; however, the goal is to find grooves. We don't mind riding through some mess, but we also try to hold onto those groovy riffs. We shoot for something between the chaotic, dissonant nature of free improvisation and the tedium of practiced music. At the end of the day, it is just supposed to be fun. Nobody should ever tell anyone else they are messing up. But at the same time, everyone should be trying to play in such a way that it is easy for others to work with. This might mean playing simple repetitive patterns with a limited set of tones (or keeping a steady beat on the drums). No theory is necessary, but if you are curious, look into the Circle of Fifths, pentatonic scales, and keys. We like to switch around on the instruments. It is helpful if everyone is willing to play drums for a bit (drumming the whole time can be tiresome). Anyway, hopefully that long description didn't scare you away.

Dictionary.com defines grail as: 1. a cup or chalice that in medieval legend was associated with unusual powers, especially the regeneration of life and, later, Christian purity, and was much sought after by medieval knights: identified with the cup used at the Last Supper and given to Joseph of Arimathea. 2. any greatly desired and sought-after objective; ultimate ideal or reward.

Use cases include ingestion, fast real-time analytics, data movement, disastor recovery in Hadoop, ETL, fast batch, alerts and real-time actions. Apex is a Hadoop-native YARN implementation. It simplifies development and productization of Hadoop applications by reducing time to market. Key features include Enterprise Grade Operability with Fault Tolerance, State Management, Event Processing Guarantees, No Data Loss, High Performance, Linear Scalability. Additionally Apache Apex includes Apache Malhar library of over 400 reusable operators (functions). These include connectors to external systems like message bus, file systems, databases, etc. Apache Apex enables users to run any user defined code natively in Hadoop.<\/p>\n<p>We want to develop a strong community that meets face to face and has a deep influence on big data ecosystem.

LOCS features 60-75 minute workshops\/sessions focusing on various topics impacting our community. The 4th Annual LOCS will be held on Saturday, March 19, 2016. LOCS Collective\u2019s purpose is to address the gross disparities that exist regarding access to community and resources for LBTQ women of color in Boston and surrounding areas. Concurrently, there are few organizations dedicated to providing services solely to LBTQ women of color. Our vision is to create spaces\/platforms for LBTQ identified women of color in Boston and surrounding areas to celebrate our vibrant culture, solidify our community and increase our visibility. We do this by: Developing partnerships with regional and national organizations that serve and support LBTQ identified women of color and streamlining their resources into our communities. Encouraging supportive and respectful discussions within and outside our community. Empowering through activism, education and networking. ALLY PRIDE: In addition to uplifting LBTQ communities of color we also recognize the undeniable necessity to foster genuine and wholesome relationships with our allies, charging ourselves as well as other communities to actively advocate for one another. We encourage community collaboration and development.

My 20+ year's of research into what ails America has led me to publish a book \u201cCulture War Cracked\u201d to broadcast my shocking conclusion that what conservatives know of as the \"Culture War\" is in fact King George's Counter-American Revolution being waged secretly. He established his bulwarks against our Constitution at Fortress Harvard, switched his ammo from black powder to white powder (opium) and his loyalists have been waging a self-funding, perpetual war against our freedoms for hundreds of years. So, clearly I need some face-to-face time to prove myself out, as my thesis must sound like quite a stretch! But seriously, my book proves this out by connecting the dots with details of our history that\u2019ve been hidden from view. I posted the press release at SavingATB.com (short for Saving America the Beautiful). Free PDF download of my 98 page book, Culture War Cracked, at 911BloodTrail.com. Once I get enough interested, I hope to have meetings in and around Boston. I anticipate multiple meet-ups each month since this topic is huge and this election is marching forward. I can imagine holding them in places like Boston, Framingham, Peabody, Burlington, Waltham, Dedham and Quincy. This all depends of interest level though. To peek your interest in the subjects we\u2019ll discuss, I have reverse engineered the Culture War and can shatter both the Establishment Class and the New World Order with relative ease. It just took lots of Googling and plenty of inspiration.

The Secret has also been released as an audio-book and printed book with more than six million copies in print.\n\nThe Secret explains with simplicity the law that is governing all lives, and offers the knowledge of how to create - intentionally and effortlessly - a joyful life.

This isn't to impugn anyone who fits these categories. I feel like these attitudes have a part to play in political discourse. However, I've been finding it harder to find nuanced discussion in both the media, and, sometimes, even, in everyday life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>This Meetup is an attempt to rectify that, find people who are similarly interested, and get together and talk. While I don't imagine this group to be directly activist, if people want to use it to meet others with similar outlooks who are interested in organizing, I think that would be great.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'll admit, I don't have an exact definition of a moderate. Thus, if the title rings true to you, please take the leap and come on down. This group is intended to be non-partisan - Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party members, are all welcome. In my opinion, and my experience, most people are moderates not because they lack passion for their beliefs, or because of any particular ideology, but because they understand many different points of view and respect the nuance and difficulty of dealing with complex issues.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you may have guessed, this is a bit of an experiment, so the shape of the group will most likely change over time. To start, I imagine we'll have a topic and perhaps some reading beforehand so that people can have a general reference point for the discussion (I'm thinking articles, not whole books). But, if people are interested, join, send me a message, and let me know what interests you so that we can figure out a way to make this work.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10881692,"name":"Kevin Schwartz","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/highres_13635351.jpeg","photo_id":13635351,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/member_13635351.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/thumb_13635351.jpeg"}},"members":71,"name":"Moderate Politics Meetup","id":19699778,"state":"MA","urlname":"Moderate-Liberal-Politics-Meetup","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Moderates"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Malden","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457902009000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"game-night","name":"Game Night","id":40126},{"urlkey":"portable-gaming","name":"Portable Gaming","id":612322}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/portable-gaming-of-greater-boston\/","rating":0,"description":"this group will meetup and play games on systems like nintendo 3ds ps vita etc","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":157247142,"name":"matt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/highres_254732932.jpeg","photo_id":254732932,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/member_254732932.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/thumb_254732932.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"portable gaming of greater boston","id":19703514,"state":"MA","urlname":"portable-gaming-of-greater-boston","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.4300003052,"who":"gamers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Watertown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457915661000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"bridal-boot-camp","name":"Bridal Boot Camp","id":16062},{"urlkey":"personal-training","name":"Personal Training","id":18628},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camp","name":"Fitness Boot Camp","id":20087},{"urlkey":"fitness-boot-camps-for-women","name":"Fitness Boot Camps for Women","id":20627},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness-boot-camp","name":"Outdoor Fitness Boot Camp","id":26872},{"urlkey":"body-toning-boot-camp","name":"Body Toning Boot Camp","id":35421},{"urlkey":"fat-loss-boot-camp","name":"Fat Loss Boot Camp","id":35422},{"urlkey":"all-female-kick-boxing-boot-camp","name":"All Female Kick Boxing Boot Camp","id":37989},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness-boot-camp-for-women","name":"Outdoor Fitness Boot Camp for Women","id":67328}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Watertown-Fitness-Boot-Camp\/","rating":5,"description":"Watertown Boot Camp is a place where you will be working out in a positive environment with like minded individuals who want to live happy and healthy lives!

All events are timed, but it is up to each participant to decide whether to casually walk a course, or run it like it was their own personal amazing race.

I started this group to introduce more people to delicious vegan food and how to cook. We'll get together from time to time at my home in Milton to cook a delicious meal together and then eat it. Hopefully, with lots of casual conversation and plenty of opportunities to learn how to make your own delicious food without being intimidated by ingredients you've never heard of. I'll pull together a menu (suggestions welcome) and a cost per person, then buy the ingredients and the group with come over to make and eat great meal together. Everything will be vegan in a very non-threatening, no superiority or hostility environment where you take a break from being a carnivore. Or, if you're already vegetarian or vegan, learn how to cook those dishes that seem a little intimidating. Emphasis is on: good food, learning how to cook, and an enjoyable meal with people open to new things!<\/p>\n<p><b>Please note: this is not a \"healthy food\" club.<\/b> There are lots of people who see vegan food only as a holistic natural lifestyle that is filled with beautiful vegetables and great health. This club isn't for those people. &nbsp;Rather, this club is for people who enjoy eating great food and learning how to make it. &nbsp;Not nibling on celery sticks with almond butter (although that is a really tasty snack!). So, there is no way that any of the food we'll be making and eating can be classified as \"health food\". &nbsp; If you're looking for a way to shed calories from your diet, this is not the group for you. I am not a health food person, not even remotely. But I'm 100% plant fueled. &nbsp; I'm asking people to pay for being in this club and attending suppers, so I don't want there to be any confusion about the type of vegan food this club will be working with. Of course, the health benefits of a plant-based diet are numerous and significant. &nbsp; Additionally, this is not a group to figure out how to be vegan on a budget. This is a group about eating great food and learning how to cook it with some really nice people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A note about \"dues\" -- Meetup isn't free. &nbsp;In order to create a group, it costs ~$15 a month. &nbsp;Therefore, the dues are to recoup my costs in setting up the group. &nbsp;You only need to pay dues if you want to actually attend an actual Vegan Supper Club Meetup. &nbsp;You can be a member and just wait for a meetup that you'd like to attend: then pay your $5 dues at that time. &nbsp;It doesn't cost anything to be a member of the group, but it will cost $5 a year if you want to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;Hope that makes sense!<\/p>\n<p>Costs: there will be a charge to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;The charge will vary by event, and will be clearly described. &nbsp;I anticipate that it will cost $30-$45 per person for each supper: you get a great 3 course meal, learn about vegan food and how to cook it, great conversation and drinks in a fun environment.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/9\/600_447902425.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/highres_447902467.jpeg","photo_id":447902467,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/600_447902467.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/thumb_447902467.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193142247,"name":"John T","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/highres_249958762.jpeg","photo_id":249958762,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/member_249958762.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/thumb_249958762.jpeg"}},"members":72,"name":"Boston Vegan Supper Club","id":19717265,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonVeganSupperClub","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.25,"who":"Supper Club Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"South Weymouth","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458146578000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"makeup","name":"Makeup","id":1481},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"women-beauty","name":"Women & Beauty","id":23642},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"healthy-moms","name":"Healthy Moms","id":26042},{"urlkey":"mind-body-wellness","name":"Mind Body Wellness","id":26120},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"beauty","name":"Beauty","id":63675}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Social-Juniko-Healthy-Women-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"The Social @ Juniko is delighted to provide you with a welcoming, fun and beautiful sanctuary within our boutique fitness facility.

In the 1960s we coordinated a major drive to help chiropractors become legally licensed in over 40 states. In the 1970s we waged very successful campaigns against fluoridation. In the 1980s we pushed through legislative recognition of acupuncture. In the 1990s we lobbied to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act S-784, fought malathion spraying, promoted public education on the dangers of vaccinations, and continued fighting the fluoridation battle. In the 2000s we are working to prevent the Codex attempts to restrict your freedom to take vitamins and minerals and we are currently taking action to defeat the Senator Durbin Bill (S.722) that seeks to restrict DSHEA with his move to require dietary supplement manufacturers to submit Adverse Event Reports, to institute a pre-approval process with the FDA for all dietary supplements that are stimulants, and to re-classify anabolic-steroid dietary supplements as Controlled Substances. The other NHF battles include opposing S.1780, S.1538, H.R. 207 and H.R. 3377 (considered the Son of Durbin bill). We are also supporting health-promoting legislation such as the Access To Medical Treatment Act and a repeal of the Kefauver Amendment of 1962 that gave the FDA expanded authority over drug \u201cefficacy\u201d and thus the ability to play favorites with drug companies. We are fighting alongside other countries against a major health freedom threat, one whose goal is to harmonize vitamin and supplement laws that strictly regulate natural health foods worldwide.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4641316,"name":"Mauricio"},"members":20,"name":"The National Health Federation\/Boston, MA.","id":19740552,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-National-Health-Federation-Boston-MA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Health Freedom Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458602785000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"healing-arts","name":"Healing Arts","id":18823},{"urlkey":"leadership-development","name":"Leadership Development","id":19539},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"business-mastermind","name":"Business Mastermind","id":66029},{"urlkey":"holistic-business-networking","name":"Holistic Business Networking","id":97487},{"urlkey":"holistic-entrepreneurship","name":"Holistic Entrepreneurship","id":99253}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Holistic-Business-Mixers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Holistic Authority Leadership Society's (Boston, MA) social networking group for holistic businesses and heart-driven entrepreneurs.

Bodhi Meditation has taught me to slow down in life and I have found an inner peace when I practice. &nbsp;My instructors, Sharon and Daphne have been truly wonderful, through their kindness and patience in their teachings. &nbsp;I feel I have &nbsp;more balance &nbsp;in my life when I meditate, not to mention greater focus and more energy. &nbsp;I have also witness the healing power of meditation when suffering from different types of physical ailments. &nbsp;Through my practice, I have gained inner wisdom on how to handle every day stress. &nbsp;I would definitely recommend this program, as I have experienced first hand the benefits of such an inspirational practice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Jadine<\/i><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Free Magazines:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/puti.org\/en\/8_Download\/magazines.html\">http:\/\/puti.org\/en\/8_Download\/magazines.htm...<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-71.1100006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":202058723,"name":"Boston Bodhi Meditation"},"members":47,"name":"Boston Bodhi Meditation","id":19750233,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Bodhi-Meditation","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Watertown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458788439000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softball","name":"Softball","id":6574},{"urlkey":"kickball","name":"Kickball","id":8267},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"slow-pitch-softball","name":"Slow Pitch Softball","id":19104},{"urlkey":"coed-soccer","name":"Coed Soccer","id":20557},{"urlkey":"outdoor-soccer","name":"Outdoor Soccer","id":24517},{"urlkey":"coed-kickball","name":"Coed Kickball","id":40940},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-sports-league","name":"Co-Ed Adult Sports League","id":78095},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-softball","name":"Co-Ed Adult Softball","id":83507},{"urlkey":"coed-recreational-sports","name":"Coed Recreational Sports","id":89956},{"urlkey":"co-ed-kickball","name":"Co-Ed Kickball","id":93156},{"urlkey":"adult-softball","name":"Adult Softball","id":102419},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"co-ed-recreational-soccer","name":"Co-ed Recreational soccer","id":494112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HUB-Sports-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"Pick a Day, Pick a Field and join hundreds of teams that will play with the HUB this Spring.

If that's your cup of tea, then knock yourself out.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I want something different.<\/p>\n<p>Being a new mom has opened my eyes to many things. Some are too gross to share here, but one of the main things that I've come to value is . . . TIME.<\/p>\n<p>Holy crap . . . how humbling (and nerve-racking) is the reality of TIME? It's an unstoppable, non-negotiable force that keeps slipping through our fingers. The tighter you grasp at it the more it slips out of your hand.<\/p>\n<p>I am done wasting TIME at random business meetings, listening to the same stories, surrounding myself with empty smiles. I'd rather play toy trains with my toddler for 10 hours than spend 10 minutes at yet another basic business meeting.<\/p>\n<p><b>\"Stop complaining, Jessica, and doing something about it!\"<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yep, that's right. Instead of being the type of naysayer that sits in the stands, pointing my finger and critiquing the archaic networking efforts of others . . .

You might make an awesome first impression with people, but if you're a total jerk, good luck getting new clients (and friends).<\/p>\n<p>There are pros and cons with business groups and chambers today. For me, the cons outweigh the pros. Of the hundreds of people I've met over the years, there were only a handful with whom I truly felt connected. Everyone else became just another superficial connection on LinkedIn or simply forgotten. Sad, but true.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spark! Networkers<\/b> is my reaction. It's my experiment. It's my mission.<\/p>\n<p>Strip away the professional labels. Eliminate the fakeness. Remove boring conversation that barely scratches the surface. Instead, bring passionate business owners together. Ignite an immediate connection. Cultivate healthy and sustainable relationships. Share our real personality, our desires, our fears . . . our humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Is all this possible in just one night of networking? Who's knows? But we're going to find out, regardless. I invite you to join me, and all the other \"outside of the box\" thinkers.<\/p>\n<p>No membership fees.

It could take the form of augmented reality glasses, it could be an app on a phone or tablet, or it could even be ear buds that actively filter the sound around you and change your perception of reality. There are many ways to enhance a person's sensory experience of the world around them, and all of these ways fall under the \"augmented reality\" umbrella.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>At first glance it is similar to Virtual Reality, but actually quite different. VR looks to immerse the user in a completely separate environment from the one they are in, whereas AR, as just described, wants the user to more firmly be rooted in their world. As the technologies mature, it makes sense to have a meetup dedicated solely to augmented\/mixed reality technologies and conversations. Our goal is not to cannibalize the community, but rather to provide another opportunity for enthusiasts to engage with each other, and for tinkerers and startups to show off their demos for feedback.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>This meetup group is open to ANYONE who is interested in Augmented Reality. You don't have to be a developer to join.

Siri kicked off the emergence of voice on October 4th, 2011, followed by Google Voice and later Microsoft's Cortana. Beyond the speaking smartphone, we have also seen the emergence of new, and even more compelling form factors, such Ivee, Martian Watches, Jibo, XOWi, and most recently the Amazon Echo. And perhaps even more exciting is the arrival of platforms, such as api.ai, the Amazon Voice Service, and SoundHound's Houndify, that will make the arrival of Ubiquitous Voice possible. This working group meetup gathers professionals, academics, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the dawning of Ubiquitous Voice.

The successful meetup communities that I've been a part of are very serious about following through on commitments - if you say you're going to come, don't pull out last minute unless absolutely necessary, and if you absolutely can't make it - let the organizer know!

However, many of the workshops here do ask for a registration fee, sometimes $40 or more, to attend that meeting. And that fee is applied with each session you might attend.

I'd personally like to attend these once or twice a month, but those fees add up fast in such cases.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><span>I believe photography is more about a feeling that instills in you after you create something new.

I'd like to take day trips and shoot sunrises or sunsets with other photo nerds. Learn from one another. Help one another. We can share tips that we read about online. Share ideas. Share composition styles. And simply shoot together, learning as we go. I do a lot of online research myself and have plenty of beginner tips. I also just came back from two weeks abroad. And I can tell you, that simply shooting every day as I did is the best experience to learn from. I got more comfortable with my camera in two weeks than I have been in year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this group gathers steam, I envision local day trips in the nice weather to Boston and both shore lines. Sunrise photo gatherings. Sunset gatherings. Street photography. Nature photography. When the weather turns cold, we can move indoors to explore Lightroom\/Photoshop together. (every coffee house has wi-fi now). Process images. Maybe do some portrait work indoors on the cold days (serving each other as practice subjects).

As part of the competition, teams are organized around age-old rivalries \u2014 East vs. West, Blondes vs. Brunettes, City vs. Suburbs \u2014 that inspire fundraising, awareness and action in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.<\/p>\n<p>RivALZ began in the fall of 2005 as Blondes vs. Brunettes\u00ae, a flag football event founded by a group of professional women: Sara Abbott, Andrea Rodgers, Kristyn Noeth, Kate Stukenberg and Meredith Riddle Chastang. The founders of the event have a personal connection to Alzheimer\u2019s and designed the event to drive awareness among a younger audience while raising funds for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Since the inaugural game in Washington, D.C., the event has grown to more than 40 cities, raising more than $5 million and bringing thousands of new supporters to the cause.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, to accommodate nationwide growth, \u201cBlondes vs. Brunettes\u201d grew into \u201cRivALZ,\u201d empowering participants to choose the rivalry around which to organize their teams. The funds raised through RivALZ benefit the care, support and research efforts of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.

I will be hosting *Seminars (To discuss anything and everything related to fitness) *Meet up's: To meet men and women currently in a fitness journey as you *Transformation Breakthrough BootCamps *Fitness Transformation Sessions and So much More! About Me: My name is Diego Murillo. I am a Certified Fitness Trainer and Nutrition Specialist, NPC Men's Physique Competitor, Sergeant in the Army served for 6 years, and owner of Mind Body Coaching Zone. About 3 years ago, I was in a completely different place than I am now, both mentally and lifestyle wise. In fact, I never pictured myself doing what I do now. I was working in a 9-6 job that I did not enjoy. Days used to mesh together, because the routine was so monotnous. The only time I did know what day it was, was when the weekend came around. I would go out, party, drink, and basically lose in a couple of hours the training that I put in throughout the whole week. and the FOOD! oh man I would eat whatever was in my face. The \"See Food\" Diet. I felt like I was not striving for goal or a purpose and hit a low point. After finding out that I was going to be deploying, I decided I needed to get control of my life and I needed to figure out what my purpose would be once I Returned home. I decided that I would no longer keep living the lifestyle I had, leading up to that point, working somewhere I was not happy in, having low energy, disliking the person I saw in the mirror and hiding how I truly felt by disguising myself as the \"Fun, party guy\" So during the experience of deployment, I came across my passion and the mission I wanted to achieve once i returned. My passion became fitness and my Mission was to change my life and the lives of those that might currently be going through the same situation that I once did. I wanted to be in the best shape I could be, feel happy with how I looked , and confident that I am working towards something greater. This is why I put this MEET UP group together. To help, inspire, motivate and push men and woman to be the best that they can be! I hope to see you all in the near future! Best, Diego<\/p>","lon":-71.1600036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201248727,"name":"Diego F.

We also welcome parents and educators interested in early childhood education (e.g. Reggio Emilia) to join the discussion without taking a part in the day care.
