It's true. Back in the day, blogging was more or less an online journal that you could either share with other people... or keep private. It's like your starting a conversation with your reader. You write, and they comment. Today, blogging platforms are more or less personal or business websites with the social aspect still available to actively engage with readers. You can use blogging for many things:<br\/>- Therapy (working through things can be easier to release when we take the time to write them down)<br\/>- Instructional (Help other people by telling them how you do what you do)<br\/>- Make money (Yes it's true, you can earn money from your blog)<\/p> <p>Mostly, I think people using blogging to let their voice be heard. Blogging is easy and everyone that wants to be part of the conversation can have a voice. You can speak without interruption and then wait for a reply. That is one of the greatest things about blogging in my opinion.... speaking without interruption. I feel like very often people don't really listen... they are sort of just waiting for their turn to talk. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest (I love Pinterest) blogging provides us with a soap box to stand on and look for like minded people. Blogging can generate revenue and blogging can also provide your with a forum to provide evidence your expertise. So, I think I'd like to host a meetup at the Parsippany Library to show you how to setup your free blogging account and get your started.<\/p> <p>Here's my intention:<br\/>-1 hour meetup (to start, if you like this we can do it again)<br\/>-We'll go over setting up your free blogging account<br\/>-learn how to create content<br\/>-learn how to modify the appearance<br\/>-learn how to share your blog (or not, your choice)<br\/>(believe me the hour will go very quickly)<\/p> <p>There are two ways we can do this, I can either book the computer room (which only has 12 computers so there's a limit to the number of members that can sign up) OR I can book a regular meeting room that will have wifi and you will all be required to bring your own laptop. (actually I can bring a few spares, but I don't have enough for everyone) When you leave after this meetup, you will have a blog started, with at least one post! Writing is one of the best ways to understand how you think about what you think about. I am always amazed at some of the things that I write when I read them later, sometimes I see how I am blocking my success by the words I use, or by the way I talk about my possibilities... and sometimes I am blown away by my insight and I thinks, \"Wow, did I really write that? That is good!\" HA HA HA HA<\/p> <p>One other thing, I have to pay to book the Library, so I will need to charge a small fee to set this up.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last!

Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

(If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.) The gym is on the 10th fl. &amp; has adjoining bathrooms, lockers, and water fountains.<\/p> <p>We'll hit up McSwiggans (393 2nd Avenue @ 23rd St) later! Don't forget:<\/p> <p>* You must be no more than 5'8\" to play!<\/p> <p>* You must RSVP on the site in order to attend!<\/p> <p>* You will be asked to sign a waiver for 2014 as we're not a litigious group. If you have any problems with the prepay, just shoot one of the organizers an email.<\/p> <p>Here are the basic rules we follow for games: 1. Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court! B-)<\/p> <p>***NOTE***<\/p> <p>In an effort for us to reduce overcrowding and to maintain a more accurate estimate of how many people to expect, please sign up online if you intend to play. There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day. We tried playing with Edward Scissorhands once - it didn't turn out so well.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged\/events\/225793133\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":9900000,"name":"Indoor bball warm up & pickup games","id":"225793133","time":1444510800000,"updated":1444523168000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284011099000,"name":"[New York Co-Ed]  Basketball for the Vertically Challenged","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1703973,"urlname":"Basketball-for-the-vertically-challenged","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"bball shorties"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":42,"headcount":0,"distance":1.25659668446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439258546000,"fee":{"amount":9.25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PICK-UP\u00a0CO-ED SOCCER GAMES @ CHELSEA PARK \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Check our\u00a0Facebook page:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ManhattanInternationalCoedSoccer\">facebook.com\/ManhattanInternationalCoedSoccer<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NO CLEATS OR STUDS ALLOWED<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cR_TuiCA8RM\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cR_TuiCA8RM<\/a><\/p> <p><b>GAME DESCRIPTION:<\/b><\/p> <p>Our games are for all levels and people that prefer to play a non-competitive game of soccer, break a sweat while exercising running up and down the field with the ball and all this happening in a very laid-back and non-judgmental environment.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

Look for our red Meetup Sign.<\/p> <p>Get ready to get happier simply by talking about happiness! The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups. Please note that many people opt NOT to RSVP through Meetup for privacy reasons.<\/i><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"$5 Draft Beers, House Wine, Well Mixed Drink","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socialsinglesatwys\/events\/225473899\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Speeddating Ages 42-55  SOLD OUT FOR WOMEN","id":"225473899","time":1444514400000,"updated":1444526697000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191985284000,"name":"Social Singles Ages 25-50","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":742906,"urlname":"socialsinglesatwys","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":8,"created":1442937882000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Discover the Benefits of Buddhist Meditation with a Real Buddhist Monk\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Have you ever wanted to meditate but don\u2019t know where to start?

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/225536125\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":9000000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Saddhasara!","id":"cltxklytnbnb","time":1444514400000,"updated":1444528383000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"51 W 14th St New York, NY 10011, 3rd floor","name":"2B Studios","lon":-73.995842,"id":16204142,"state":"NY","lat":40.737255,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.934176087379,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442344890000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/d\/5\/600_442027637.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>At this workshop, you\u2019ll:<\/b><\/p> <p>Join other couples for laid-back group discussions and fun games that tackle relationship topics in a casual setting.<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn simple, yet powerful tools to help you stop fighting and create productive, healthy dialogue around the toughest issues in your relationship.<\/p> <p><br\/>Find ways to bring peace, respect and passion back into your relationship<\/p> <p><br\/>Discover win-win solutions for your disagreements and develop a sustainable plan for getting on\u2014and staying on\u2014the same page.<\/p> <p>Best of all?

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

Some of them happen to be single. And a lot of us are always complaining about how we never meet anyone decent to date. Let's get together and do what works when it comes to dating -- meeting people through friends and seeing immediately if there's chemistry.<\/p> <p>Our fantastic EWNYC members will review all the great single friends we know and invite a few of them to join us for an evening of fun. Doesn't matter who they are, there is only one criteria that they need and that's to be completely single. The great thing is that these are people whose 100% awesomeness can be vouched for -- none of us are friends with serial killers, right? It's not mandatory but you should probably be single also, you might make a connection here of your own.<\/p> <p><b>The Rules ...<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to keep the ratio of the sexes somewhat even, we do not want to discourage members from attending if they do not have a friend to come with. For example, if your friends, coworker, gym buddy and lunch mate is busy simply come. Will be your single friend<\/p> <p>There are no age restrictions regarding the friends you can bring. EWNYC has members of all ages and who are we to stand in the way of the blossoming of a May-December romance.<\/p> <p>If you would like to attend you cannot bring a friend you must come alone. Please contact the organizer. We are a friendly group and enjoy the time in this intimate setting.

The Love Show has entertained all audiences, from glitzy nightclub fashionistas to gritty downtown theatergoers and has rocked stages performing from Lebowskifest to The BBC gala. The Love Show was commissioned to perform original choreography for the New York screening of The Antics Roadshow, a new film by Banksy, and has also created original work for Veuve Cliquoit, Dom Perignon, and Vouge Magazine. An active presence on the New York art scene, The Love Show was also awarded a week long residency with Chashama, and recently closed the seventh season of their very popular holiday show, Nutcracker: Rated R, which they also performed in Tokyo. The Love Show also has two other full length productions, Dance Mayhem: A Grindhouse Ballet, (set to re-open in November at Theater for the New City), and SEVERED: The Tragic Loves of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster (premiered to a sold-out house at Highline Ballroom). The New York Post and many other publications have praised The Love Show, and The New York Times sent a reporter to exclusively follow the troupe\u2019s exploits on Bastille Day.<br\/>\u00a0\n<i><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.357lover.com\/\">.357 LOVER<\/a><\/b><\/i> is an arena rock band originally from Denton, TX.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/225807117\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytnbpb","time":1444568400000,"updated":1444580777000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"near the corner of West 178th Street and Cabrini Boulevard","name":"South entrance of the GW bridge sidewalk (north entrance if the south is closed)","lon":0,"id":23880247,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.51427793503,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443817556000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>19 miles on the Palisades Park Long Path <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Trail Details:<\/b> Run from the Manhattan side of the GW bridge to the Park Headquarters and back.

Frequently, however, this openness masks a reluctance to explore the very traditions out of which we ourselves have emerged. In this series Rev. Robb will take a fresh look at the spiritual insightfulness and moral imagination contained in the teaching of Jesus while emphasizing how they may continue to be revelatory in our current context. It is always surprising to look carefully at the actual words of great teachers with whom we have assumed we were fairly familiar and to discover new ways of understanding and fresh insights of which we were unaware.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

This can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting selected and rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian channels\/chakras, or the subtle pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is guided to sensations in the body that can be grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into active strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/225785360\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Sexy Halloween Shoot w\/Neesy & Stephanie - Oct. 11th","id":"225785360","time":1444579200000,"updated":1444599020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"40 Minthorne St","name":"Flagship Brewery ","lon":-74.075485,"id":22845752,"state":"NY","lat":40.637199,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.00736141205,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444156039000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Once again, Caitlin and Megan will be hosting a post Staten Island Half social right after the race.<\/p> <p>Come join the SI natives and enjoy Flagship Brewery's (<a href=\"http:\/\/theflagshipbrewery.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/theflagshipbrewery.com<\/a>) freshly brewed beer in the tasting room!

It included Salad, Cauliflower, Soup, Rice, Roti, 5 Hot dishes, Masala Chai Tea, Dessert, soda, beer, and\/or sangria. Everything looked fresh, smelled great, and tasted delicious. I had a beer-mosa. \u00a0They give you Roti, a large water bottle, and a Tandoori chicken leg to start. The Pakoras were deep fried in chick pea battered. \u00a0These little vegetable fritters were absolutely wonderful. \u00a0The rice was soft.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225739481\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytnbpb","time":1444579200000,"updated":1444591772000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Yonkers","address_1":"379 McLean Avenue","name":"Yonkers Peace Pottery Studio","lon":-73.886742,"id":23521481,"state":"NY","lat":40.910118,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.3349428177,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442594114000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/d\/6\/600_434468918.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come make and paint bowls with us.

Their lively and triumphant performance will take place at the historic Emmanuel Baptist Church, located at 279 Lafayette Avenue, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, from 3pm-5pm. NCJQ is a collaboration made to endure and make a long-lasting impression on its audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Drummer Ulysses Owens and pianist Takeshi Obayashi are co-leaders, yet each of the band members contributes equally as writers and arrangers to the group's soulful rhythms. They lead with the belief that the music is strongest when the range of talents among the group is fulfilled. Bassist Yasushi Nakamura elevates the rhythm section with vivid intensity, whether he is swinging hard or using the bow to evoke an intimate mood. Alto player Tim Green brings supple warmth that conjures up the sounds of Kenny Garrett, Charlie Parker, and Wayne Shorter. Trumpeter Benny Benack III (who, alongside Owens, Wynton Marsalis has named on his list of \u201cinnovators in the new generation of jazz\u201d) asserts a bright tone and witty exuberance throughout, providing a perfect compliment to Green's lyricism.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Back of sanctuary- Ask greeters at door for meetup group area","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Jazz\/events\/225948096\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"New Century Jazz Quintet","id":"225948096","time":1444590000000,"updated":1444601637000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1258483680000,"name":"Brooklyn Jazz\/Experimental Live Music","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1558294,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Jazz","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":17.4346752167,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443650378000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Invitation for all musicians for acoustic jazz jam session in the Hot Club genre.

Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance.

Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play THREE games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

It includes suburban towns such as Montclair, West Orange, Verona, Bloomfield, Nutley, and Belleville, and ends in urban Newark.<\/p> <p>This is the fifth annual LENAPE34 which is a very challenging yet very popular annual event for the FreeWalkers. The walker is faced with about 50% wooded trail and 50% suburban and urban sidewalks and streets. Shorter daylight hours add to the physical and mental challenge.<\/p> <p>There are alternatives for shorter segments. So you may choose to do less but can still walk along with the group. We'll also have the support of two train lines for mass transportation both to and from several points along the way. Since its on a Monday, we'll have the benefit of working with a full weekday schedule for this particular walk - allowing more frequent trains for your convenience. There are also several buses running in the area.<\/p> <p>As always, the walk is free and everyone is invited. Most of this trail is a major segment of the Liberty Water Gap Trail, the 130-mile east-to-west trail across the entire state of New Jersey.

You want to update some packages to their most recent versions possible, but you want your software to run after the upgrades, thus perhaps entailing changes to the versions of other packages. One approach is trial and error, but that quickly ends in frustration. We advocate a reproducibility-based approach in which tools like ptrace, reprozip, pip, and virtual machines combine to enable us to explore version combinations of different packages even on a variety of platforms. Because the space of versions to explore grows exponentially with the number of packages, we have developed a memoizing algorithm that avoids exponential search while guaranteeing an optimum version combination. This is joint work with Christophe Pradal, Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, and Patrick Valduriez.<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<\/b> Dennis Shasha is a professor of computer science at the Courant Institute of New York University and an Associate Director of NYU Wireless. He works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial people on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, resampling statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American, Dr. Dobb's Journal, and the Communications of the ACM. He is a fellow of the ACM and an INRIA International Chair.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/att-nyc-seminars\/events\/225421372\/","yes_rsvp_count":45,"name":"Dennis Shasha, NYU","id":"225421372","time":1444660200000,"updated":1444673971000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442419133000,"name":"AT&T NYC Research Seminar Series","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18937940,"urlname":"att-nyc-seminars","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Nyack","address_1":"78 Main Street (above Turiellos pizza shop)","name":"Soul Flyte","lon":0,"id":23221612,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":23.7479934692,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443647913000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi!

That is a complete sentence. Is she a role model? Probably not. Is she completely human and relatable? Absolutely. Frida Kahlo is an enigmatic art figure whom countless historians have tried to assess albeit not that well. Sometimes you can't label or fit someone smugly and snuggly into a specific convention. Sometimes you have to let grace take over and let the person and art suffice. We know this because we respond so intimately to her body of work - most of which is her. Unlike Pablo Picasso, we can't separate the body of work from the person. A horrific accident that brought about a life lived with disability and many subsequent health problems did not prevent her from engaging with life to the fullest. Her choices were hers to make, to hold close and to live free from judgment.<\/p> <p>The New York Botanical Garden is saluting and promoting the art of Frida Kahlo. We are fortunate to live in a city that can bring her life and home to fruition. NYBG is not only exhibiting her art, they've also recreated her personal garden of her home, Casa Azul, in a style of tribute within the main Conservatory - A World of Plants.<\/p> <p><b>Our Plan:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We are bringing our own lunch to eat at the Picnic Pavilion.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>11:15am -\u00a0<\/b>We meet at the information booth at the center of the main hall at Grand Central Terminal.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226004613\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":14400000,"name":"Impromptu Meetup @ Crotona Park -RSVP BY 3:00 pm.","id":"226004613","time":1444680000000,"updated":1444696349000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1643 Lexington Ave (104Th Street)","name":"El Paso Mexican Restaurant, 1643 Lexington Ave, nr 104th St.","lon":0,"id":23826820,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.47414016724,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436572085000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I thought I had posted this earlier. \u00a0Sorry for the delay.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be sitting in the rear room.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/East-Harlem-Christian-Writers-Group\/events\/225328112\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Bring copies of work for the group to critique.","id":"wrdfjlytnbqb","time":1444681800000,"updated":1444694589000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389585932000,"name":"East Harlem Christian Writers Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":12064382,"urlname":"East-Harlem-Christian-Writers-Group","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Christian Writers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07081","country":"us","city":"Springfield","address_1":"278 Meisel Avenue  ","name":"Meisel Park Springfield ","lon":-74.312477,"id":13980652,"state":"NJ","lat":40.701004,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":24,"headcount":0,"distance":17.2568531036,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438805392000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet up for Drop in Soccer at Meisel Park in Springfield 278 Meisel Avenue - Springfield, NJ 07081.

Utilizing Google\u2019s MapReduce\u00a0and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop allows for scalability,flexibility and fault tolerance. Hadoop is optimized to handle massive quantities\u00a0of data either structured, semi-structured, or unstructured\u2013 meaning.<\/p> <p>Hadoop is perfect for Big Data. As part of the Apache Framework, there is\u00a0a host of Apache compliments such as Hive, Pig and Zookeeper, that further\u00a0extend Hadoop\u2019s applications and usability.<\/p> <p><b> SYLLABUS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Week 1 \u2013 Introduction: MapReduce<\/b><\/p> <p>Overview of Big Data and the Hadoop ecosystem<br\/>The concept of MapReduce<br\/>HDFS \u2013 Hadoop Distributed File System<br\/>MapReduce with Python streaming<\/p> <p><b>Week 2 \u2013 More on MapReduce<\/b><\/p> <p>More on Big Data, the Hadoop ecosystem, and MapReduce.<br\/>Mixed case studies and exercises using MR with Python streaming\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Week 3 \u2013 Hive: A database for Big Data<\/b><\/p> <p>Hive concepts<br\/>HiveQL<br\/>User-defined functions in the Hive language<br\/>User-defined functions in Python (using streaming)<br\/>Advanced topic: Hive queries in Python code\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Week 4 \u2013 Pig: Simplified MapReduce<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Basic concepts<br\/>Pig Latin<br\/>Pig functions and macros<br\/>User-defined functions<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/><b>Week 5 \u2013 Spark<\/b><\/p> <p>Intro to Spark<br\/>Intro to Mahout\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Week 6 \u2013 Project day<\/b><\/p> <p>The Hadoop ecosystem<br\/>Brief intro to Spark<br\/>Brief intro to Mahout<br\/>Case studies\/Final projects<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Data-Science-Academy\/events\/225346617\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Big Data with Hadoop and Spark (6 weeks of Mon\/Wed)","id":"225346617","time":1444690800000,"updated":1444702718000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1382477840000,"name":"NYC Data Science Academy","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10802022,"urlname":"NYC-Data-Science-Academy","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Data Scientists, R Users"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"150 West 46th Street","name":"150 STUDIOS","lon":-73.984283,"id":23655109,"state":"NY","lat":40.757992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.629292488098,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438635612000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>CARNEY ACTING STUDIO\u00a0<\/p> <p>NO Nonsense.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>NO B.S.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>NOTHING Fancy.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>Acting taught in a demystified, no nonsense, straight forward way.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/>A supportive, invigorating environment for both the beginner and the experienced.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p>Personal Branding with Purpose is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand. It's about learning how to live your personal brand by sharing your authentic self and communicating clearly the value you can provide others. Our passions, talents, and impact are unique gifts we can give to the world. By learning how to market these gifts through personal branding, you create not only career and business opportunities but also a greater capacity to make a difference in the lives of others and the planet.<\/p> <p><b>* Doors open at 6:45 PM, workshop starts at 7:00 PM sharp *<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WHAT YOU'LL LEARN\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0An understanding of personal branding- how you can leverage it to create new career and business opportunities as well as scale your impact<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Gain greater clarity about your passions, values, purpose, and career goals that serve as a foundation for an authentic personal brand<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Define your Big Idea - what you stand for - and integrate it with your unique knowledge and experience to communicate your brand value<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Identify your niche, target audience and articulate how you can help solve problems they have<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Assess and strategically build your online identity and presence|Develop strategies for maintaining and adapting your personal brand in a world of constant change<\/p> <p><b>WHO THIS CLASS IS FOR\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Professionals looking to create new career and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0People seeking a new job or looking to make a career shift<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Entrepreneurs wanting to increase their own visibility to grow their businesses<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Creatives and service providers (consultants, coaches, agents, and speakers) wanting to attract new clients and business opportunities<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Students or recent grads looking to build a foundation for their future career path<\/p> <p><b>INSTRUCTOR BIO<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/1311863\/marcossalazarheadshot.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/\">Marcos Salazar<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcossalazar\">@marcossalazar<\/a>)\u00a0is a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">social entrepreneur<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#services\">career + life coach<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcossalazar.com\/consulting\">consultant<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/marcossalazar.com\/#engage\">speaker<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.besocialchange.com\/\">community builder<\/a>.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people.
