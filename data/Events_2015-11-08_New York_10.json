When you RSVP you will be contacted for an approximate start time.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>Be prepared to be interviewed like you are applying for a job, not a modeling position. I am not looking for one time models but models that want to work consistently; that are team players; can collaborate with other models and have traits to work independently.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What I look for in the interview:<\/b> personality, personality, personality! It is imperative that applicants be naturally hospitable! Models must be honest, with a good sense of street smarts and have business sense; be a problem solver and resourceful; have a creative mind; and be a good communicator and responsible. ( RELIABLE with punctuality at the top of the list falls in line with being responsible).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bring a resume if you have. I\u2019m looking for experience in any job or school. Have you ever volunteered for community service, helped organize events, played in a band, or do you have dancing experience, etc..?<\/p> <p><b>What to expect as a model in TheModels\u2019Den:<\/b><\/p> <p>If you think that getting paid $200 for 2-1\/2 hours is what it\u2019s about, Then this job is not for you. You are an independent model with TMD promoting you. You will only succeed if you put all your effort into the events. It means: taking the time to be creative, research and scout venues, contact studios, make reservations, post your events and be in constant contact with members to listen to their suggestions and see if you can produce an event they request.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This takes time and the photographers know it.\u00a0Take shortcuts and it can be clearly seen at the events. That is why I am actively involved with the planning process until the model develops a constant work flow.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In most cases for every hour an event is in length: it takes just a long to plan it and then some.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>STOP!<\/b> If you want to model only and not put the work into it the prep, you best not apply.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TMD offers models<\/b> the opportunity to choose their own hours, pay, location and the type of modeling they want to do. All in the environment they choose. They decide whether to use a hairstylist or use a make-up artist.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TMD offers photographers<\/b> the opportunity to attend an event that is not overcrowded but an event that is well managed with photographers limited to a specific amount ( typically 3) where only one photographer is shooting at one time.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Photographers are not required to provide pictures to models, saving the photographer countless of hours of editing. Editing only because they feel obligated to!<\/p> <p>TMD recognizes that events like these are the photographers safe haven where they can come and practice, experiment, try new techniques or new equipment without having to be committed to anyone. Beginners and pros come for that purpose.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>WHY FREE MODELING IS NOT GOOD For anyone<\/b>:\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>For the photographer -<\/b> Free model means trade for pictures. The problem is that time is money and editing pictures end up costing more money than paying a model.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>For the model - <\/b>waiting for a trade in most cases ends up being a disappointment. The photos are not what they expected and in many cases they just don\u2019t receive pictures.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TRANSPARENCY is important at TMD<\/b> - we value everyones time! We find the best models that can model effectively that show up, are willing to accommodate reasonable requests that permit the photographer to try new approaches that allows the photographer to improve their skills.<\/p> <p>And sometimes the images just don't come out as expected!

The pilot study showed that detailed materials, paced appropriately with proper support, yielded positive results for teachers and students who had never written code before. TeachCode was developed to address the needs of business teachers or others who want to help children learn about code and STEM, but who do not have the skills in technology to develop age appropriate, differentiated curriculum and assessments.<\/p> <p>The TeachCode curriculum is created by educator, software test engineer, and TeachCode founder Dr. Jessica Ingrassellino. Jessica has taught the teach code curriculum in schools to students from sixth through twelfth grades, and she feels strongly that learning to code should be available to both teachers and students for low or no cost.\u00a0<\/p> <p>TeachCode seeks to bring the opportunity to learn code to people in the most underserved communities: people who are consumers of technology, but who might not get to create with or for that technology. Additionally, TeachCode seeks to bring communities together through partnerships between colleges, K-12 schools, and TeachCode, to create a supportive learning environment that inspires students, supports teachers, and encourages lifelong learning for all.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/vantagon.com\/\">Vantagon<\/a>\u00a0is a technology company focused in developing software solutions for collaboration and research.

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.<\/p> <p>Fifteen years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from Star Trek: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.<\/p> <p>Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it .<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Editorial Reviews:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Station-Eleven-Emily-John-Mandel\/dp\/0804172447\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442677471&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=station+eleven\"><i>from Amazon.com<\/i><br\/><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b\/?node=390919011\">An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2014:<\/a> A flight from Russia lands in middle America, its passengers carrying a virus that explodes \u201clike a neutron bomb over the surface of the earth.\u201d In a blink, the world as we know it collapses. \u201cNo more ballgames played under floodlights,\u201d Emily St. John Mandel writes in this smart and sober homage to life\u2019s smaller pleasures, brutally erased by an apocalypse. \u201cNo more trains running under the surface of cities ... No more cities ... No more Internet ... No more avatars.\u201d Survivors become scavengers, roaming the ravaged landscape or clustering in pocket settlements, some of them welcoming, some dangerous. What\u2019s touching about the world of <i>Station Eleven<\/i> is its ode to what survived, in particular the music and plays performed for wasteland communities by a roving Shakespeare troupe, the Traveling Symphony, whose members form a wounded family of sorts. The story shifts deftly between the fraught post-apocalyptic world and, twenty years earlier, just before the apocalypse, the death of a famous actor, which has a rippling effect across the decades. It\u2019s heartbreaking to watch the troupe strive for more than mere survival. At once terrible and tender, dark and hopeful, <i>Station Eleven<\/i> is a tragically beautiful novel that both mourns and mocks the things we cherish. \u2013<i>Neal Thompson<\/i>\u00a0 --This text

Even if you or your guests don't think of yourselves as \"vegan.\")<\/p> <p>We'll be hanging out in the eating area, at least until 9:00 (the store closes at 10). Be aware that as it gets later in the evening, the food bar may run out of the more popular items.<\/p> <p>NOTE: Whole Foods offers durable bowls, but not durable utensils. So **remember to bring utensils for yourself**\u00a0to cut down even more on our trash. You could bring your own water bottle, too.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>One last thing: even though this gathering is more casual than other restaurant outings, we still appreciate if you can keep your RSVP up-to-date.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226428925\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":14400000,"name":"68 Degrees Is Perfect For Tuesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226428925","time":1446588000000,"updated":1446604236000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07090","country":"us","city":"Westfield","address_1":"Lamberts Mill Road.","name":"Tamaques Park","lon":-74.32431,"id":21510052,"state":"NJ","lat":40.6286,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.4592037201,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446426566000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>SLB Boot Camp has taken a little break but is back up and running this week!

Security depends on timely updates and monitoring and even though the stakes for enterprise are high, the necessary maintenance is often overlooked, exposing you and your clients to security breaches. We\u2019ll discuss the context of Drupal security today, common mistakes and oversights when implementing Drupal, easy steps that enterprises can take today in order to reduce risks and give a demo of the Lumturio platform.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bios:<\/b><\/p> <p>Murielle Marie Ungricht, CEO<\/p> <p>Belgium born co-founder Murielle Marie Ungricht is a successful and soulful entrepreneur, mentor, coach, writer and business strategist.

Rather than doing a broad re:Invent recap as we sometimes have in the past, we will be joined by Richard Threlkeld, an Solutions Architect from Amazon, to present and demo the capabilities of their new services. Following the IoT talk we will hear from Simulmedia who has accumulated a significant amount\u00a0of\u00a0leanings\u00a0from the development of their\u00a0ETL pipelines and Redshift based Datawarehouse. If you are interested in the Big Data space, don't miss this opportunity to benefit from their experience. For more on the sessions see below:<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>AWS IoT Services<\/b><\/p> <p>We will have a brief overview of the AWS IoT service and a demo using industry hardware. This scenario will leverage the Shadow functionality of AWS IoT and invoke automated processes based upon the built-in rules engine. Additionally we'll also dive into some of the finer service details such as MQTT, Pub\/Sub architecture and security controls.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Building a Data Warehouse in AWS<\/b><\/p> <p>Hear from Simulmedia's Data Engineering team about how they built out their Data Warehouse using AWS services like Redshift, S3 and EC2. This will be a deep dive into the stack that supports one of the largest collections of TV viewing data in the world. In addition to this, the data team will also explain two of their guiding principles that have made their lives much easier - immutability in ETL pipelines and maintaining state within the Data Warehouse.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Logistics<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Food and beverages will be served.

Salted meats and preserved vegetables are also commonly used to enhance the dish. Sugar is an important ingredient in Shanghai cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Another characteristic is the use of a great variety of seafood. Rice is dominantly served over noodle or other wheat products.<br\/>Shanghai cuisine stresses on using condiments and keeping the original flavors of the materials and has features of being fresh, smooth and crispy. It aims at lightness in flavor, and beautifulness in decoration. The raw materials of Shanghai dishes are well cut, and the colors harmoniously arranged.<br\/>Now, special attention is being paid to low-sugar and low-fat food, a good quantity of vegetables and nutritional values.<br\/>Generally Shanghai cuisine is mellower and slightly sweet in taste. Sweet and sour is a typical Shanghai taste.<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Wu Xi Ribs<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/ngQ93gUmSLfrP2HWjAwG9Q\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Fried Pork Buns<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/svezeV3YmMnvNIct5Jl2Ew\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Braised Fish Belly<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-Gwk0JwyO2Pw\/Ta51jKqv08I\/AAAAAAAAAWk\/l3doIDd0jrE\/s1600\/5.P1011777+-+Copy.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-Gwk0JwyO2Pw\/Ta51jKqv08I\/AAAAAAAAAWk\/l3doIDd0jrE\/s1600\/5.P1011777+-+Copy.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Basil eggplant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/6UghINfpUk-1nVznsJ5CIQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dining Room<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/rLdqUVA1DnLqUTuICU3OkQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>END<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Inside the Restaurant","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/226148508\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Dinner @ 21 Shanghai House (Shanghainese Cuisine)","id":"226148508","time":1446593400000,"updated":1446688166000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.68076229095,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420483385000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Due to low number of turnout recently, I'm trying something new.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/226369999\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytpbfb","time":1446593400000,"updated":1446606178000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 228-6226","address_1":"248 Mercer St (between 3rd St and 4th St)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-74,"id":490856,"state":"NY","lat":40.72,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.14235806465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415805169000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to make comics but you're feeling stuck?

As a member of the Skverers, one of the most insular Hasidic sects in the US, he knows little about the outside world\u2014only that it is to be shunned. His marriage at eighteen is arranged and several children soon follow. Deen\u2019s first transgression\u2014turning on the radio\u2014is small, but his curiosity leads him to the library, and later the Internet. Soon he begins a feverish inquiry into the tenets of his religious beliefs, until, several years later, his faith unravels entirely.<\/p> <p>Now a heretic, he fears being discovered and ostracized from the only world he knows. His relationship with his family at stake, he is forced into a life of deception, and begins a long struggle to hold on to those he loves most: his five children. In All Who Go Do Not Return, Deen bravely traces his harrowing loss of faith, while offering an illuminating look at a highly secretive world.<\/p> <p>Event followed by dessert reception<\/p> <p>About The Author: Shulem Deen is the founding editor of Unpious, an online journal for voices on the Hasidic fringe. His work has appeared in The New Republic, Salon, Tablet Magazine, The Jewish Daily Forward, and elsewhere. He serves as a board member at Footsteps, a New York City-based organization that offers assistance and support to those who have left the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.

a piece that for you evokes the essence of a particular Enneagram type (whatever type you choose).\u00a0 Ideally, you will know the actual type of a principal creator of your piece (presumably, this will be the same type evoked), but if this isn't possible, just focus on the human qualities the a given piece of music evokes for you.<\/p> <p>You shouldn't tell the group what type you have in mind - we'll just play the pieces contributed, and have a group discussion about how they strike all of us.<\/p> <p>Of course, if you can't think of a piece to contribute, you are still welcome to attend, but if as many people as possible pitch in, it would help make for an interesting meeting.\u00a0 There is no \"right answer\" - we're just looking for an example of a piece that means something human to you, in a type-identifiable way.\u00a0 If you can think of many examples, consider picking a historically-important piece of music - one that's likely to mean something to others in the group.<\/p> <p><i>Please pick a short piece of music <\/i>- say, around three minutes - or, if you are drawn to longer pieces - try to identify a 2-3 minute important segment we can excerpt.\u00a0 You can identify more than one piece if you like -we'll arrange as time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Advance Submission Requested<\/b><\/p> <p>Given that we might receive a pretty wide variety of types\/genres, I think it would be helpful to arrange the contributed pieces thematically, rather than jumping all over the place - i.e., from classical, to rock'n'roll, to hip-hop (or, whatever) and back again.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, if you could please email me with one (or perhaps two or three) pieces at least a bit ahead of the meeting - say <i>by Monday, November 2, at noon<\/i> - that would be a great help towards preparing something easier and more interesting to listen to than a random jumble.<\/p> <p>You can email me by clicking the \"contact\" button below my picture under \"Organizer\" at left toward the top of the pages associated with our group.\u00a0 A pop-up window should appear.<\/p> <p>(There is no need to tell me what type of you have in mind, either.\u00a0 We'll get to that part later.)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Media for Submitted Pieces<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Last time, we played music using several media - some CD's I prepared, YouTube videos, and pieces on one member's mobile device.\u00a0 I think the YouTube video medium probably worked best.\u00a0 It's a practical way to find a great variety of music (for those not familiar, you can find many, many pieces there).\u00a0 Also, the visuals add something to the group-listening experience - obviously, this is most significant for a singer-songwriter performing his\/her own music.\u00a0 But even for a long-dead classical composer, listening while watching an expressive soloist, group, or conductor can open up a another dimension.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, please <i>email me a YouTube link <\/i>(or two or three), if you can.\u00a0 You can copy and paste the link from another widow in your browser to the Meetup pop-up message-window.\u00a0 If you can't find the piece you want on YouTube, try bringing a CD - or your own device, if nothing else works.\u00a0 I will again have the large tablet-device I used last time, so we can all watch and listen together.<\/p> <p><br\/>Looking forward to see you,<\/p> <p>Nicholas<\/p> <p>(Group Organizer)<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPS - note on schedule - last time, I spoke of possibly moving our monthly meetings to first Mondays -\u00a0 this may still happen, but not until early next year at the earliest.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/enneagram-4\/events\/225743432\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Music Series (pt 2) -

If he fails, he will die. The most recent suitor, the Prince of Persia, is to be executed at the moon\u2019s rising. Among the onlookers are the slave girl Li\u00f9, her aged master, and the young Cal\u00e0f, who recognizes the old man as his long lost father, Timur, vanquished King of Tartary. When Timur reveals that only Li\u00f9 has remained faithful to him, Cal\u00e0f asks why. She replies that once, long ago, Cal\u00e0f smiled at her. The mob cries for blood but greets the rising moon with a sudden fearful silence. When the Prince of Persia is led to his execution, the crowd calls upon the princess to spare him. Turandot appears, and with a contemptuous gesture orders that the execution proceed. As the victim\u2019s death cry is heard from the distance, Cal\u00e0f, transfixed by the beauty of the unattainable princess, strides to the gong that announces a new suitor. Suddenly Turandot\u2019s three ministers, Ping, Pang, and Pong, appear to discourage him. Timur and the tearful Li\u00f9 also beg him not to risk his life (\u201cSignore, ascolta!\u201d). Cal\u00e0f tries to comfort her (\u201cNon piangere, Li\u00f9\u201d) but then strikes the gong and calls Turandot\u2019s name.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/9\/600_434702057.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Act II\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Inside the palace, Ping, Pang, and Pong lament Turandot\u2019s bloody reign, praying that love will conquer her heart and restore peace. The three let their thoughts wander to their peaceful country homes (Trio: \u201cHo una casa nell\u2019Honan\u201d), but the noise of the people gathering to hear Turandot question the new challenger calls them back to reality.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/f\/600_434702079.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The old emperor asks Cal\u00e0f to reconsider, but he will not be dissuaded. Turandot enters and describes how her beautiful ancestor, Princess Lou-Ling, was abducted and killed by a conquering prince. In revenge, she has turned against men and determined that none shall ever possess her (\u201cIn questa reggia\u201d). Facing Cal\u00e0f, she poses her first question: What is born each night and dies each dawn? \u201cHope,\u201d Cal\u00e0f answers, correctly. Turandot continues: What flickers red and warm like a flame, yet is not a flame? \u201cBlood,\u201d Cal\u00e0f replies after a moment\u2019s thought. Shaken, Turandot delivers the third riddle: What is like ice but burns? Tense silence prevails until Cal\u00e0f triumphantly cries, \u201cTurandot!\u201d The crowd erupts in joy, and the princess vainly begs her father not to give her to the stranger. Hoping to win her love, Cal\u00e0f offers Turandot a challenge of his own: if she can learn his name by dawn, he will forfeit his life.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/7\/600_434702167.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Act III\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>In the Imperial Gardens, Cal\u00e0f hears a proclamation: on pain of death no one in Peking shall sleep until Turandot learns the stranger\u2019s name. Cal\u00e0f is certain of his victory (\u201cNessun dorma!\u201d), but Ping, Pang, and Pong try to bribe him to leave the city. As the fearful mob threatens him to learn his name, soldiers drag in Li\u00f9 and Timur. Cal\u00e0f tries to convince the crowd that neither of them knows his secret. When Turandot appears, commanding Timur to speak, Li\u00f9 replies that she alone knows the stranger\u2019s identity and will never reveal it. She is tortured but remains silent. Impressed by such fortitude, Turandot asks Li\u00f9\u2019s secret. It is love, she replies. When the soldiers intensify the torture, Li\u00f9 tells Turandot that she, too, will know the joys of love (\u201cTu, che di gel sei cinta\u201d). Then she snatches a dagger and kills herself. The crowd forms a funeral procession and the body is taken away. Turandot remains alone to confront Cal\u00e0f, who impetuously kisses her (Duet: \u201cPrincipessa di morte!\u201d). Knowing emotion for the first time, Turandot weeps (\u201cDel primo pianto\u201d). Cal\u00e0f, now sure of winning her, reveals his identity.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/9\/600_434702089.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Once again before the emperor\u2019s throne, Turandot declares she knows the stranger\u2019s name: it is Love.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/e\/b\/600_434631435.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Tickets<\/b><\/p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metopera.org\">metopera.org<\/a>.\u00a0 Click on calendar.\u00a0 Select November 3's date.\u00a0 Select the Turandot evening performance.\u00a0 Then, select your seat of choice.<b>\u00a0<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>7:00 pm We will meet in the lobby, in front of the gift shop. \u00a0It is located on the right side of the ticket office.\u00a0<\/b><\/i>I will send out my cell phone number via group email the night before the event.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/3\/c\/600_434631516.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We will also meet at intermission on the lower level (parking level) lounge for drinks or tea.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

During this presentation, Ben Sharma will address how a \u201cmanaged\u201d Hadoop data lake can serve as an ideal data acquisition hub for RDARR analytics and reporting. He will address architectural considerations and required capabilities.<\/p> <p><b>Odyssey: A Look at The Evolution of Big Data Ingestion Pipelines\u00a0by Steve Morin, CTO, Nvent Data <\/b><\/p> <p>Get an overview of the maturing Big Data ecosystem as companies move more towards real-time analytics tools that ingest, extract, translate, and then clean up data for analysis. You'll also get a look at a data ingestion pipeline architecture, how it has evolved over time, and its use cases in today's big data landscape.\u200b<\/p> <p><b>Cisco IT's Hadoop Journey by Robert Novak, Big Data Consulting Systems Engineer, Cisco <\/b><\/p> <p>In this talk, you'll get insights into Cisco\u2019s own Hadoop journey and how Cisco implemented a highly agile enterprise Hadoop platform, delivering multiple use cases including ETL migration, content management, smart analytics and compliance.<\/p> <p><b>The Transformational Influence of Big Data in the Global Capital Markets by Paul Cassell, CIO &amp; Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, Pico <\/b><\/p> <p>The business of financial and global capital management is bursting with hundreds of millions of transactions every day. Recent volatility in the financial markets is driving increased message traffic from electronic trading, stretching systems that simply aren\u2019t equipped to handle such volume. With growing financial data sources and data types (such as social media, audio, and video), the need for big data technologies that can store, process and analyze this financial data is more important than ever. Join Paul Cassell, Pico CIO and former U.S. chief information officer for NYSE Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange, along with Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, as they provide details on scalable, cost-effective, best-of-breed big data technologies that you can leverage for financial data management, regulation, risk analytics, and trading analytics. You\u2019ll come away with a better understanding of how you can harvest and leverage this data so that you can stay one step ahead of your competitors.<\/p> <p><b>\u200bSecure Collaboration on Big Data: Locking Down Doesn't Mean Locking Out by Ted Dunning, Committer for Apache Mahout, Drill, &amp; ZooKeeper Projects &amp; Chief Application Architect, MapR <\/b><\/p> <p>Mobile payments, online banking, smart kiosks, etc. are the platforms driving bank growth for the next 20 years. All of them produce gobs of data and all of them provide opportunities for fraudsters to steal. In order to keep up, new kinds of predictive analytical models will have to be built. In order to develop these new kinds of models, we need all hands on deck, both inside and outside of financial institutions. Unfortunately, cooperation on new modeling technologies is very difficult to do without sharing sensitive data in ways that just isn't acceptable.<\/p> <p>I will describe some recently developed techniques that break this logjam.

Back for its tenth season, ice skating rink at Bryant Park is one of NYC's most treasured winter destinations.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/d\/4\/600_206600692.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>The plan is to meet at 6:30 PM inside the rink facility by the lockers.<br\/>(Entrance to the facility is from the 40th street, middle of the block)<br\/>This is where we will change and put ice skates on before proceeding to the ice.<\/p> <p><b>Bring a lock<\/b> - lockers are free, but if you do not have one you'll have to either buy it at the counter ($9) or check in your bag (and pay a $8 or $10 fee). Note - lockers are quite small so if you have a lot of stuff or wear size 13 shoes like me, you may need to use two lockers - so bring two locks.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost:<\/b><br\/>Access to the ice skating rink is free, and so is the use of lockers (you need to bring your lock!).<br\/>However, the ice-skates rental is not free.<br\/>If you have a pair of ice skates, then you won't pay a dime; but if you do not have your own ice-skates, and can't borrow them from a friend\/relative, you'll have to rent them at the facility for $15 for a skating period (you can stay as long as you want 8AM-10PM).<br\/>If you plan on ice skating more than 2 times this season, I suggest you to purchase a pair of ice skates; there are some incredibly cheap skates out there - girls can pick up a pair for as low as $30...<br\/>Just make sure they fit you OK (thigh but not blistering tight), get the cheapest pair, and disregard all selling points salesman will try to put out there...<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Transportation:<\/b><br\/>Getting to the Bryant park is easy.<br\/>Take subway line B,D,F or M to the 42nd Street - Bryan park stop...<br\/>or 7 line to the 5th Ave stop...<br\/>or N, R, Q, 1, 2 or 3 line to the Times Square - 42nd Street stop and walk one Ave block east.<br\/>The entrance to the ice skating rink is from the south side of the park - 40th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues.<\/p> <p><b>What to wear:<\/b><br\/>What usually works best for me is a base layer top (thin, body tight, moisture wick shirt) with a warm sweater on the top, a scarf, a warm hat, and a pair of gloves; everything else stays in the locker - it could be a bit cold at first, but as soon as you start skating you'll start rolling your sleeves up; Again, this is what works for me - you may want to adjust the amount\/type of clothing to best fit your needs.<br\/>Cell phones are not permitted on the ice - if you need to make a call\/send text, you have to step off the ice.<\/p> <p><b>Checking in:<\/b><br\/>When you enter the facility you will be directed to the counter where they will ask you if you have your own skates or if you need to rent a pair, ask you to sign a waiver and give you a bracelet.<br\/>After you get the bracelet, you can proceed to the lockers area.<br\/>There are some snacks\/drinks sold at the facility but the prices are as they usually are in places like this...I recommend bringing a bottle of water\/drink and keeping it in your locker...<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/6\/8\/600_206601352.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities;

Humanity has continued to set these laws into creative motion through thoughts, prayers, motives, intentions, voices, and beliefs.\u00a0These are the right tools. In this book the student will learn how to use them always for the good.<\/p> <p>Human beings are responsible for creating the good, the beautiful, and the true-all of which we desire to experience. But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work.

Do feel strongly about things and have difficulty moving past your feelings? Does it take you days to process and understand what you feel? If you wish you had more emotional control and intelligence and are seeking to have a more even emotional life, this 12-week online group coaching series is for you.<\/p> <p><b>The Details<\/b><br\/>The series will begin Wednesday, October 21st, 2015, at 7:00pm EST. Live video conferences take place every Wednesday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm EST (12 sessions in total) with unlimited Q &amp; A with Pierre on the private Facebook Group Page.<\/p> <p>Session One: Understand human biology and the provenance of your emotions, from the limbic system to the release of hormones, which change your cellular structure. Learn how to manage your emotions: identify what you are feeling and legitimize your perception of pain and suffering.<\/p> <p>Session Two: Learn about the Desire to Give and the Desire to Receive: the two great impulses that create the Tao, Chi or Prana, which permeates the entire Universe. How do you enter into an exchange in a balanced manner, aligned with spiritual laws?<\/p> <p>Session Three: Fear is the result of a perception that the outside world has negative intentions toward us. It has many forms, but its roots are about fragmentation and separation. It is the loss of merger. Learn how to manage your fear and to determine if your fear is real or perceived.<\/p> <p>Session Four: When we feel emotions that trouble us, we tend to judge and repress them, or worse, try to distract and medicate ourselves into a different state of being. Emotional intelligence implies the management of emotions, both good and bad.<\/p> <p>Session Five: Love is the positive force that creates merger and blending. It allows us to overcome the basic untruth of separation in 3-D reality. Addressing self-love a with body image: How do we value ourselves, and what kinds of programs are sabotaging our self-worth and value? A look at your childhood and inner child will heal your unworthiness better than any other tool.<\/p> <p>Session Six: You can only truly love someone to the degree that you love yourself. Giving while being empty will bankrupt your emotional life for you are only giving because you think you are underserving. Sharing your love with others is the most powerful act of blending that you can do: conditional love vs. unconditional love; attachment vs preference.<\/p> <p>Session Seven: We feel positive emotions that tend to uplift and give us good feelings. However, there may be higher emotions for which we understand the dictionary definition but to which we have no actual visceral reaction. Evolve a connection to higher emotions, such as empathy, detachment, and unconditional love.<\/p> <p>Session Eight: Listening is a skill that can be learned. Often we say that we are listening. But we are in fact deep in thought or judging the individual telling the story. To listen is to observe without objections. You have to have a deep level of empathy to be able to do this effectively. Saying the Ho\u2019oponopono helps us become neutral and gives us the tolerance to listen.<\/p> <p>Session Nine: We exist in social settings, and we are interacting with each other in family, social, national, and international situations. Emotions are infectious and can be communicated without verbal clues. This is done through the amygdala in the brain. Individuals who are highly emotionally intelligent can walk into a room and change the mood of the space.<\/p> <p>Session Ten: Neutrality is not disengagement from the injustices of the world. It is a way to engage without being polarized. It is observation without objection. To listen and enhance your social intelligence, you have to listen more effectively, and nothing can increase your listening more than being neutral and observing without objections.<\/p> <p>Session Eleven: Our power to empathize is not limited to sensing other human beings. Given the right kind of consciousness, we can listen to all natural forces for they have a subtle intelligence. It is a kind of intelligence that is heartfelt, and it cannot deceive the forces of nature. They can read your heart and intention. It is a blending of two or more essences.<\/p> <p>Session Twelve: The earth is not an inert mass; rather it is a living organism with a complex series of interconnected processes and systems that balance each other to maintain organic life. Our survival on earth hinges on our assimilation of these processes and supporting the sustainable flow of them. Learn how to listen to the earth.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Find out more!

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.
