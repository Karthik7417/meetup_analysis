Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us. I met some of the most fun and amazing people, the comics were a full top Comedy Central line up too. For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>Host Jonathan Randall brings you Gary Vider (Comedy Central), Chloe Hilliard (NBC), Sam Morril (Conan, Comedy Central), and Seaton Smith (Showtime) and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup.

People are encouraged to share experiences &amp; ideas, network or take off as they like. Feel free to keep writing if you've got the momentum going! Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing. It may just be \"pipe-cleaning\" for now, but you'll feel better showing up at the page. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice.<\/p> <p>WHERE: Argo Tea Cafe, Columbus Circle Subway Station. 1792 Broadway.<\/p> <p>SOME TIPS:<\/p> <p>Argo has plenty of outlets - we will be on the back, large table.<br\/>Seats are hard to come by, and I can only save so many, so please, come on time! If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/229674450\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflyvgbnb","time":1460332800000,"updated":1460426830000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

However, many collections contain an additional type of data: how people use the documents. For example, readers click on articles in a newspaper website, scientists place articles in their personal libraries, and lawmakers vote on a collection of bills. Behavior data is essential both for making predictions about users (such as for a recommendation system) and for understanding how a collection and its users are organized. I will review the basics of topic modeling and describe our recent research on collaborative topic models, models that simultaneously analyze a collection of texts and its corresponding user behavior. We studied collaborative topic models on 80,000 scientists' libraries from Mendeley and 100,000 users' click data from the arXiv. Collaborative topic models enable interpretable recommendation systems, capturing scientists' preferences and pointing them to articles of interest. Further, these models can organize the articles according to the discovered patterns of readership. For example, we can identify articles that are important within a field and articles that transcend disciplinary boundaries.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio: \u00a0<\/b>David Blei is a Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at Columbia University, and a member of the Columbia Data Science Institute.

This week, Alfonso will be talking to us today about the Fable project! Join us!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Alfonso<\/b><\/p> <p>Alfonso has split his career into his two passions, Linguistics and Programming, and still looks for the best way to combine both of them. He\u2019s been fortunate enough to live in different countries and speaks fluently English, Japanese and Spanish (plus a bit of French and German). Feeling at home in .NET ecosystem, he started to explore web programming and really felt the need to use F#, his new favourite language, on the browser. After trying different solutions, he\u2019s developed Fable hoping it\u2019ll help make JS a true backend for F#.<\/p> <p><b>ABSTRACT<\/b><\/p> <p>It may seem the world didn\u2019t need yet another compiler to JS, but Fable brings some new features to the table you should take a look at. With a philosophy similar to TypeScript, the compiled code stays very close to idiomatic JS and adheres to new ES6 standards like modules, classes or iterators, making it easier to interact with other libraries or development tools from the huge JS ecosystem and avoiding any performance penalty. Fable builds on the work of the F# compiler and Babel.js to unlock the full potential of combining two worlds. And of course it lets you take all the advantages of the F# language and compiler we know and love when targeting Node.js or the browser: like static typing, pattern matching, functional standards, terse syntax and great editor support.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Take the Path to Hoboken and we're 2 blocks away on 2nd and River Street.

We will start at 6:30 exactly. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Speaker: Jude Allred, CTO at FogCreek.\u00a0<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Servant leadership is a principle worth fighting for: \u00a0Minimalist management and leadership structures that aim to let the people closest to a problem be its chief decision-makers, \u00a0giving creative workers space and trust to act most effectively, and letting disputes settle through merit instead of politics.\u00a0 It can be straightforward in small teams and small companies, but then you scale and it starts to fall over.<\/p> <p><br\/>This session will tell the stories of servant leadership at Fog Creek Software, tracing through our history of Joel On Software fame and of shipping and helping incubate FogBugz, Stack Overflow, Trello, and our next big thing.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'll deliver specific servant leadership techniques for helping you move your team and company while acting responsibly and putting creative workers first.<\/p> <p>I'll share specific leadership and cultural challenges and how we've overcome them.\u00a0 Expect to come away from this talk with a leadership toolkit that should leave you equipped for:<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Changing company direction and shifting culture from the ground up<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Forming teams and rearranging product efforts<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Incubating new products and building a culture of innovation<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Unbreaking stuck decisions and organizational impasses<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Balancing communication between full consensus, strong decisions from the minds of a few, and decision making as a service.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Keeping teams and individuals connected, especially in a company of remote workers.<\/p> <p>\u00a0- \u00a0Making creative time for queue-driven workers to boost their quality, morale, retention, and scope of responsibility in your company.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Speaker Bio:\u00a0<\/b>Jude Allred is Fog CreekSoftware\u2019s servant leader CTO.\u00a0 For the last eight years, he\u2019s lived the stories of Joel On Software and worked alongside the creative teams who brought us FogBugz, Stack Overflow, Trello, and five other products that we cancelled because\u2026 well, \u00a0spoilers ;-)<\/p> <p>Having come into software enthusiastically modding old video games on a computer of salvaged parts running on generator power in the rainforest of Hawaii, Jude studied Computer Science at CU Boulder and completed a Master\u2019s degree focused on improving computer science pedagogy by incorporating a game development focused curriculum.\u00a0 After a summer of measuring packet loss in mesh networks of winged MAVs, he joined Fog Creekas an intern in 2008.\u00a0 Since then, he\u2019s taken on engineering roles across the organization ranging from FogBugz Developer to Marketing Engineer to DevOps to SaaS Platform Lead to CTO.\u00a0 In each role he\u2019s found new challenges, powerful ways to push on a software company, tremendously inspiring colleagues, and a number of amazingly useful little tricks.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>AFTERWARDS<\/b><\/p> <p>As always, a group of us will hang out afterwards at a bar

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time.

But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Like the novel, which is a mix of experience and theory, the night will be an interweaving of discussion and practice.

However, working with distributed computing is not only pricey, but also requires a large engineering effort and removes interactivity from the data exploration process. In this talk I will demonstrate how to learn powerful nonlinear models on a single machine, even with large data sets. This can be achieved using the partial_fit interface provided by scikit-learn, that implements stochastic updates. Together with stateless transformation of the data, such as hashing, kernel approximation and random projections, these allow incrementally building a model without the need to store all the data in memory, or even on disk.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Andreas Mueller\u00a0<\/b>is an Research Engineer at the NYU Center for Data Science,building open source software for data science. Previously he worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon, developing solutions for computer vision and forecasting problems. He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine learning library, and has co-maintained it for several years.<\/p> <p>His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access to high-quality machine learning algorithms.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Compiled, Auto-Parallel Python with Pyfora (Tom Peters)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Writing performant Python code is hard.

A majority of the event will focus on feedback and your reactions to guide the next stage of the development. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What is FOIA Mapper? <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Government agencies store an enormous amount of data in offline databases, far more than what is available online as open data. And in theory, anyone has the right to access it through a Freedom of Information request. However, the catch is that most government databases are not documented anywhere online, so there is no practical way of knowing what to ask for. The goal of FOIA Mapper is to collect information about these opaque offline databases and organize it into a searchable catalog - basically a search engine for offline government data. &lt; <a href=\"https:\/\/foiamapper.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/foiamapper.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/foiamapper.com<\/a><\/a> &gt;<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Where are we meeting? <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Tuesday, 12 April 2016<br\/>Noon to 2pm<br\/>Civic Hall\u2019s Cafe<br\/>Lunch will be provided, $5.00 suggested donation.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What should you bring?<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>A computing device.

The second part of the class consists of German rhymes, ball games and acrobatics (your child will learn forward and backwards rolls, cartwheels, head and hand stands). We read a story and discuss the words that the children are not familiar with. We gather around the piano and sing together.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

Ignore the note on this page, which says, \"Max: 1 person\". We never max out room capacity. The reason it says it's maxed out, is because I can't sign you up through meetup.com. To RSVP, please send an email to alfred dot vachris at gmail dot com, with your first and last name. Then you will receive an email once a month. A photo ID is mandatory. We plan on meeting on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, but there are changes occasionally. You should receive an email, if there's a cancellation. The Conference Center's security department, requires your first and last name, so please include your full name, within the body of your email. Sometimes, the map on this meetup link above, is incorrect, so please write down the address, (at 41st Street and 8th Avenue, NorthEast corner... i.e. not in Port Authority). If you don't get an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request. I always learn something new at the group, like an advanced feature, or a glitch\/bug to beware of. For example, did you know that formulas entered in the Named Range box calculate as \"Array Entered\". It's OK, to arrive half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient. This event is scheduled for 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM. See link below.

LOL Well this is the event for YOU!<\/p> <p>My local theater has discount Tuesday every week and if you sign up online they will even send you a coupon for the concession stand, each week a different one (this weeks is free small popcorn with a drink purchase). They also have those awesome new reclining seats! And you get to choose and pay for your seat in advance so there is no rushing in at the last minute and sitting in the front row and straining your neck!\u00a0 Here is the link to the theater for more details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.cinemark.com\/theatre-detail.aspx?node_id=83854<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If you purchase tickets online and can\u2019t make it to the theater, just respond to the email address you receive the confirmation email from (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>) and they can refund the payment remotely.<\/p> <p>So here is how it's going to work each week. I will choose a movie when the new schedule goes out (Thur\/Fri) and choose the <b>movie and showtime.<\/b> I will buy my seat online and post what <b>row and number<\/b>. Those of you who wish to join me can buy your seat near me. There are two ways to buy seats: 1) online in advance is your best bet but there is a $1.25 service fee per ticket unless you buy a gift card at the theater and pre-load it. 2) At the theater no service fee but you really need to driver there in advance if you want seats near us.

Using gender equitable evidence-based practices in STEM education, Tech Trek produces a one week long STEM camp hosted by Stockton University where 60 girls live and work on college campus immersed in STEM related fun and challenging activities. We want to inspire, enable and maximize STEM learning and participation for all girls, ultimately encouraging greater interest in STEM careers. This is where you come in. As a STEM professional, you are in a position to make a real difference in girls\u2019 lives by becoming a role model and a sponsor. You can simply volunteer your time or resources or become a mentor. As women become more prevalent in STEM careers, more and more young girls will begin to recognize the additional career opportunities open to them. With more women in the field, it will become more evident to young girls what they can offer the world.<\/p> <p>Michelle will start the program by introducing you to AAUW-NJ\u2019s Tech Trek and the exciting world of technology that lies ahead!

Yet, the rising level of breaches shows that dedicated threat actors will penetrate the organization. Perhaps then the problem is not a technological one, but is rather one of strategy in dealing with cyber-threats?<\/p> <p>In this session, we\u2019ll propose a new defense approach. This strategy assumes that the environment is already compromised and focuses on preventing the real risk to the enterprise: the actual exfiltration and hijacking of data. We\u2019ll show how adopting such a strategy enables organizations to streamline security and align with the business operations as they investigate and remediate a threat.<\/p> <p>This session will discuss:<\/p> <p>New and effective strategies to combat today\u2019s advanced threats;<\/p> <p>Removing the OpEx associated with security solutions;<\/p> <p>Real-life cases of successful enterprises challenging their security status quo.<\/p> <p><b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b><\/p> <p><b>FIDO - Quick Authentication Everywhere<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>A look at how the <a href=\"https:\/\/fidoalliance.org\/\">FIDO\u00a0<\/a>Alliance specifications will allow services to enable strong authentication for their users in a way that finally breaks the barriers that have held back deployments for 2-Factor Authentication.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brianewood\">Brian Wood<\/a>,<\/b> CISSP currently serves as the program manager for Common Criteria and FIPS certifications for <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.samsung.com\">Samsung mobile <\/a><\/b>devices along with representing Samsung in<b> <a href=\"https:\/\/fidoalliance.org\/\">FIDO <\/a><\/b>and Global Platform.

With a philosophy similar to TypeScript, the compiled code stays very close to idiomatic JS and adheres to new ES6 standards like modules, classes or iterators, making it easier to interact with other libraries or development tools from the huge JS ecosystem and avoiding any performance penalty. Fable builds on the work of the F# compiler and Babel.js to unlock the full potential of combining two worlds. And of course it lets you take all the advantages of the F# language and compiler we know and love when targeting Node.js or the browser: like static typing, pattern matching, functional standards, terse syntax and great editor support.<\/p> <p><br\/>BIO<\/p> <p>Alfonso has split his career into his two passions, Linguistics and Programming, and still looks for the best way to combine both of them. He\u2019s been fortunate enough to live in different countries and speaks fluently English, Japanese and Spanish (plus a bit of French and German). Feeling at home in .NET ecosystem, he started to explore web programming and really felt the need to use F#, his new favourite language, on the browser. After trying different solutions, he\u2019s developed Fable hoping it\u2019ll help make JS a true backend for F#.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule:<\/p> <p>6:30 - 7:00\u00a0Pizza\/Socializing<\/p> <p>7:00 - 8:30 Talk<\/p> <p>8:30 - ???

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/228857612\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvgbqb","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460511724000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458331190000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Have you tried shochu?

Players control teams of survivors as they fight off a zombie horde controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies they attract!<\/p> <p>Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue introduces a terrifying new zombie type: the Skinner Zombie! Make sure you put these zombies down hard, otherwise something might come crawling for you! And don't forget Season 3's new big bad is the A-Bomb Abomination! An Abomination so twisted and mutated that its elongated arms can drag you back to it as you try to escape!<\/p> <p>With all these new foes you're going to need to team up if you want to survive!! Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue introduces teams into the Zombicide franchise! Players pick from the largest pool of survivors in a Zombicide game yet and form teams to scavenge, loot, and kill zombies! And if you really want to shred through the shuffling dead, you\u2019ll first need to make sure your team has skills that complement each other well.<\/p> <p>Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue has new zombies, new weapons, new survivors, and even new team mechanics, but the biggest game changer of all is the new optional Player versus Player rule set! Yes, in Rue Morgue players' teams can go toe-to-toe to see which set of Survivors really deserve to survive!

A panel discussion with Andrew Dolkart, Ken Lustbader, and Jay Shockley of the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project will cover the history of the Sip-In, their recent efforts to have the site nominated to the National Register of Historic Places and the historical significance of LGBT Greenwich Village.<\/p> <p><b>Free registration is required <a href=\"http:\/\/salsa4.salsalabs.com\/o\/51405\/p\/salsa\/event\/common\/public\/?event_KEY=5677\">here<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/non-scene-gay-20-somethings-NYC\/events\/229538783\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"The 50th Anniversary of the Sip-In at Julius\u2019","id":"229538783","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460506861000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1264284356000,"name":"The \"Non-Scene\" Gay 20-Somethings of NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1587536,"urlname":"non-scene-gay-20-somethings-NYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"13 East 8th Between 5th and University Place","name":"Some Good Wine","lon":-73.993835,"id":24477883,"state":"NY","lat":40.732716,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.21345448494,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460217999000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you love wine and love socializing join us for this fun evening of mixing, mingling, socializing and tasting some great wine!\u00a0 We will be gathering at The Some Good Wine Shop on east 8th and 5th avenue.\u00a0 They will have a dozen wines mixed for you to sample with someone to explain each one!\u00a0 We will also have a few platters of light appetizers.\u00a0 Maha will be on hand to welcome everyone and introduce you to the others in the group.<\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$30 in advance only - prepay here:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/winemingleatwys.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/winemingleatwys.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/winemingleatwys.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p>Here is how it works:<\/p> <p>-Arrive at 6:30pm and Maha will be there to check you in and introduce you to others from our group.<\/p> <p>-Grab a glass and head to the tasting table for sample of some great wines as explained by the wine shop reps.<\/p> <p>-Take a break and socialize around the appetizer table (cheese, crackers, veggies, etc)<\/p> <p>-Following the wine tasting some of the group may keep the festivities going at a local tavern for more food and drink.<\/p> <p>Cost: $30 includes: the wines and appetizers<\/p> <p>Can I come alone?\u00a0 Yes, 99% of those attending will likely sign up on their own.<\/p> <p>Dress code: Business casual<\/p> <p>What to expect:\u00a0 approx 40 people ages mostly 20's, 30's -40's-50's (you will find plenty of people in your demographic) men and women (singles\/not singles), non wine snobs and a fun and casual atmosphere.<\/p> <p>Non refundable<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socialpros\/events\/230248578\/","yes_rsvp_count":37,"name":"A Casual Night of Socializing & Wine","id":"230248578","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460511828000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1155495135000,"name":"New York Social Professionals Meetup","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":304089,"urlname":"socialpros","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Young Pros"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07070","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Rutherford","address_1":"Station Square","name":"Rutherford Rail Station","lon":-74.101044,"id":13590082,"state":"NJ","lat":40.82827,"repinned":false},"headcount":8,"distance":7.95268392563,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456751642000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a 4 mile run or so through the streets of Rutherford. \u00a0If you want a completely flat run, this run's not for you as there are gradual uphills and downhills throughout the run.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe will run rain or shine, hot or cold.

Participants sit in circle in deep meditation, aligning with the profound healing energy created by the temple, Himalayan bowl sounds and the crystal grid. Suzy creates a crystal grid and calibrates a special frequency with various minerals from all over the world to support deep miracle healing. She accesses the Universal Infinite Field to provide quantum healing to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels of all participants. Folks are required to sign a release form and list any ailments they would like to address during the session. Each participant is guided by assistants to the center of the circle and lays upon the crystal gridded table to receive psychic surgery.\u00a0 Suzy works, as guided and needed by the individual, to trigger the participants internal system into high frequency alignment. This spurs the body to return to health and peaceful well being, as the original root cause has been redirected from the energetic base point. During the entire time Suzy is working on people individually doing hands on healing and making adjustments within the core matrix, as well as holding the temple energies for the Master Teachers; she is using various sound tools,bowls, Peruvian whistles, rattles, as well as using some essential oils and pure sage or palo santo. It is important to understand that participants are not receiving any external energies, but are being triggered or activated to turbo boost and enhance their own energetic field and expanded consciousness.Crystals charged with the Divine Light Healing energy will also be for sale, as well as Suzy\u2019s CDs and book.Pre-registration is required as there is limited room &amp; there is a three day recommended protocol for all Healing Temple participants.

devastatingly effective and versatile combative program that can easily stand alone, or augment your existing practice.\u00a0 The overarching focus is on responding to a threat spontaneously with natural, instinctive movement which strengthens and restores the body, clarifies the mind, and provides a framework for healthy, safe, life-long activity\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the

The problem of course is not having the time to process more than a fraction of the photos He has\u00a0taken.\u00a0 \u00a0Here\u2019s a quote from an art teacher\u00a0he had in college.\u00a0 \u201cArt is long, and life is short, and that is a tragedy of mankind.\u201d\u00a0 Well what the hell, taking photos is a special way of seeing even if most of them are never printed properly organized. And yes,\u00a0He\u00a0is a technical person but many years later he still believes there is magic in those pixels<\/p> <p>Special Announcement: We will be celebrating our 100th anniversary\u00a0this year in 2016 and\u00a0have\u00a0an exhibition planned.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

I will definitely do it again if the opportunity comes around again!\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>To assure personal attention during the critiques, we limit the number of photographers being critiqued to five. Photographers being critiqued will be able to interact with Vickie and get their questions answered.<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cSo interesting to see how cropping can move a photo from good to wow!

Thank you.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>The first five photographers who sign up to be critiqued and pay the $25 fee will be given access to a dropbox. I ask that you put \u00a08-10 photos in the dropbox link we send you. Low res is best, sized at 1200 on the longest side.<\/p> <p>You are welcome to send your best or send your worst. If you shot something recently and it\u00a0didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. Due to time limitations, we probably won\u2019t critiqued all the photos each photographer submits, but we like to have a selection to look at to help you improve. We will make sure those who choose to participate get personal attention.<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cAll, thank you for a great experience and the great suggestions.

For those who do not RSVP and just show up must wait until 5:30pm and depending upon the order you showed up in and if the conditions mentioned above are not met, you will be allowed to play to make it so the teams are 13 each. If you have RSVP-ed and do not show up by the time we kick off and teams are full, you will be put aside. \u00a0for those who show up late, I will set some cones aside so you can play a smaller game against anyone else who shows up late.\u00a0If you don't show up at all and RSVP-ed \"yes\", you will be warned 3 times and after that every time I see your name on RSVP you will be put as a \"no\".

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website?

Your applications don\u2019t need most of the stuff that\u2019s inside those images. I\u2019ll show you how to build really small images, Microcontainers, by starting with nothing and only adding what your application needs to run. Microcontainers contain only the OS libraries and language dependencies required to run an application and the application itself.

Options are great, but we have concluded that the ultimate goal should be a solution that doesn\u2019t require users to have in-depth knowledge about all the things that are available for monitoring and the various methods to get to them. Instead, we\u2019re looking for something that just pulls all the monitoring data out of the containers and Docker daemons with minimal user effort. We like to think of this as \u201ca comprehensive solution\u201d. In this presentation we will cover on what we think goes into this comprehensive solution and how you can use it.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>## Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Hermann Hesse<\/b>, Manager - Sales Engineering<\/p> <p>With 20+ years of building out and managing infrastructure for various organizations small and global, Hermann is now Manager, Sales Engineering east coast for Sumo Logic, where he has helped grow the number of customers from less than ten to over 200.

But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he\u2019s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don\u2019t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johannsson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack\u2019s alpha male Akela. \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.<\/p> <p>About\u00a0IMAX Corporation<\/p> <p>IMAX, an innovator in entertainment technology, combines proprietary software, architecture and equipment to create experiences that take you beyond the edge of your seat to a world you've never imagined.

H2O is an open source distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java; however, fully featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST\/JSON and also through a web interface.<\/p> <p>Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of generalized linear models, gradient boosting machines, random forest, deep neural nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), and anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or \"super learners,\" from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble R package.<\/p> <p>R and Python Jupyter notebooks with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and made available on GitHub for attendees to follow along on their laptops.\u00a0 For those interested in running the code on a multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster, an H2O AMI is also available.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Biography<\/b><\/p> <p>Erin LeDell is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O.\u00a0 She is the author of a handful of machine learning related software packages, including the h2oEnsemble R package for ensemble learning with H2O.\u00a0 Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley.\u00a0 Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group\/events\/229939995\/","yes_rsvp_count":174,"duration":9000000,"name":"Data Science Study Session with H2O @WeWork SOHO","id":"229939995","time":1460586600000,"updated":1460641377000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1418856446000,"name":"New York Data Science Study Group","group_lon":-74,"id":18259733,"urlname":"NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Data Science Padawans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Link will be sent a day before the webinar","name":"Webinar","lon":-73.826897,"id":23735807,"state":"NY","lat":40.8619,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":29,"headcount":0,"distance":11.5357952118,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457286905000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/d\/0\/600_447443504.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a FREE event.

At the same time, the fossil-fuel industry has doubled down, economically and politically, on business as usual. We face an unprecedented situation\u2014a radical situation. As an individual of conscience, how will you respond? In 2010, journalist Wen Stephenson woke up to the true scale and urgency of the catastrophe bearing down on humanity, starting with the poorest and most vulnerable everywhere, and confronted what he calls \u201cthe spiritual crisis at the heart of the climate crisis.\u201d Inspired by others who refused to retreat into various forms of denial and fatalism, he walked away from his career in mainstream media and became an activist, joining those working to build a transformative movement for climate justice in America. In What We\u2019re Fighting for Now Is Each Other, Stephenson tells his own story and offers an up-close, on-the-ground look at some of the remarkable and courageous people\u2014those he calls \u201cnew American radicals\u201d\u2014who have laid everything on the line to build and inspire this fast-growing movement: old-school environmentalists and young climate-justice organizers, frontline community leaders and Texas tar-sands blockaders, Quakers and college students, evangelicals and Occupiers. Most important, Stephenson pushes beyond easy labels to understand who these people really are, what drives them, and what they\u2019re ultimately fighting for. He argues that the movement is less like environmentalism as we know it and more like the great human-rights and social-justice struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from abolitionism to civil rights. It\u2019s a movement for human solidarity. This is a fiercely urgent and profoundly spiritual journey into the climate-justice movement at a critical moment\u2014in search of what climate justice, at this late hour, might yet mean.<\/p> <p>You can procure the book at your local bookstore, library, on the internet, or directly from Beacon Press.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Society-for-Ethical-Culture\/events\/230153467\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Wen Stephenson ","id":"230153467","time":1460586600000,"updated":1460599163000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1238767366000,"name":"Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1425341,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Society-for-Ethical-Culture","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1412 Broadway, Grind, 22nd Floor","name":"Grind, 22nd Floor.","lon":-74.005943,"id":24178403,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457971596000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YSoWGQ\">** CLICK LINK TO ATTEND: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YSoWGQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YSoWGQ<\/a>**<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>As an aspiring product manager, it is essential to build products that users want.

H2O is an open source distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java; however, fully featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST\/JSON and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of generalized linear models, gradient boosting machines, random forest, deep neural nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), and anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or \"super learners,\" from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble R package. R and Python Jupyter notebooks with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and made available on GitHub for attendees to follow along on their laptops. For those interested in running the code on a multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster, an H2O AMI is also available. Biography<\/p> <p>Erin LeDell is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O. She is the author of a handful of machine learning related software packages, including the h2oEnsemble R package for ensemble learning with H2O. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Big-Data-Science\/events\/229995364\/","yes_rsvp_count":80,"duration":9000000,"name":"Data Science Study Session with H2O @ WeWork","id":"229995364","time":1460586600000,"updated":1460597489000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369507378000,"name":"NYC Big Data Science","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8639012,"urlname":"NYC-Big-Data-Science","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"222 Broadway, 21 floor (entrance from Fulton St)","name":"WeWork","lon":-74.007744,"id":24151204,"state":"NY","lat":40.710228,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.90672469139,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458075423000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/c\/0\/600_447886272.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe Startup Station and the New York Startup Law Center, in collaboration with Mobile Week NYC, present:<\/p> <p>LEGAL &amp; BUSINESS ISSUES IN MONETIZING MOBILE APPS<\/p> <p>Welcome: 6:30 pm -7:00 pm<\/p> <p>Monetization Strategies for Mobile Apps - App-Driven Revenue Models; Licensing, JV's &amp; Partnerships; Exit: 7:00 pm -7:40 pm<\/p> <p>Networking: 7:40 pm - 8:00 pm<\/p> <p>Licensing &amp; Partnerships Legal Issues: What to Watch Out For: 8:00 pm - 8:40 pm<\/p> <p>Networking: 8:40 pm -9:00 pm<\/p> <p>WORKSHOPS OUTLINE<\/p> <p>Monetization Strategies for Mobile Apps - App-Driven Revenue Models; Licensing, JV's &amp; Partnerships; Exit, 7:00 pm \u2013 7:40 pm According to Gartner Research, fewer than 1% of mobile apps are successful. Most apps are free and never make any money. 90% of paid apps make less than $1250 per day because no one is downloading them. With statistics against you, what strategies can you employ to succeed? In this discussion, we will cover several monetization strategies for Mobile Apps. Each of these roadmaps determines the app's business model, its marketing objectives and how it should go to market.<\/p> <p>1. App-Driven \"Direct\" Revenue Models<br\/>a) Freemium model (In-App Purchases, Premium features for a fee)<br\/>b) Mobile advertising<br\/>c) Paid Apps<\/p> <p>2. \"Indirect\" Revenue Models<br\/>a) Licensing<br\/>b) Joint Ventures \/ Partnerships<\/p> <p>3.

Licensing &amp; Partnerships Legal Issues: What to Watch Out For: 8:00-8:40 pm 1. The Key Issues to Consider in Intellectual Property Licensing<\/p> <p>1. The owner of the Intellectual Property (\u201cIP\u201d) is entitled to take full advantage of his creation or acquisition. While licensing gives certain benefits to the licensor, it is an effective business model from the licensee\u2019s perspective as well. The licensor should be very careful not to give away the rights that he didn\u2019t intend to or not to expose him to liability because of the actions of the licensees in the course of using his product. We will review the key issues to consider when negotiating a licensing agreement.<\/p> <p>2. Joint Ventures\/Partnerships<\/p> <p>Because partners usually share in the future value of the venture, the nature and structure of their ownership interest as well as their rights and responsibilities should be considered carefully and spelled out precisely. It is important to know that if some matters are not put in writing the law establishes certain default rules for governing such business arrangements, which may not reflect the best interests of the partners but legally bind them. We will review:<\/p> <p>a) Desirable provisions of the partnership agreements<br\/>b) IP rights<br\/>c) Liability matters<br\/>d) Other vital aspects of partnering for profit.<\/p> <p>Presenter: Ekaterina Mouratova, Esq.<\/p> <p>Principal of The Law Firm of Ekaterina Mouratova, PLLC<br\/>Founder of The Startup Law Center<br\/>Author of the book \u201cBusiness Law for Entrepreneurs.

Each of these roadmaps determines the app's business model, its marketing objectives and how it should go to market.<\/p> <p>1.

The Key Issues to Consider in Intellectual Property Licensing<\/p> <p>The owner of the Intellectual Property (\u201cIP\u201d) is entitled to take full advantage of his creation or acquisition. While licensing gives certain benefits to the licensor, it is an effective business model from the licensee\u2019s perspective as well. The licensor should be very careful not to give away the rights that he didn\u2019t intend to or not to expose him to liability because of the actions of the licensees in the course of using his product. We will review the key issues to consider when negotiating a licensing agreement.<\/p> <p>2. Joint Ventures\/Partnerships<\/p> <p>Because partners usually share in the future value of the venture, the nature and structure of their ownership interest as well as their rights and responsibilities should be considered carefully and spelled out precisely. It is important to know that if some matters are not put in writing the law establishes certain default rules for governing such business arrangements, which may not reflect the best interests of the partners but legally bind them. We will review:<\/p> <p>a) Desirable provisions of the partnership agreements<br\/>b) IP rights<br\/>c) Liability matters<br\/>d) Other vital aspects of partnering for profit.<\/p> <p><b>Presenter: Ekaterina Mouratova, Esq.<\/b><\/p> <p>Principal of The Law Firm of Ekaterina Mouratova, PLLC<br\/>Founder of The Startup Law Center<br\/>Author of the book \u201cBusiness Law for Entrepreneurs.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's\u00a0 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.
