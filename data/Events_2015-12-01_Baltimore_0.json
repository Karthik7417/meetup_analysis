Here's the information from the Barnes and Noble web site:<br\/>In this inimitable, beloved classic\u2014graceful, lucid and lyrical\u2014Anne Morrow Lindbergh shares her meditations on youth and age; love and marriage; peace, solitude and contentment as she set them down during a brief vacation by the sea. Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh\u2019s musings on the shape of a woman\u2019s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.<\/p> <p>With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55\/events\/224995255\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Let's Read & Discuss a Book:  A Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh","id":"224995255","time":1446388200000,"updated":1446415224000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422713755000,"name":"Towson Area Inquisitive Women over 55","group_lon":-76.5800018311,"id":18398926,"urlname":"Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55","group_lat":39.4099998474,"who":"Curious women over 55."},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":12.586265564,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421620159000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0Please come out and join us in helping to walk, nurture, and help train a number of rescue dogs that are located at the Tail End Kennel in Reisterstown. \u00a0While this can be a fun and extremely gratifying activity, \u00a0safety is of the utmost importance.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0<b>Due to liability, the management asks that you don't bring children, or your own dogs out to the kennel. \u00a0Thanks for your understanding.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Keira<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/4\/0\/600_415656672.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Watson<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/f\/2\/600_415656082.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Karly<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/f\/6\/600_431743254.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bandit<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/2\/4\/600_431743300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Lucky<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/e\/0\/600_433134240.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Christopher<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/7\/f\/600_433134143.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Twinkie<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/e\/e\/600_436819694.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Chevy<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/c\/f\/600_434851951.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Reds<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/b\/a\/600_439271450.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Gretta<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/e\/f\/600_439271247.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Domino<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/1\/1\/600_439271281.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maryland-Rescue-Dog-Walkers-Group\/events\/225856806\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"Sunday  New Volunteer Orientation and\/or regular dog walker sign up,","id":"vmmwdlytpbcb","time":1446390000000,"updated":1446400686000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330101247000,"name":"Maryland Rescue Animals Care Group","group_lon":-76.7699966431,"id":3357142,"urlname":"Maryland-Rescue-Dog-Walkers-Group","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21093","country":"us","city":"Timonium","phone":"410-828-6116","address_1":"9486 Deereco Rd.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/226119691\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride (MEETING AT THE ICE HOUSE)","id":"rdfpglytpbfb","time":1446589800000,"updated":1446642286000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Catonsville","address_1":"360 Campus Dr","name":"CCBC, Lot 6 Trail Head","lon":-76.737091,"id":24135229,"state":"MD","lat":39.251324,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.82324361801,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444170118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Why the Change of day \/ location: \u00a0<\/b>MORE has been able to broker a deal with DNR to legally allow night riding in Patapsco's Avalon and Glen Artney areas. \u00a0We will be following the rules brokered under this deal for this ride. \u00a0The only thing that will be different to you, our riders, from our standard rides is that anyone coming to this ride will be required to sign the standard MORE waiver. \u00a0The rest will be just like our normal rides.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As there are only so many nights during the week, and a lot of local groups, we will be tag teaming this ride with Aviation Velo for the responsibilities of leading \/ sweeping \/ monitoring the ride. \u00a0I ride with some of these guys pretty regularly and they are good guys. \u00a0In the spring we will go back to our regular Wednesday night rides. \u00a0For now this deal allows us to continue to ride Patapsco legally.<\/p> <p><b>Start Time: \u00a0<\/b>We will meet in the parking lot at 5:45. \u00a0Wheels roll at 6pm sharp.<\/p> <p><b>Ride Description: \u00a0<\/b>This is a casually paced group ride in intermediate and sometimes advanced terrain (i.e. NOT a beginner ride). While casually paced, decent fitness and experience is necessary to have fun on this ride. \u00a0We will expect riders to be able to handle moderately sized logs (i.e. 6\" high) and have experience in Patapsco, during daylight hours, as night riding here is even a tougher experience. Expect leaves covering the trail bed, hidden rocks, damp rock gardens, roots, logs, and stream crossings on this ride. We will periodically stop to regroup, usually at intersections. We expect to ride for 2 to 2 1\/2 hours covering approximately 10 to 15 miles.<\/p> <p>Pace will be around 7 to 8 mph, at night, so be prepared. \u00a0This is a little slower than normal (7.5 to 8.5 during daylight) due to night riding. \u00a0Please also understand pace in Patapsco is usually slower than at Fairland and Rosaryville.<\/p> <p>Night riding in the fall with leaves, damp roots and rocks requires extra care and patience. Please ride within your abilities considering the trail and visibility conditions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What to bring: \u00a0<\/b>Helmets are required without exception. Your bike should be in good working condition and ready to ride. Clear lens riding or safety glasses are highly recommended.

As a child, dad was constantly taking photos of the family, nature and later in life work. I was usually in front of the camera. I never really had an interest in creating images until I began to travel, even though I was an art student in different medias, at Maryland Institute College of Art. I took my first photography workshop in 1997 with John and Barbara Gerlach. I received the suggested list of gear to have in order to maximize the experience and shortly realized I was in over my head. What the heck was a spot meter? So I did some quick research and purchased a Nikon N90S.<br\/>I decided to take the digital leap in 2006, after having the experience of using Nikon's slide scanner and working a little in Photoshop.I bought my first Mac in 2004 and I was ready to take the plunge. I enjoy being behind the viewfinder where every other thought in the world disappears, trying to capture the most beautiful images possible. My articles and images have been published in Nature Photographer Magazine, iPhoneLife Magazine, Maryland Department of Natural Resources Calendar and in the Maryland Wine Association News.<\/p> <p>In 2008 I decided to give the Photo biz a try, with my first Gallery Show. I have subsequently had images displayed in the Rehoboth Art League, and The Seaford Historical Museum; in support of the Smithsonian Museum's traveling show \"Fences\". Currently I have images on display at Baas Art Gallery In Seattle WA. I teach privately, as well as conduct field workshops. I am an instructor at Johns Hopkins University in the Odyssey Program, I lead workshops and lecture for Capital Photography Center in Washington DC. I have lectured at the Mid-Atlantic Photography Expo on Impressionism in Photography; Creative Macro Photography; iPhoneography and in Washington, D.C. during PhotoWeek on the Art of Seeing Creative Compositions and Color Theory.<\/p> <p>You can find me on Facebook too!

If you are interested, come join us to find out more about the operation of a KM group and to determine meeting time and place. The term Kalyani Mitta means \"spiritual friends\". This is a small group of people who meet regularly - typically every two weeks. The purposes of such a group would be a) to help develop more a sense of community, b) to deepen your practice of meditation and encourage more consistent practice, and c) to start integrating Buddhist ideas and principles into your daily life.<\/p> <p>I can't stress enough how beneficial being part of such a group can be. I have witnessed and experienced substantial transformations in myself and in the members of my KM groups as we have wrestled with different Buddhist ideas. And I now have groups of people that I know well and can call on when I need to.<\/p> <p>The structure of a typical KM group is as follows: Silent or guided meditation, followed by a brief check-in of how members are feeling or of significant events, followed by a reading or talk (prepared by the leader of the day) and a discussion of the reading, followed by any announcements and group decisions and a closing. Please know that the KM groups are not a substitution for the Tuesday evening class. This class will continue to run in conjunction with the KM groups. Please know also that joining a KM group is a commitment that you will meet with your group on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>If you have any questions, please contact me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Insight-Meditation-Community-of-Baltimore\/events\/226234584\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"KM Group Organizational Meeting","id":"226234584","time":1446600600000,"updated":1446613331000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434825656000,"name":"Insight Meditation Community of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18686752,"urlname":"Insight-Meditation-Community-of-Baltimore","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Websphere","address_1":"Conference Line","name":"Online","lon":0,"id":19557102,"state":"CA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.4541893005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445662310000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Register by: 10\/30\/15: $10<\/p> <p>After 11\/1\/15: $15<\/p> <p><b>Register at:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplydoitacademy.com\/W5prM\">www.simplydoitacademy.com\/W5prM<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>-----------------------<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/9\/2\/600_282248082.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Do you want to flip<\/b> properties for profit and not just talk about it?<\/p> <p>In this webinar we will cover:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Why should you consider flipping<\/p> <p>\u2022 What prevents us from flipping<\/p> <p>\u2022 Flip-anatomy: what's involved in conducting a flip<\/p> <p>\u2022 Can you flip remotely<\/p> <p>\u2022 Case studies<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Using existing flips systems to maximize success<\/p> <p>\u2022 Smart compensation to increase your returns<\/p> <p>\u2022 Cash, private lending, conventional lending and other methods to participate in a flip<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0About The Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p>Dani Beit-Or has been buying rentals and flips since 2002, NONE locally.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6.

contract, then selling that contract to another investor.<\/p> <p>You don't bring any money to closing,\u00a0you simply walk away with a check.\u00a0 For $5,000... $10,000... even more.\u00a0 And it happens\u00a0fast, typically within 30 days.<\/p> <p>That's why wholesaling is such a great strategy for new investors, as well as pros who like fast cash.<\/p> <p><b>About your instructors<\/b><\/p>

(After two previous attempts that were cancelled due to high winds.) Actually, this is also of renewed interest to some of us after recently visiting Fort Sumter in Charleston, SC! Old forts are very cool. (That's fOrts. FOrts.)<\/b><\/p> <p>Fort Carroll is an abandoned, pre-Civil War era, hexagonal structure that sits on an island in the middle of the Patapsco River. You can see it when driving over the Key Bridge on I-695. The only way you can get to it is by boat. It was built by Robert E Lee. It's named after Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. It's historical. It's cool. And you can't land on it.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/5\/5\/600_437666197.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Fort Carroll<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/c\/3\/600_437666307.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ft Armistead sits on the point of land that is closest to Ft. Carroll. Built in the late 1800's, it was part of the series of forts designed to protect the important Port of Baltimore (Ft Carroll, Ft. Howard and Ft. McHenry were all part of this system.) Speaking of Fort McHenry, (George) Armistead was the commander there during the war of 1812.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/b\/0\/600_437666288.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ft. Armistead is historical, but it's hard to call it \"cool\". It's been abandoned for a long time and no one (read: City of Baltimore) takes care of it. It's totally trashy, the buildings are graffiti-covered (although some very good graffiti), there is drug dealing, and it is a cruising\u00a0mecca. \u00a0So it's a little creepy, but still very interesting.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/0\/3\/600_437666371.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/0\/7\/600_437666375.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Ft. Armistead<\/i><\/p> <p>Here's the plan:<\/p> <p>We'll meet at the Hard Yacht Caf\u00e9 which is on Bear Creek. It's a kayaker-friendly place, with a couple of kayak-specific launching docks.\u00a0The food and drink is pretty good. I mean any place that has what's advertised as a \"Big Ass Steak\" has got to be OK, right? They also have live music on Saturday afternoon and evening.<\/p> <p>The paddle out to Ft. Carroll is only a couple of miles. After hanging out there, we'll head over to Ft Armistead (another mile or so), land on a little beach and walk around to see the buildings where the gun batteries were placed.<\/p> <p>The whole trip is only 7.5 NM but I suspect it will take 4-5 hours after checking out the forts and taking a break.\u00a0 We can add some miles if people want by paddling to either: 1) the abandoned steel mill complex at Sparrow's Point or 2) the industrial\/shipping area around Curtis Bay.<\/p> <p>Even though it's a fairly short paddle, it is pretty serious. There is a lot of boat traffic on the Patapsco, including gigantic freighters. This is the main channel connecting the Chesapeake Bay with the Baltimore Harbor. The boats can generate significant wake and waves. The channel is way more dangerous than Ft. Armistead.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements<\/b><\/p> <p>Therefore: you have to have a 15+ foot boat that is yours and that you know how to handle. It has to have fore and aft bulkheads. You\u00a0have to wear a spray skirt and be totally comfortable doing wet exits. You need to be a strong enough paddler that you can keep up with the group all the time. And you absolutely have to stay with the group when we are doing the crossings.<\/p> <p><b>NOTE: The cold water requirement is in effect!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/8\/9\/3\/600_437666771.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures\/events\/226333351\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":21600000,"name":"Baltimore's Fort Carroll and Fort Armistead","id":"226333351","time":1446908400000,"updated":1447184512000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1320709784000,"name":"Chesapeake Kayak Adventures","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":2775772,"urlname":"Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures","group_lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Chesapeake Paddlers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21113","country":"us","city":"Odenton","address_1":"8274 Telegraph Rd","name":"CardBoard Gaming","lon":-76.694977,"id":15446832,"state":"MD","lat":39.096104,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":14.0140686035,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422581720000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is our normal Saturday DCC Game.

We'll begin by gathering there for a pre-war drink (or two) before walking four blocks over to the tug-of-war zone and the Tugfest street festival. Our mission at Tugfest is to eat, drink, observe, cheer, have a good time, and wander around Eastport soaking up its ambience.<\/p> <p><b>Our SHR group will NOT be tugging in the war!<\/b><\/p> <p>The tugging part is done by organized teams that register and pay a fee to participate.<\/p> <p><b>The Tug-of-War Contest<\/b><\/p> <p>Each year, the MRE professes its independence with a challenge to the City of Annapolis to meet on the high seas of the Gulf of Eastport. The tug-of-war contest is popularly known as \"Slaughter Across the Water\".<\/p> <p><i>Time: \u00a0Crack 'O Noon until 5:00 pm<\/i><\/p> <p>This late-fall rite of passage includes multiple tug competitions held across the Gulf of Eastport (aka Spa Creek). Tug teams represent businesses, service organizations, and anyone else feeling the need to \"tug it out\".<\/p> <p>They're positioned on opposite sides of Spa Creek at City Dock on the Annapolis side and at Second Street and Severn Avenue on the Eastport side. A special tug rope is draped across the water for the teams to grab and pull with all their collective strength. When a marker on the tug rope passes the mid-point of Spa Creek, the match is finished. Nobody gets pulled into the water, although the cheering crowds clearly lust for it.<\/p> <p><b>The Tugfest Street Fair<\/b><\/p> <p>Tugfest is a street festival held right where the tug-of-war participants fight it out on the Eastport side of Spa Creek.

Here is a much better and faster route:<\/p> <p>From Rt. 50\/301 Eastbound, take the Arris T. Allen\/MD 665 exit (exit 22) and stay straight on MD 665. After about a mile, the road name changes to Forest Drive. Keep going on Forest Drive and turn left onto Hilltop Lane.<\/p> <p>Follow Hilltop Lane (which changes name to Tyler Ave.) straight to Bay Ridge Ave. Turn left onto Bay Ridge Ave. and follow it as it turns onto Chesapeake Ave. \u00a0Follow Chesapeake Ave. and turn right on 4th St. to Chester Ave. Davis' Pub is on the corner of 4th and Chester Ave.<\/p> <p>The Eastport neighborhood has several one-way streets, so check the Google map above on the meetup notice to see how to get there.

Now meet the most irresistible and independent heroine of them all, a woman called Low Down, who never had anything good happen to her until the day she asked for the one thing that only a man could give her. . . .<\/i><\/p> <p><i>As scruffy and rootless as the other prospectors searching for gold in the Rockies, Low Down wanted nothing in return for nursing a raggedy bunch through the pox. But when pressed to reveal her heart's wish, she admits, \"I want a baby.\" Not a husband, not a forced marriage to the proud man who drew the scratched marble and became honor bound to marry her. To be sure, Max McCord was easy on the eyes, but he loved another woman and dreamed of a different life. Yet they agreed to a temporary marriage that could end only in disaster. But can this strange twist of fate lead to the silver lining that both have been searching for?<\/i><\/p> <p>Watch Felicia Day lead online discussion on the Vaginal Fantasy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fpIcnNlD0uw\">youtube page<\/a>, or follow the group on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/group\/show\/62938-vaginal-fantasy-book-club\">goodreads<\/a> page!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Carnel-Columbia-Book-Club\/events\/226040145\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"October Meetup: Silver Lining","id":"226040145","time":1446915600000,"updated":1446927603000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1407495373000,"name":"Carnal in Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":16261092,"urlname":"Carnel-Columbia-Book-Club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Annapolis","address_1":"300 2nd St","name":"Chart House","lon":-76.481209,"id":23268092,"lat":38.973633,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.1370868683,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446600396000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Eastport vs Annapolis Tug of War!

Sherry creates a safe, well boundaried and playful atmosphere as she shares simple techniques for greater intimacy, pleasure and spiritual opening.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

That\u2019s not to say that we should be able to pick all the pieces on the board and move them all wherever we want them but that if we have a desire to get to the other side of the playing field then we should rightfully feel we have the authority to make that happen.<\/p> <p>Choosing to be deliberate about our thoughts is one of the greatest ways to begin working with this authority. Not to be confused with having an expectation, establishing a sense of expectancy that our desire will come to pass is integral to experience the result of our work.<\/p> <p>Being deliberate about the way we speak to ourselves is a measure of our commitment to the vision of the desired outcome. If we are constantly finding excuses to avoid cultivating the deliberate mentality we want to have how can we ever expect that the God will multiply it beyond our own effort?<\/p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that it takes more effort to get what we desire. It means that we must exert enough effort to truly fashion our thinking to match the desired outcome if we should ever expect that it will happen in our lives. It is not enough to understand, we must know. We must know that our desire is happening and we must be deliberate about the way we speak to ourselves about it so that it is always increasing our faith in, or acceptance, of it. This kind of discipline is one of many that our philosophy demands of us. Not because it is necessary to \u201cmake it work\u201d but because it is ALWAYS working and it is necessary to \u201cwork with it\u201d with specific purpose in mind.<\/p> <p>In religious science we speak of the promise of the \u201cEternality of the Human Soul\u201d. What is this promise? Simply put in the words of Ernest Holmes:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe Believe in the eternality, the immortality, and the continuity of the individual soul, forever and ever expanding.\u201d<\/p> <p>When we look at life in this way we see that time and space is no limiter of the human soul. In fact, if we are an ever evolving emanation of God then we can easily accept that whatever transition we may ever face, even death, can be viewed in an almost unrecognizable blip on our eternal timeline.<\/p> <p>All the sages of all the ages have agreed that the human soul is something that is not a thing at all. It goes on and on and never ends. It is simply the constant variant that is carried over from one transition to the next, whatever they may be.<\/p> <p>While we never claim to know what these transitions are or what lay beyond them, we acknowledge that it is consistent to believe that we continue to expand in consciousness and as such, there is no transition that will ever be the \u201cend\u201d of our soul.<\/p> <p>Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers, Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\u00a0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/7\/4\/600_422410612.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"6175 Sunny Spring, Columbia, MD 21044","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living\/events\/226541500\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":4500000,"name":"Sunday Experience","id":"226541500","time":1446994800000,"updated":1447000927000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412102441000,"name":"Columbia Center for Spiritual Living","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":17316882,"urlname":"Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"740 Route 3","name":"Athletic Performance Inc","lon":-76.663811,"id":11010062,"state":"MD","lat":39.051575,"repinned":false},"headcount":14,"distance":16.6738166809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443372140000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>November 8th at API on the indoor fields from 10am to 2pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Up to 10 teams of 6-8 people, refereed 5v5 soccer with hockey goals.

It is a means of getting information with the use of a physical instrument, such as a forked stick or rods. Though it was most commonly known as a method for finding underground water,\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>dowsing is an effective and easy way to access subtle energies in order to optimize your health, environment and wellbeing. Earth energy researcher, dowser and former NASA engineer, Larry Bohlen, will provide an<br\/>introduction to dowsing with the intention of finding the energy centers of your home and your land. With a little practice you can find the places of greatest balance and harmony beneficial for meditation, contemplation, gardening and family gatherings. The workshop will include practice outdoors at known earth energy sites perfect for beginning and advanced students. Earth energy centers identified by Larry in the Mid-Atlantic region that are comparable to sacred sites in Glastonbury and Sedona will also be discussed. Inspired by the work of Hamish Miller, in The Sun and the Serpent, Larry is exploring and<br\/>mapping the ley lines and arterial earth energy lines of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic seaboard. He considers dowsing to be one of many paths to inner awareness. Larry teaches the art to others and performs earth energy assessments of landscapes and buildings. We hope you can join us as we explore the world of subtle energies that are everywhere within and around us!<\/p> <p>\n\nWorkshop will take place both indoors and outdoors. Walking shoes and clothes for outdoor weather are Recommended. Bring L-shaped dowsing rods if you have them.<\/p> <p><b>To Reserve your seat, Pre-Registration is required For more information or to Register contact: Kim Leinberger at (410)[masked] or email [masked]<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Register clicking the Ticket button","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/andsoitis\/events\/226030100\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"DOWSING ENERGIES OF HEALING & BALANCE IN YOUR HOME AND LAND: Hands On Workshop","id":"226030100","time":1447005600000,"updated":1447014454000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409763879000,"name":"And So It Is....

However, riding weather is not fully predictable so we need to set some expectations for what is \"reasonable.\"<\/p> <p>Weather forecasts more than 4 days ahead of a ride are only a guide to what may come. As the date of the ride gets closer the forecast becomes more accurate but then needs to be read in detail to decide if you will participate. 50% probability of rain looks pretty bad at first glance but what about 50% probability of .1\" ending at 5am on ride day? The day's forecast will continue to show 50% probability and many riders will stay home on a great riding day.<\/p> <p>I generally use 30% probability forecast at the time of the ride as acceptable, especially if the amount is measured in tenths of an inch. Looking at an online weather map set in motion will also tell us if we're going to be in the middle of something ugly or just skirting the edges. If a ride encounters rain, we take whatever steps are necessary to ensure a safe, comfortable ride including delayed start, shelter for a while, modified route or even last minute cancellation in the worst case. With a 30% probability of rain forecast, I have only had 1 of about 15 rides get rained on and that was intermittent.<\/p> <p>[b]I prefer that if you want to participate in a ride, RSVP without consideration for the weather [\/b]but include a note indicating your intent to stay home if it rains. [b]This tells me that there is group interest in the ride and you can update your RSVP anytime. Otherwise, I get the impression that there isn't any interest in the ride and accordingly may never schedule that ride again.[\/b]<\/p> <p>Bottom line, communicate. [b]Let me know what you're thinking and be sure to have an accurate RSVP by ride day since I may ride an hour to the start point only to find myself the only one there.[\/b]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WomenOn2-3\/events\/226599675\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Glen Rock Mill Inn, Glen Rock PA.","id":"226599675","time":1447255800000,"updated":1447297842000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1361744421000,"name":"Women On Two & Three","group_lon":-76.4100036621,"id":7328372,"urlname":"WomenOn2-3","group_lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Lady Riders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"In Nature","address_1":"Outside","name":"www.CharmCityFarms.org","lon":0,"id":23627592,"state":"MD","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.82481098175,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427930690000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/a\/f\/600_435869103.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Forage Report is a weekly email subscription offered to help beginner (and not so beginner) foragers and the plant curious learn the \"when\" of wild edible plants.

The park has excellent facilities and is well-laid out with paved trails, picnic pavilions, open fields, water views, and a visitors center that's modern, clean, and comfortable. Afterward, the Annapolis Smokehouse is a terrific place to enjoy happy hour food and refreshments.<\/p> <p><b>Meetup Spot and Parking<\/b><\/p> <p>Our group will meet at the large gazebo behind the Quiet Waters Park entrance sign. From there we can walk into the park for FREE\u00a0to enjoy its amenities. Ample parking is available just across Hillsmere Drive in the Bay Ridge Shopping Plaza. After our walk, we'll head over to the Annapolis Smokehouse located in the shopping plaza, so you'll be close to your car when we're done.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/6\/3\/600_431479299.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Walking Around Quiet Waters Park<\/b><\/p> <p>This walk is approximately five miles on the paved trails that go around the edge of the park. Most of the trails are framed by impressive large trees and thick woods. Our route will also pass several open areas, the seasonal ice skating pond, a dog park, and some beautiful waterfront facing the South River. There's a nice visitors center mid-route where food and real restrooms are available.<\/p> <p>The pace will be easygoing to enjoy the beauty of the park's natural surroundings while getting a bit of exercise. If you're late, look for us going counter-clockwise (right) around the park. The entire route is basically a big loop with side trails that brings us back to the park entrance. People can go as fast or slow as they want since we'll all end up at the same place afterward. Total time to circle the park and see everything should be about three hours or so.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/c\/4\/600_431432708.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/d\/7\/600_431432727.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/e\/d\/600_431432749.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Afterward at the Annapolis Smokehouse<\/b><\/p> <p>Following the walk, we'll stroll over to the Annapolis Smokehouse for food and refreshments.

The bar area is large and has a nice ambience.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering.

Tim Spangler will discuss Open Source Apache from a 10,000 foot view, to provide a general overview of a variety of Apache features and day-to-day usage. More specifically, Tim will cover a very brief history of web servers and Apache, and then will cover Apache basics, configuration and troubleshooting tips, the basics of rewrite rules and forward proxies, securing your site, and using Apache as a load balancer. The discussion will also briefly cover using openssl to create SSL certificates, and, if time allows, making Apache highly available using keepalived.<\/p> <p><br\/>Bio: Tim Spangler has been professionally working as a systems engineer for nearly 20 years across a wide variety of technologies, and for a broad range of businesses -\u2013 from a small, family run, Internet Service Provider to Fortune 100 corporations. His background includes Linux, Unix, and Windows administration, middleware management, data center design, backup and recovery, engineering high availability solutions, Perl application development, SAN configuration, and more. Through it all, Tim has been heavily focused on web technology in particular, and has run Open Source Apache starting with Version 1.3.1 back in 1998.<\/p> <p><br\/>Tim holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Minors in English and Business from Carroll College (now Carroll University) in Waukesha WI, and is currently working as a Principal Member of Technical Staff with Oracle.<\/p> <p><br\/>local Convention Note:<\/p> <p><br\/>For those interested, BSides Delaware will be taking place on November 13th and 14th.

Modern mindfulness is creating conscious moments in today's crazy world, through the power of our intentions.Our intentions can determine who we become and help us with the manifestation of what we want in our lives. Good or bad, intentions pave the road of our own personal journey of who we are now and who we are capable of becoming.

It is named for the fictional town of Lake Wobegon from the radio series\u00a0A Prairie Home Companion, where, according to Garrison Keillor, \"all the children are above average\". In a similar way, a large majority of people claim to be above average; this phenomenon has been observed among drivers, CEOs, stock market analysts, college students, and state education officials, among others. Experiments and surveys have repeatedly shown that most people believe that they possess attributes that are better or more desirable than average.<\/p> <p>a.\u00a0 \u00a0Surveying drivers, Ole Svenson (1981) found that 80% of respondents rated themselves in the top 30% of all drivers. Asking college students about their popularity, Zuckerman and Jost (2001) showed that most students judged themselves to be \"more popular than average\".<\/p> <p>b.\u00a0 One College Board survey asked 829,000 high school seniors to rate themselves in a number of ways. When asked to rate their own ability to \"get along with others,\" a statistically insignificant number \u2014 less than one percent \u2014 rated themselves as below average. Furthermore,\u00a0sixty percent\u00a0rated themselves in the\u00a0top ten percent, and one-fourth of respondents rated themselves in the top one percent. Some have argued that more <a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/Subjectivity\">subjective<\/a>\u00a0traits like this may be more easily distorted.<\/p> <p>The effect has been found repeatedly by many other studies for other traits, including fairness, virtuosity, luck, and investing ability, to name a few.\u00a0 The effect is similar and may be related to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ingroup_bias\">in group bias<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wishful_thinking\">wishful thinking<\/a>.

In a recent survey, over 70% of respondents classified themselves as \"better than average\" drivers. Overconfidence is most likely after a series of \"successes\" and can lead to excessive risk taking. This is sometimes used to explain why most investors have too little diversification.<\/p> <p><b>The <a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/False_consensus_effect\">False Consensus Effect<\/a>\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p>[\u201cAs everyone knows\u2026\u2019\u00a0 or \u00a0\u201cAs anyone with half a brain would know\u2026\u201d]<\/p> <p>In psychology, the false-consensus effect is a cognitive bias whereby a person tends to overestimate how much other people agree with him or her. There is a tendency for people to assume that their own opinions, beliefs, preferences, values and habits are 'normal' and that others also think the same way that they do. This cognitive bias tends to lead to the perception of a consensus that does not exist, a 'false consensus'. This false consensus is significant because it increases self-esteem. The need to be \"normal\" and fit in with other people is underlined by a desire to conform and be liked by others in a social environment.\u00a0 [<b>Conventional wisdom<\/b>, whereby one thinks something is true because they think \u201ceveryone else\u201d thinks it\u2019s true, probably fits into thi category,]<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/False_consensus_effect\"><a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/False_consensus_effect\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/False_consensus_effect<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Cognitive Bias<\/b><\/p> <p>A cognitive bias is a pattern of deviation in judgement that occurs in particular situations (see also cognitive distortion and the lists of thinking-related topics). Implicit in the concept of a \"pattern of deviation\" is a standard of comparison; this may be judgement of people outside those particular situations, or may be a set of independently verifiable facts. The existence of some of these cognitive biases has been verified empirically in the field of psychology, others are widespread beliefs, and may themselves be a consequence of cognitive bias.<\/p> <p>Cognitive biases are instances of evolved mental behaviour. Some are presumably adaptive, for example, because they lead to more effective actions or enable faster decisions. Others presumably result from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms, or from the misapplication of a mechanism that is adaptive under different circumstances.<\/p> <p>See list below \u2026<\/p> <p><b>Trait Ascription<\/b><\/p> <p>Trait ascription bias is the tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations. This may be because our own internal states are much more observable and available to us than those of others.\u00a0 This attributional bias has an obvious role in the formation and maintenance of stereotypes and prejudice, combined with the negativity effect.<\/p> <p>A similar bias on the group level is called the outgroup homogeneity bias.<\/p> <p><b>List of Cognitive Biases (8 pages just for the listing of the labels)<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/List_of_cognitive_biases\"><a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/List_of_cognitive_biases\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/psychology.wikia.com\/wiki\/List_of_cognitive_biases<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 Decision-making and behavioral biases - Many of these biases are studied for how they affect belief formation and business decisions and scientific research. \u2013 36 items.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 Biases in probability and belief - Many of these biases are often studied for how they affect business and economic decisions and how they affect experimental research - 27 items.<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0 Social biases - Most of these biases are labeled as attributional biases.- 20 items<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0 Memory error\/bias - A cognitive bias that either enhances or impairs the recall of a memory (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory - 43 items.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socrates-cafe-crofton\/events\/226289029\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"SELECT AT MEETING","id":"226289029","time":1447372800000,"updated":1447385087000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1278864410000,"name":"Socrates Caf\u00e9 Crofton","group_lon":-76.6999969482,"id":1673776,"urlname":"socrates-cafe-crofton","group_lat":39.0699996948,"who":"Inquirers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6023921967,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1330013648000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This ASL BRIDGE meetup is every two weeks on Thursday evening from 7 to 9 p.m.<\/p> <p>This meet up will meet at Panera Bread<br\/>8541 Georgia Ave. the corner of Colesville Rd.<br\/>Silver Spring, MD --<\/p> <p><b>Parking &amp; Metro<\/b><br\/>The nearest parking garage:<br\/>Town Square Garage, 801 Ellsworth Dr. (NE) and it is free after 6:00 pm.<\/p> <p>Silver Spring Metro Station - Red line stop at Colesville Rd.<\/p> <p>www.silverspringdowntown.com has a good map of where are Panera Bread and the garage.<\/p> <p><br\/>As Evelyn Leonard is no longer hosting this meetup- this meet up now has<\/p> <p>TWO Co-hosts JOEL\u00a0 (2nd THURS. )\u00a0 &amp; KEVIN (4th THURS) of each month<\/p> <p>I am trying a new format for this meetup:<\/p> <p>This format for the 2nd Thursday ONLY:<\/p> <p>Each session should be divided into two groups.

Done incorrectly, humor can be a disaster. Executed correctly, humor lightens the load, eases the burden and releases tension. There are three basic methods for adding humor to a speech: Tell a canned joke, tell an original joke or simply make a wry observation.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Method #1: Canned Jokes<br\/>The beauty of a canned joke is that it has usually withstood the test of time. For someone just starting to add humor, this is the best technique. By telling an old standby, you can concentrate on timing and delivery \u2013 two of the major keys to being funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery:<\/b> This refers to the way you present a joke. These two ideas may be the most important aspects of humor. As Toastmasters, we know that communication is more than just words. When you deliver a joke, your attitude alone can make or break the punch line.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But you have to get over the idea that you have to be perfect. Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to laugh.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of our newer members served as Toastmaster for the first time. She opened with a joke, stumbling through it. Even though she had to read the joke and even apologized to us ahead of time for her lack of experience, she told the joke with a smile and a wink. We laughed!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Audacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears. Just say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m terrified. I might botch the punch line, I might forget the entire joke; maybe no one will laugh. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway. It will be hard this first time, but easier the next and the next and the next.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The basic keys to adding humor to your speech are:<\/p> <p>relevance, and<\/p> <p>unexpected insight<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s say you were doing a talk about ESPN or sports fanatics or even just sports in general. You might try the following \u201cused\u201d joke:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cA sports-buff showed up at the sold-out football game. He took his seat on the 50-yard line and then gently placed a woman\u2019s coat and an extra ticket on the seat next to him. The spectator behind him asked, \u201cAre you saving that seat for someone?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man said, \u201cNo. It would have been for my wife, but she\u2019s passed on.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d the spectator said. Then he added, \u201cGosh, why didn\u2019t you give that extra ticket to a friend?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The man turned around with a surprised look on his face and said, \u201cAll my friends are at the funeral.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This joke is obviously\u00a0<i>relevant<\/i> to a sports-oriented talk. It sets the theme of the speech and warms up the audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The <i>insight<\/i> is that we sometimes get so wrapped up in our own stuff that we forget about other people. We all do it. This guy just did it bigger and that makes it funny.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Try out this joke (or any other) on several friends. Practice timing the punch line. Try different wording to make it your own. Try out different pacing, pausing in various places for emphasis. Like any other skill, you learn to tell a joke by practicing. Most people who claim they don\u2019t know any jokes are simply saying that they haven\u2019t practiced any.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Most canned jokes are generic and you don\u2019t have to attribute your source. However, if you are relating something specific to a certain comedian, you should give proper credit. Use your best judgment. You may want to say something like, \u201cAs Steve Martin so aptly put it: \u2018The new phone book is here! The new phone book is here!\u2019\u201d But don\u2019t start your joke with \u201cI got this off the Internet...\u201d Just launch into it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Once you become comfortable telling jokes you\u2019ve found from other sources, take your humor up a notch by trying out some original material.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Method #2: New Material<br\/>There is a basic three-point structure you can follow to create your own, original material:<\/p> <p>Come up with a topic,<\/p> <p>Add a premise, and<\/p> <p>Turn it around.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works: First, come up with a topic. For example, if you are a parent, you might want to make a joke about being a father or a mother. Here\u2019s a caveat. If you are a woman, don\u2019t choose the topic of being a father. The audience won\u2019t be able to relate through you.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>\u201cSometimes a witty observation will produce no more<br\/>than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye. That\u2019s enough.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Next, create a premise. Let\u2019s say you are making a joke about being a dad. Your premise might be that it\u2019s hard to be a dad. Or, that having kids makes men a bit stupid. Or weird. Or that having kids is scary.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Comedy trainer Judy Carter uses those four specific words when she is training people to be funny. She calls them \u201cattitude\u201d words. When you are just beginning to experiment with writing your own material, it is best to stick with the basics:<\/p> <p>Algebra homework is hard.<\/p> <p>Skateboarding on the highway is stupid.<\/p> <p>Being a dad is weird.<\/p> <p>Being tall around toddlers is scary.<\/p> <p>The third part is the hard part. You have to bring in the unexpected. For instance, if you are working with \u201cskateboarding on the highway is stupid,\u201d and you were being serious, you might finish with how dangerous it is. For a joke, look for insight. Look for pain.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, let\u2019s look at a concrete example:<\/p> <p><b>Step one:<\/b> Choose a topic. Let\u2019s say you chose \u201cparenting.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step two:<\/b> Choose an attitude. For example, \u201craising kids is hard.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Step three:<\/b> Create a twist. First of all, what is hard about raising kids?<\/p> <p>Maybe your answer is that you have to be more mature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Now, think of a way to twist that around to surprise the audience. Here is how I used this topic to open my speech on traveling.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cTraveling with kids is hard! You gotta be tough, you know?\u00a0<\/p> <p>We just got back from Disney World. We spent all day walking and it was hot and it was like, \u2018I need a drink of water, and \u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 and \u2018I need to go potty.\u2019\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, my six-year old put her hands on her hips and said, \u2018Dad, quit whining.\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Timing and Delivery, Part II.<\/b> Practice makes perfect. Although great material always sounds like it is impromptu, it rarely is. With jokes, more than with anything else, practice is imperative. You have to practice until it sounds as if you are just making it up on the spot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Record your joke delivery and then listen. After a while, you will get a good feel for the pace. You will hear where the pauses work and where they don\u2019t. Along the way, you\u2019ll memorize the joke. It will also stop sounding funny to you. Don\u2019t worry; your audience has never heard it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In my travelogue about Florida, I tell a story about my five-year old.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cKids are wise, aren\u2019t they? My five-year old son played in the sprinklers at the park and on the ride back to our condo, he took off all his clothes. He got out of the car and everyone stared at him as he walked down the street, naked as can be. JoAnn and I were mortified, of course, but he just looked around and said, \u2018Well, at least I\u2019m wearing sun block!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>This story stopped being funny to me a long time ago, but whenever I tell it, everyone guffaws.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>The Rule of Three<\/b><br\/>Three is an inherently funny number. Just make a list of three things. Throw out the last one and replace it with something outlandish. A word, a phrase. A dead fish.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s take the simple topic of sun block and play it out.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cSun block is weird. (notice the attitude word) My wife packs SPF 44. Sun protection factor 44. Do you know what that means? That means that we can stay out in the sun 44 times longer with it on. Where are we going anyway? The Mojave Desert? The Sahara? The planet Mercury?\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Acting Out<\/b><br\/>Take your humor up another notch...act it out. Now take your rant against sun block and play it out even further:\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>\u201cHave you ever noticed that the companies that make sun block make bug repellent too? You have to have both because they make the sun block smell like Pi\u00f1a Coladas. Of course it\u2019s going to attract bugs. They\u2019re like \u2018Yeah baby! It\u2019s cocktail hour!\u2019\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Surviving the Joke<\/b><br\/>If you\u2019ve practiced your jokes and bounced them off the right people ahead of time, you\u2019re sure to get some laughs. Even so, the day will come when the audience just doesn\u2019t get it. There are two ways to deal with the \u201cbomb:\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>One is the \u201csaver.\u201d Powerhouse speaker J.R. Ridinger sometimes gets going so fast and furious that he leaves the audience behind. His favorite saver: \u201cMaybe that one will catch you on the way home.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The other technique is to just keep on keeping on. One of my all-time favorite inspirational speakers once gave a sermon on sex. The funny quotes she told at the beginning left the audience speechless. She handled her choice of material like a true professional, never missing a beat, though I squirmed and turned a bit red.\u00a0<br\/>Listening to this professional also showed me how confidence and audacity can pull off a joke that a less confident person could never get away with.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Method #3: Wry Observations<br\/><i>Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.<\/i> \u2013 Mark Twain\u00a0<\/p> <p>One of the great masters of the witty statements, Mark Twain once said that electric lights were to humor as lightning was to wit. In other words, unlike a joke that has a story-line, natural wit usually comes out as a pointed, wry observation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Use the triple-A method to develop your ability to make witty statements. First, be\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ware, then add\u00a0<b>A<\/b>ttitude and\u00a0<b>A<\/b>llow yourself to grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Be aware<\/b> by understanding that humor comes from understanding shared experiences, especially painful ones. In order to fully cultivate your own sense of humor, you have to stop seeing your life as completely tragic. We all have troubles. Open your eyes and your mind and watch for the irony and the contrast in life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your attitude will help you be funny. Watch any great comedian, male or female. Some are gutsy and loud, some are meek and shy. You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\"<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Finally, allow yourself to be funny. Open your mouth and try. Toastmasters is the perfect place to nurture your inner comic. Occasionally you may tell a stinker. Get over it and try again. Progress only comes with practice in front of real people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You don\u2019t have to elicit a roar of laughter from your audience. Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye.\u00a0<\/p> <p>That\u2019s enough.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember that Toastmasters is a learning organization.

Pace: Approx. 6-8 mph. Good for most average riders, not so much for the true beginners. This is a no-drop ride, we will wait up for everyone at intersections if needed. (Note: We will adjust to the group dynamics, this is not a ride for a fast pace rider sorry).<\/p> <p>Terrain: Ranges from moderate to difficult to more difficult. Some of the trails are fairly smooth, and there are a few steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, and a stream crossing or two, just be advised that the terrain can be very difficult in places.<\/p> <p>Distance: Approx. 25 miles (not sure of exact mileage on route yet). At least half of it is downhill (ha-ha!). We will not follow the route 100% I\u2019ll make a few changes to it.<\/p> <p>Duration: Approx. 3.5-4 hours, depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, wait-ups, mechanicals and\/or number of breaks (we will take at least one 10\u201315 min. break to refill if needed). I suggest having at least 5 hours cleared for riding, we don't want to rush.<\/p> <p>Directions: Depending on where you are coming from, Route 29 (Columbia Pike) it will take you all the way tell it ends right pass Route 70 and that is where you will take a right onto Rogers Ave and you will come to a circle and take the 3rd exit out of the circle which will be Old Frederick Rd and drive down about a miles and take a left onto Daniels Road and following it down tell you get to the parking and the damn will be on your left.<\/p> <p>Bring: Helmet (required), good bet water, food! Spare tube\/patch kit, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Weather: Partly sunny and high of 51* (no ride if it's raining or the trails are too muddy).

This amazing energy continues to increase becoming more and more powerfully healing. Many watch issues that have blocked them for decades disappear in one class. Hearts open and miracles happen! Unlike many techniques All-Love is a direct Initiation and is not passed through the teacher or Guru. The teacher\/facilitator creates a safe supporting environment holding a vibration of your perfection with Source. Connecting our hearts is the first step in connecting to that Source. As we all come together in a group environment, our energies are united and the entire group energy works as one; One heart. That resonance opens the door for you to walk through at will. After an All-Love class you may notice a new ease in living, clarity in your life\u2019s purpose as well as new abilities arising. Sherry will share the Enlightenment Activation during this event. It is an energy blessing you may continue to share with yourself and others. This will be a very experiential event.

Likewise, the integration of scientific and technological rigor with a humorous engaging example appears to be optimal in educational STEM (Science Technology Engineering &amp; Mathematics) outreach. These principles will be illustrated with many funny STEM examples common to our daily lives by a college professor who is also a stand-up comedian. This approach avoids the poor learning outcomes associated flashy demos whose wow factor eclipses the technical fundamentals, and the lack of audience engagement that often results from describing important technological solutions whose science is simply too complex for the layperson.<\/p> <p>BIO<\/p> <p>The world\u2019s only touring comedian with a Ph.D. from M.I.T., Pete has performed internationally as a comedian for over a decade, and taught Georgia Tech Chemical Engineers for over two decades.

One of his National Science Foundation projects examines the use of humor in engineering education.

This year's Lexus Series program chosen by <b>Maestro Jos\u00e9-Luis Novo<\/b> explores friendly relationships between composers Henri B\u00fcsser and Claude Debussy as well as Johannes Brahms and Antonin Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. Debussy entrusted B\u00fcsser to orchestrate the <i>Petite Suite<\/i> which was originally composed for piano four hands and to conduct several early productions of <i>Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande<\/i>. Paradoxically, B\u00fcsser won the first Prix de Rome in the year Debussy won the second.<\/p> <p>Brahms and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k were not only friends, but admirers of each other's talent. Brahms introduced Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to Simrock, the German publisher who would encourage Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to write a violin concerto. He turned to violinist Joseph Joachim, the same violinist that Brahms consulted, for professional advice on the solo part.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Debussy\/B\u00fcsser - <i>Petite Suite <\/i><br\/>Dvo\u0159\u00e1k - Concerto for Violin in A Minor<br\/>Brahms - Symphony No. 3 in F Major<\/b><\/p> <p>Playing Dvo\u0159\u00e1k with the orchestra tonight, Violinist Netanel Draiblate is a rising star in the classical world whose artistry has been praised as \u201cconfident and eloquent.\u201d His recent orchestral appearances as well as his performances as a chamber musician, recording artist, and concertmaster serve to highlight his versatility. This season, Mr. Draiblate\u2019s first solo CD, Perspectives, was released by Azica Records. The recording features works by Mendelssohn, Prokofiev, Elgar, Grieg and Kreisler. Future projects include a recording of his original arrangement of Introduction\/Theme and Variations on The Star Spangled Banner for solo violin.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hailed as \u201can extremely gifted and natural violinist with a strong stage personality and charisma,\u201d Draiblate\u2019s recent solo engagements include his debut with the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie hall, the Israel Chamber Orchestra and orchestras across four continents. He recently also toured China as a soloist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. You may recognize him as frequent Concertmaster for the Annapolis Symphony, although tonight is his first solo appearance. \u00a0Listen to a sampling of his virtuosity here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netaneldraiblate.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.netaneldraiblate.com\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/4\/5\/600_442384677.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>At 6:45 p.m. before each Lexus Classic Series performance, the ASO offers a FREE pre-concert conversation in the Maryland Hall auditorium, designed to enhance and enrich the experience of those attending that evening\u2019s performance.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake.

Does that mean that you should stop everything you are doing and spend all day thinking about the desired outcome and doing nothing? Of course not, that would be silly. What it does mean however is that the more you maintain the consistent thought of what you desire the more authority you lend to it.<\/p> <p>The importance of consistent practice rests in the notion that the more you do something the better you get at it. If what we want is to cultivate a mind that puts Love at the top of every list then we must practice what it means to think, act and live as if that were so.<\/p> <p>If you \u201cthink\u201d you already have a life that is a thinking, acting and living embodiment of what you desire you might want to ask yourself, \u201cThen why is it occurring to me to pray for this desire?\u201d If it were already so\u2026 you probably wouldn\u2019t be praying for it.<\/p> <p>We MUST be consistent and persistent in the way we adopt a New Thought into our lives. Doing so is a reflection of our actual commitment to, and prioritization of, the desire itself. It cannot manifest until we have made it a clear priority in our lives because we have yet to say we are committed to that state of being. That\u2019s why we \u201cpractice\u201d our spirituality. To get better and better at living our desired state of being in everything that we do without having to stop everything we\u2019re doing in order to create that state of being.<\/p> <p>In religious science we speak of the promise of the \u201cEternality of the Human Soul\u201d. What is this promise? Simply put in the words of Ernest Holmes:<\/p> <p>\u201cWe Believe in the eternality, the immortality, and the continuity of the individual soul, forever and ever expanding.\u201d<\/p> <p>When we look at life in this way we see that time and space is no limiter of the human soul. In fact, if we are an ever evolving emanation of God then we can easily accept that whatever transition we may ever face, even death, can be viewed in an almost unrecognizable blip on our eternal timeline.<\/p> <p>All the sages of all the ages have agreed that the human soul is something that is not a thing at all. It goes on and on and never ends. It is simply the constant variant that is carried over from one transition to the next, whatever they may be.<\/p> <p>While we never claim to know what these transitions are or what lay beyond them, we acknowledge that it is consistent to believe that we continue to expand in consciousness and as such, there is no transition that will ever be the \u201cend\u201d of our soul.<\/p> <p>Our speaker this week is Reverend Brian Akers, Senior Minister of the Columbia Center for Spiritual Living.\u00a0 Come to this Meetup and see if CCSL is the spiritual community that you have been looking for.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/7\/4\/600_422410612.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"6175 Sunny Spring, Columbia, MD 21044","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living\/events\/226541524\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":4500000,"name":"Sunday Experience","id":"226541524","time":1447599600000,"updated":1447605826000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412102441000,"name":"Columbia Center for Spiritual Living","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":17316882,"urlname":"Columbia-Center-for-Spiritual-Living","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":4,"distance":13.5802774429,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436741098000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a short 60-90 min back roads ride ending at a nice lunch spot(TBA). \u00a0FIVE MINIMUN NEEDED FOR THIS RIDE TO GO. \u00a0Don't forget to check the air in your tires (when they are COLD, not after you've been riding for a bit). \u00a0These colder temps suck the air right out. \u00a0You will be suprised at the difference from summer temps.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nLET'S DO IT!!!!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/WomenOn2-3\/events\/223878690\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Skippidy Bippidy Boo!","id":"223878690","time":1447600500000,"updated":1447678473000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1361744421000,"name":"Women On Two & Three","group_lon":-76.4100036621,"id":7328372,"urlname":"WomenOn2-3","group_lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Lady Riders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21201","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"306 W Franklin St","name":"Baltimore Ethical Society","lon":-76.62037,"id":489553,"state":"MD","lat":39.294926,"repinned":false},"headcount":33,"distance":0.34152123332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445945425000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Stone Salad &amp; Soup Fall Festival<\/p> <p>Celebrate the brisk days of autumn, at our Fall Festival.

John S. Mosby's grave site which is located near the center of Warrenton Cemetery in Warrenton, VA. For those with GPS: GPS Coordinates: Latitude:[masked], Longitude: -77.80003.<\/p> <p>John Singleton Mosby, also known by his nickname, the \"Gray Ghost\", was a Confederate army cavalry battalion commander in the American Civil War. His command, the 43rd Battalion, 1st Virginia Cavalry, known as Mosby's Rangers or Mosby's Raiders, was a partisan ranger unit noted for its lightning quick raids and its ability to elude Union Army pursuers and disappear, blending in with local farmers and townsmen. The area of northern central Virginia in which Mosby operated with impunity was known during the war and ever since as Mosby's Confederacy. After the war, Mosby became a Republican and worked as an attorney and supported his former enemy's commander, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant, serving as the American consul to Hong Kong and in the U.S. Department of Justice.<\/p> <p>Tip: There's a lot of information on the web about this famous Civil War veteran. Do a little research and formulate some questions that you would like answers to. Anything troubling or controversial should bring excellent results on your voice recorder and\/or video recorder. Bring a snack and something to drink. There are restaurants in the area, as well.\u00a0There is no cost for this investigation.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ILeague\/events\/226181680\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Investigation at Warrenton Cemetery","id":"226181680","time":1447610400000,"updated":1447683079000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1313817479000,"name":"The Investigators League of Dundalk","group_lon":-76.5,"id":2368711,"urlname":"ILeague","group_lat":39.2599983215,"who":"I League Investigators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21046","country":"us","city":"Columbia","address_1":"9891 Brokenland Parkway","name":"Lake Elkhorn","lon":-76.85183,"id":16982642,"state":"MD","lat":39.185452,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":10,"distance":14.3851108551,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447468784000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>***Please bring water for your dogs.<\/b><b>**<\/b><\/p> <p>Sunday will be sunny &amp; 57 degrees, wind at 9 mph. \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Please read directions below to find the Meeting Place:<\/b><\/p> <p>Park at the <b>Lakeview Office Park, 9821 Broken Land Parkway<\/b> parking lot on the other side of Broken Land Parkway from the dam end of Lake Elkhorn, Columbia, MD, 21046. \u00a0Please read the\u00a0whole \u00a0<b><i>description below<\/i><\/b><i><b>:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/8\/4\/600_341746212.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>WHERE TO MEET<\/p> <p>Please go to the <b>LAKEVIEW Office Park at\u00a09821 Broken Land Parkway,<\/b> Columbia, MD 21046.\u00a0 \u00a0Go to the driveway in front of the buildings and turn left. \u00a0Park by the edge of the woods. \u00a0Please take your dog out of the car, and\u00a0look for people with dogs. \u00a0They will be looking for you &amp; your dog too :)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 \u00a0(If you are coming from Broken Land Parkway at the Columbia Mall direction, it is easier to turn into the Woodmere Office Park, at \u00a09891 Broken Land Parkway, because it's at a traffic light, and you just turn right to get into it. \u00a0Also because it's really easy to pass by the entrance to Lakeview Office Park, which is over a hill. \u00a0If you turn in here, drive toward the metal sculpture, and TURN LEFT to continue on to LAKEVIEW OFFICE PARK AT 9821 Broken Land Parkway. \u00a0Stay on this driveway, go through a stop sign, and continue driving, passing by all of the buildings on your right.\u00a0\u00a0Keep driving all the way to the end, til you can't drive any further, and park at the edge of the WOODS.)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0When you get out of the car, <b>you should be able to see Lake Elkhorn <\/b>from the parking lot. \u00a0The <b>trail head starts\u00a0here<\/b> at the edge of the woods, close to Broken Land Parkway. \u00a0<b>This is where we will meet.<\/b> \u00a0Please take your dog out and show him around so others will know they're in the right spot :)\u00a0There is a tunnel that leads under Broken Land Parkway so we won't have to walk the dogs through traffic. \u00a0(The parking lot at the main entrance of the lake is too small to acommodate us, so we <b>don't use the main entrance to the lake.)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/d\/c\/600_341565532.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>SAFETY\/COURTESY<\/p> <p>\u00a0Please allow yourself time to arrive a few minutes <i><b>BEFORE\u00a0<\/b><\/i> the walk begins to allow the dogs to sniff each other and form their pack. \u00a0<b>W<\/b><b>e will step off on time.<\/b>\u00a0We will <b>turn right<\/b>\u00a0(counterclockwise)\u00a0at the lake, so if you are late, and can run to catch us, turn right. \u00a0(Otherwise, if you're really late, turn left so you will run into us at some point and we can all walk together.) \u00a0If you cannot make it <b>please change your RSVP<\/b> in a timely manner, or leave a note in the comments section. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/9\/7\/600_437970103.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Six foot length fixed leashes are required\u00a0<\/b>for your dog.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If <b>we stay over to the RIGHT<\/b> we can avoid the runners and bikers. \u00a0Also, if you see a BIKE or a RUNNER coming towards us from either direction, <b>please yell out \"BIKE!\" or \"RUNNER!\" or \"ON YOUR LEFT!\" so we can get our dogs safely to the RIGHT side to avoid them.<\/b> \u00a0Everyone else please <b>echo the warning so the whole group hears it<\/b>.

The proceeds from the raffles go to Tom Brown's Rookie League to support children with scholarships and to purchase equipment for the kids.\u00a0 Tom Brown is a Packers defensive back who played in Super Bowl 1 &amp; 2 who has a youth sports organization in Salisbury, MD.<\/p> <p>7-2!
