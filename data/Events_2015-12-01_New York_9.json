ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other. Belonging to BNI is like having dozens of salespeople representing your business, and in return you are representing their businesses. What goes around comes around. If I help you, you\u2019ll help me and we will both benefit as a result.<\/p> <p>The reason \u00a0BNI is so successful is that there is only one person per profession per chapter.

He then moved to Dortmund, Germany at the age of 17. Shortly after arriving in Germany, he established himself in the local jazz scene, taking part in the Dusseldorf Jazz Rally and Leipzig Jazz Days. After a few years he moved to the USA to further his studies at Berklee College of Music. Before graduating from Berklee, Vadim was asked to play and compose for a Berklee promotional recording produced by Pat Metheny. Just four weeks after his graduation, he was playing with Gary Burton at the Blue Note in New York. Since June 2004, Vadim has been consistently touring the US, Europe, Japan and Korea. Vadim's work has also been recognized with a number of recent awards. Additionally, he has been working as a Professor for Jazz Piano at world renowned Berklee College of Music in Boston \u00a0since January 2011.<\/p> <p>Ronen Itzik\u00a0is a multi-talented performer and composer. Audiences worldwide are captivated by his virtuosity, profound musicality and the passion he brings to performances. As a native of Jerusalem, Israel, Ronen incorporates his unique background and experience into his music. Since his arrival to the United States in December 2000, he has performed throughout the country, as well as in Europe, Central and South America, Canada and Israel. He has also performed and recorded with jazz greats such as Lee Konitz, Kenny Werner, Roy Hargrove, Hiromi Uehara, Ben Monder, Marcus Roberts, and Arnie Lawrence among many others, and has\u00a0established his reputation as one of the most sought-after drummers\u00a0and in-demand recording artist\u00a0in New York City.<\/p> <p>A fresh presence on the New York music scene,\u00a0Dan Loomis\u00a0has quickly become one the most in-demand bassists of his generation. \u00a0His musical roots lie in the historic jazz town of St. Louis, Missouri. \u00a0Dan has created a stir with both his powerful bass playing and his vision as a composer and bandleader. \u00a0He tours extensively throughout the US, Canada and Europe with his groups The Dan Loomis Quartet (DLQ), The Wee Trio, Spoke, and as a sideman with wildly diverse ensembles including the TS Monk Sextet, winning new audiences and bringing enthusiastic praise from critics.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Admission<\/b><\/p> <p>Admission is free for this event, but your\u00a0registration\u00a0at\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/agriculturaldreams.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/agriculturaldreams.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/agriculturaldreams.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a>\u00a0is required to gain access.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>How do I get there by subway?<\/b><\/p> <p>6: 51st St<\/p> <p>4\/5\/6\/7: Grand Central Terminal<\/p> <p>E\/M: Lexington Av\/53rd St<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Since the event is near 1st Ave &amp; 49th St, there is going to be a bit of a walk involved, keep that in mind for your timing &amp; check google maps for details.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>I will not be able to join this event or assist you with access on-site, please don't forget to register at Eventbrite (see link atop) for guaranteed access.\u00a0<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i>And - as always - change your RSVP status if your plans change.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/226905537\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":23400000,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlytpbgc","time":1448406000000,"updated":1448431070000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07601","country":"us","city":"Hackensack","address_1":"200 Hackensack Avenue","name":"Bergen County Technical Schools","lon":-74.034378,"id":16492012,"state":"NJ","lat":40.902111,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.7847490311,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446687349000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come learn <b>video game design<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Gamestar Mechanic uses fun, game-based quests and courses to help you learn game design and make your own video games!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0PLAY and LEARN<\/b> - Go on Quests that power up your game design skills and let you earn items you can use to make your own games<\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0TAKE COURSES<\/b> -\u00a0Take game design courses with professional instructors and get feedback on your designs from game industry pros<\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>MAKE YOUR OWN GAMES<\/b> -Make original games with a powerful, easy-to-use design tool and a library of hundreds of sprites<\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0<\/b><b>JOIN THE\u00a0COMMUNITY<\/b>\u00a0-\u00a0Publish your games and connect with a community of over 250,000 designers whose games have been played over 5 million times<\/p> <p><i><b>PD: Attention TEACHERS, come find out how to teach Gamestar Mechanic in your school<\/b><\/i>!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/48441764\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/48441764<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/2\/2\/600_444051234.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/2\/4\/600_444051236.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/2\/7\/600_444051239.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/2\/d\/600_444051245.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/3\/6\/600_444051254.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are located in the Adult and Continuing Education building.

But now he is the one being hunted. Whose prey has he become? And what is it that he has that these people will kill to get? Lime is a Danish paparazzo, living in Madrid. For more than 20 years he has stalked and captured the rich and famous on film, making vast sums of money from exposing their secrets - the more salacious the image, the bigger the fee.

This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort. A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane.

There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Hope to attend another informative session :)\u201d<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn to improve your photography through a gentle and honest interactive online photo critique led by two seasoned professional photographers. The very best way to take your photography to the next level is to get personal feedback. These critiques are a great place to feel safe, talk about your work and get constructive feedback from well-traveled professional photographers, <a href=\"http:\/\/LorenPhotos.com\">Loren Fisher<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/vickielewis.com\">Vickie Lewis<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Loren has been a professional photographer and photo editor since 1978. He is an adjunct professor at Rutgers University and sells his works at art shows and festivals throughout the East Coast.<\/p> <p>Vickie has been a professional photographer and editor for over 30 years and has shot over 150 portraits for People Magazine. Her work is represented by The National Geographic image collection. Both Loren and Vickie love working with photographers of all levels and conduct workshops across the country.<\/p> <p>To assure personal attention during the critiques, we limit the number of photographers being critiqued to six. Photographers being critiqued will be able to interact with both Vickie and Loren and get their questions answered. We\u2019ve been doing critiques for a long time and realize that just listening can be educational too and so we are inviting all our Meetup group members to view the critiques for free.<\/p> <p>The first six photographers who sign up to be critiqued will send 8-10 photos via email. Send your best, a recent shoot or something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. Due to time limitations, we probably won\u2019t critique all the photos each photographer submits, but we like to have a selection to look at to help you improve. We will make sure those who choose to participate get personal attention.<\/p> <p>It doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something! We believe in gentle critiques where we assure that you learn something and feel good about your work when you are done.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you\u2019d like to have your photos critiqued, the price is $25 per person.

Much higher level of meditation in group than I can achieve doing my own practice. I was very happy to find a meditation group that was focused on bringing together community members to practice meditation. Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan. \u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!! Every time I practice Bodhi meditation, it feels like my Chi increases more and more!

Here is an excerpt from a blog I found online from travel gal at timesunion.com... I\u2019ve wanted to go to the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade Big Balloon Blow-Up ever since I saw a particularly funny episode on Seinfeld. As I remember it, on the night before Thanksgiving, Elaine is anxious to be invited to a popular party held at an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Central Park West. The party is held every year at that time, and it centers around the apartment\u2019s great view of the balloons being inflated before the next day\u2019s big parade. As you can expect from this comedy series, Elaine attends, things don\u2019t go well, and at least one poor balloon loses its life. Horton at the Big Balloon Blow-Up Well, last year I got my wish when my family and I went down to see the event. We weren\u2019t disappointed because this was a great experience. The Big Balloon Blow-Up is free, and it takes place on 77th and 81st streets between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. Although there was a short barricade, we were able to get very close to the balloons that, usually, you\u2019d only be able to see on TV.

Ever find yourself looking across the bar and saying, \u201cHe\u2019s cute, I wonder if he\u2019s single\u201d or \u201cShe seems nice, but maybe she has a boyfriend\". Well, wonder no more! Everyone at a Click event is single and looking to meet someone. At every Click event we set up fun ice breakers to get the party going (during which you can win prizes!) You can participate or just relax and mingle at your own pace.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 We get it... You want to meet someone but don't feel like hanging out in bars amongst a bunch of early 20 somethings or wasting time weeding through online dating profiles. You've been there, done that and want to find your mature match who is tired of all the childish games and ready for something real. This event is perfect for you!

It's tempting to hope that interactive theorem proving could become a mundane part of programming practice in industry, where designs are validated by computer-assisted proof rather than tests or manual review.<\/p> <p><br\/>This talk will present a new ITP system called Lean [3], which is based on dependent type theory. It will also give an overview of the basics of interactive theorem proving, outlining the system design (contrasting it to programming language design) and showing concrete examples. First we will give an overview of the general approach and present some basic examples to help give a feel for the everyday practice of proving theorems. The second part of the talk will then contrast Lean with other ITP systems (such as Coq and Agda) and give some taste of the more advanced features of the system.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>Cody Roux has a PhD in Type Theory from INRIA, and worked on elements of the Lean theorem prover while a Postdoc at CMU, particularly the elaborator.

Whether you are looking to connect with a loved one who has recently passed or to receive messages from spirit, our group offers a warm and friendly environment to all who are interested. Before each s\u00e9ance we begin our group with a 15 minute lesson on psychic development, covering topics from psychic impressions to spirit communication. We then begin our s\u00e9ance with a nondenominational prayer of protection and lead a guided visual mediation. After the meditation each person who attends will receive a message from one of our highly trained s\u00e9ance conductors. All participants are guaranteed to receive a message. Our group meets for approximately 2 hours. The purpose of our s\u00e9ance is to communicate directly with spirit and to form an open and inviting spiritual community in New York City Our meeting times are every other Wednesday Night at 7:00pm and our fee is $20.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226996988\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"TURKEY BOWL XXI - Flag Football Game - Thanksgiving morning @ 9:00 am!","id":"226996988","time":1448546400000,"updated":1448699909000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07005","country":"us","city":"Montville ","address_1":"Boonton Ave and Mars Ct intersection","name":"Pyramid Mountain","lon":-74.387268,"id":8907562,"state":"NJ","lat":40.947166,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.8839874268,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447388277000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's go out to Turkey Mountain and take a short hike in the morning.

They would be who you see in the photo above. Free living, social non-human animals.<\/p> <p><b>Turkey story #1:<\/b> The boyfriend and I were driving through the Adirondack Park in early October and all of a sudden we had to hit the brakes. About a dozen turkeys were making their way across the road. We were all cognizant of one another for those few minutes, making eye contact and constantly checking in until they were in the clear and we were able to drive on. Two worlds met in a heartbeat - the world of free living animals with their own society and the world of humans that have paved through their realm without thought.<\/p> <p><b>Turkey story #2:<\/b>\u00a0A few years ago VegOut went to the Catskill Animal Sanctuary for a Volunteer Farm Chore Day. I happened upon the great sheep Rambo who presided over the main barn with care for those he saw in his dominion. In the stillness of the moment, the greatness of his presence calmed me. He folded his legs beneath his body so that his torso was on the barn floor. Three turkeys walked up to him, knelt and lay their necks over his back. Rambo and the turkeys shut their eyes. I wish I knew their names. Kathy Stevens, the Director of CAS, writes in Animal Camp about the Audacity of Love. This blissful image of love informs me daily.<\/p> <p>Learn more about Rambo, the teacher and flock caregiver, here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/casanctuary.org\/2012\/05\/rambo-moves-on\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/casanctuary.org\/2012\/05\/rambo-moves-on\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/casanctuary.org\/2012\/05\/rambo-moves-on\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>So what can we do on Thanksgiving? We can be thankful for knowing about these magnificent birds. We can hold them close in our hearts. In all likelihood, we all share a bird eating past. Some of us share a bird eating present. I encourage everyone to make the acquaintance of a turkey. Get to know an individual. Cooked muscle has been a part of our lives at one point or another. Let's get to know these birds. Guilt sucks so let's not pointlessly indulge. The point is, we know better and can celebrate abundance in the here and now. As a human animal, what is abundance? Well, relative to our peers around the globe we can sleep indoors and have potable water with little thought. We can think about what to bring! what to bring! to a potluck knowing that some of us will wow with culinary sophistication and others will elevate a humble ingredient simply and elegantly. Cedar planked leek\/shiitake stuffed seitan served with cranberry\/shiraz reduction or a humble potato coaxed to perfection with a little salt, some fresh ground pepper and a splash of olive oil? Decisions decisions. Both are magnificent.<\/p> <p><br\/>What am I thankful for? I am thankful for ever evolving consciousness. I am thankful for the many friendships that I've made and that you have all made through VegOut. Most of all I'm thankful for turkeys and grateful for how they enrich our world.

We are currently meeting on Mondays and Friday approximately noon until 4:30 at a Mamaroneck forest location and Wednesdays at 9:30. \u00a0You can join for one or more of these days - whatever works best for you.<\/p> <p>Forest play school is a nature-based option that is held exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather (rain, snow, cold), children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a designated outdoor forest environment where the children and parents meet each week all year. This play school is play-based and parent supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. The structure of the group is inspired by the Forest Kindergarten program, which is very popular in other parts of the world and is gradually spreading throughout the US. Cutting-edge research is showing that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development - physical, emotional, and spiritual. \u00a0The children are engaging in very important \"work\" through playing and navigating relationships in play school.<\/p> <p>Each parent practices gentle guidance, patience and positive role modeling for all of the children while helping them navigate sometimes complex social situations. \u00a0Our goal is for each child to feel safe and respected by the mothers and their peers while at play school. \u00a0Each week the parents read a parenting article on positive\/gentle parenting in order to discuss together.<\/p> <p>The children feel at home in our forest location. \u00a0We prepare ourselves appropriately for the day's weather, practically this means layers, extra clothes, and sun\/wind\/rain\/snow protection. The children find joy and amusement from the sticks, stones, bugs and plants around them, therefore they don't need to bring toys to play school. A spirit of open exploration and creativity permeates the group. \u00a0Each parent brings their own healthy food for their children (either lunch or snacks, depending on the family\u2019s needs). \u00a0Most days include some songs and read-alouds.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here is what some of the parents are saying:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u201cWe love our time in the forest. \u00a0Being in the forest feels therapeutic for me and the kids. \u00a0The forest is our little sanctuary where time stands still. \u00a0The children feel deeply connected to the forest - they uncover the details of their forest home more and more each week and watch the seasons unfold right before their eyes. \u00a0There is something so magical about having no toys and watching them play so creatively. \u00a0This type of play is so ideal for problem solving, critical thinking and decision making. And the physical environment is so wonderful for gross and fine motor skill development- it provides so much more than a playground ever could!\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SouthernWestchesterAttachmentParents\/events\/226932006\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Rock Climbers - Forest Play School","id":"fnbkmlytpbkc","time":1448645400000,"updated":1448656900000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1327613643000,"name":"Southern Westchester Attachment Parenting Group","group_lon":-73.7799987793,"id":3174552,"urlname":"SouthernWestchesterAttachmentParents","group_lat":41.0299987793,"who":"AP Parents"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":18.167470932,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447295809000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Everyone!!

Unfortunately, you will not be able to attend.<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that people not post any comments or questions prior to the event. You will have all the information you need to do this once you get the meeting place details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know what you are doing that day (and probably neither does anyone else) if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather is really bad or there is a really bad forecast, Check Accuweather like I do, I will post a notice by very early on the day of the event canceling.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue.

Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance.

It has been called Akasha, Logos, the primordial OM, the music of the spheres, the Higgs field, dark energy, and a thousand other names throughout history. The vibratory field is at the root of all true spiritual experience and scientific investigation. It is the same field of energy that saints, Buddhas, yogis, mystics, priests, shamans and seers, have observed by looking within themselves. Many of history's monumental thinkers, such a Pythagoras, Kepler, Leonardo DaVinci, Tesla, and Einstein, have come to the threshold of this great mystery. It is the common link between all religions, all sciences, and the link between our inner worlds and our outer worlds.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/f\/2\/600_422545842.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/226188543\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Mystical Movie Night: The Serpent and the Lotus from Inner Worlds, Outer Worlds","id":"fpbtflytpbkc","time":1448667000000,"updated":1448679401000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York City","address_1":"204 Varick Street","address_2":"West Houston","lon":-74.005325,"phone":"(212) 243-4940","name":"SOB's","id":905928,"state":"NY","lat":40.728471,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.69355368614,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1404775040000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>SOB's is back for free Salsa lesson and Live band !\u00a0<\/p> <p>Free Salsa Lesson at 7pm\u00a0if you RSVP and get in on time.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is how you do it:\u00a0<\/p> <p>1.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p><br\/>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change\u00a0<\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a>\u00a0<br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a>\u00a0<br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/223113554\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"7pm  - Happiness Rap Session at Ritz Carlton building 1 White Plains","id":"xljmhlytpbkc","time":1448668800000,"updated":1448686699000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"610 W 56th St., Between 11th and 12th Avenues","name":"Terminal 5 ","lon":-74.005974,"id":5919012,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448286369000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.terminal5nyc.com\/event\/918971-paul-van-dyk-new-york\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.terminal5nyc.com\/event\/918971-paul-van-dyk-new-york\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Trance-EDM-Meetup\/events\/226966640\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Paul van Dyk at Terminal 5","id":"226966640","time":1448668800000,"updated":1448680850000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397238568000,"name":"Jersey City Trance\/EDM Meetup","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":13859462,"urlname":"Jersey-City-Trance-EDM-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11209","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"9016 4th Avenue","name":"Yoga in Bay Ridge","lon":-74.029999,"id":10015882,"state":"NY","lat":40.619518,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.27481174469,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448239732000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Are you interested in deepening your yoga practice?<br\/>Do you want to learn a way to practice yoga when you can't do physical asana?<\/p> <p>Then consider adding mantra and meditation to your yoga practice!<\/p> <p>In this group practice you will learn the meditation practice outlined in \"The Yoga Sutras of Pantajali\", often referred to as the path of Raja Yoga.

If that wasn't bad enough, there's also the assassins of a legendary death cult and an up-and-coming megalomaniac (as brilliant as he is bodiless) who have marked Emperor for their own nefarious purposes. But Mollusk isn't about to let the Earth slip out of his own tentacles and into the less capable clutches of another. So it's time to dust off the old death ray and come out of retirement.

Did you eat too much turkey, and feel the need to dance it off? Did you shop hard for Black Friday, and need to de-stress? Whatever your reasons, we've got you covered!<\/p> <p>This week, we have special guest teacher Stephen York teaching our Intermediate class! The topic is called \"Learning to Dance with the Blues Aesthetic.\" Stephen fell in love with blues dancing back in 2008 when it came to Boston. Since then, he has traveled the country learning from the best teachers he could find what makes the blues the blues, and how to dance to it. This week he's coming to New York to show you how to use your body to move from the ground up to dance musically to the blues!<\/p> <p>And not only is Stephen going to teach the Intermediate lesson - he's going to spin for us, too! What a treat!!<\/p> <p>Remember, the Spanish Benevolent Society at La Nacional is a non-profit organization. They enjoy having us blues dancers there, but we need your help in supporting the venue, by purchasing drinks at the bar. If each dancer who comes in buys just a soda or a bottle of water, you'll be helping contribute to Friday Night Blues continuing to have a lasting relationship with La Nacional for a long time to come!<\/p> <p><br\/>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>SCHEDULE:<\/p> <p>8:30pm-9:30pm - Fundamentals Lesson w\/ Shira<\/p> <p>8:30pm-9:30pm - Intermediate Lesson w\/ Stephen York<\/p> <p>9:30pm-1:00am - DJ\u2019d Dance w\/ Stephen York<\/p> <p><br\/>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>The lesson costs $10, and the dance is $12 (cash only). But if you pay for both at the same time, it's just $20 for the night! Discount punch cards are also available at the fornt desk.(Volunteering gets you in for free! [masked] for more info.)<\/p> <p>Bring socks or dance shoes with slippery soles\u00a0(for easy turning). It's especially important to have clean, dry shoes when it's wet outside.<\/p> <p>There is no dress code, but hygiene is important and dressing up a bit is a nice thing to do. Prioritize comfort and ability to move!<\/p> <p><br\/>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p>CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:<\/p> <p>**Please plan to arrive on time. After 15 minutes have passed, dancers are asked to wait outside the dance space until the lesson is over.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nFundamentals (8:30pm-9:30pm):<\/p> <p>Fundamentals classes are for students new to blues dance and experienced students looking to hone their blues dance fundamentals. We cover how to connect with the music, how to connect with a partner, and have a rotating set of material to introduce students to important concepts in blues partner dance. These classes will give you everything you need to know to have a successful dance, and whet your appetite for more!<\/p> <p><br\/>Intermediate (8:30pm-9:30pm**):<\/p> <p>Intermediate series are technique-based classes designed to build specific knowledge and skills in students with prior blues dance experience. Intermediate classes are aimed to expand your knowledge depth in a specific topic of blues vocabulary through body awareness and historical context. Ultimately, taking class is your vehicle to having even more fun on the dance floor!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BluesDanceNewYork\/events","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Friday-Night-Blues-NYC\/events\/226615491\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Friday Night Blues","id":"hcnxllytpbkc","time":1448674200000,"updated":1448701628000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446516679000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19085086,"urlname":"Friday-Night-Blues-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"160 Schermerhorn St.","name":"Brooklyn Ballet","lon":-73.987437,"id":1463375,"state":"NY","lat":40.689236,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.20915365219,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445372783000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and TurnOn.
