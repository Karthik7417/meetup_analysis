Vocal strength starts to increase all on its own now and more tonal and articulation clarity is another benefit. We will start with the BreathingRx For Singers warm up and bring back the full body balance and release movement qualities for each section of the body, (while singing something fun!). I will show you how to do the world\u2019s fastest warm up and we will bring in a little dance move to free up the diaphragm even more. You will then find your individual movement style dialing in the whole body in ideal release and activity for singing! This is where the magic starts to happen\u2026<br\/>Singers, voice teachers, actors and speakers are invited to come and gain an appreciation about why this work is setting a new standard for vocal support. And, it also increases your expressiveness and joy!<br\/>This workshop will be filmed to be turned into an e-course product and for your participation you will be given access to all 6 workshops for your continued study.

All matter is energy vibrating at different frequencies. By altering the rate of vibration we can change the structure of matter, including healing ourselves by restoring the normal vibratory frequencies of out-of-harmony parts of the body.<br\/>Long known only to the initiated, the singing bowls have been used since ancient times in India and the Himalayas for healing and as meditation aids to help transcend into higher states of consciousness.<\/p> <p>Our body has its own built-in healing system. Sounds and music are powerful tools for bringing our physical, psychological and spiritual selves back into harmony. The special frequencies and sound patterns produced by the singing bowls have been shown to affect a remarkable and swift improvement with physical, mental and emotional issues.<\/p> <p>Singing bowls help in all areas of our Being, including<\/p> <p>\u2022 Deep relaxation<br\/>\u2022 Mental clarity, increased energy and positive outlook<br\/>\u2022 Increased self-confidence and creative potential<br\/>\u2022 Releasing negative patterns, e.g. past relationships or worries and fears<br\/>\u2022 Relieving tension and blockages, releasing toxins<br\/>\u2022 Stimulating optimal functioning of cells, tissues and organs<br\/>\u2022 Improving the functioning of all physiological systems, e.g. nervous system, digestive, circulatory, lymphatic, cardio-vascular and endocrine<br\/>\u2022 Alleviating physical pain, e.g. backache, joints, headaches, etc.<\/p> <p>Guy Yair Beider is highly trained and certified by \u201cNine Ways Academy\u201d in the Himalayan sound healing arts.

Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us. I met some of the most fun and amazing people, the comics were a full top Comedy Central line up too. For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>Hosted By: Leah Bonnema, Gary Vider. Gregory K (Orange is the New Black), Seaton Smith (Comedy Central), Damien Lemon (MTV), Jeff Leach (Comedy Central) and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>Remember its a 2 drink minimum like any other comedy club or jazz club runs like $18. I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup. Or if you would like to come for the 10 you can just say meetup at the door and they will point you to me.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/228891573\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Comedy Central Meetup at Stand Up New York Free, 2 drnk min Gregory from Russia","id":"228891573","time":1456101000000,"updated":1456113034000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213936546000,"name":"Free NYC!

The talk\/discussion will focus on media and their influence; how people engaged with media in the midst of the emergency, and the media impact on residents of Fukushima including \u201cDamaged by Rumors.\u201d The event will be held in Japanese with English translation.<\/p> <p>Facilitator \u2013 Keiko Tsuyama, Journalist living in New York<\/p> <p>Participants and discussion topic:<\/p> <p>Arata Oowada, Radio Fukushima announcer \u2013 How Media reported on the nuclear accident<\/p> <p>Hiroshi Kainuma, Associate Professor of Fukushima Univ. &amp; FURE \u2013 The Media and Fukushima<\/p> <p>Naoya Sekiya, Associate Professor of Tokyo Univ. - How Media reported on the nuclear accident &amp; their influence on \u201cDamage by Rumor\u201d<\/p> <p>Students of Ritsumeikan Univ in Kyoto \u2013 Approach to eat &amp; support Fukushima at cafeteria<\/p> <p>Yuri Oota, Translator<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/a\/3\/b\/600_446539003.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Documentary-Watchers-NYC-Meetup\/events\/228615331\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Screen & Discuss 1\/10 Ask Fukushima (2013)","id":"228615331","time":1456164000000,"updated":1456179066000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454613004000,"name":"Documentary Watchers NYC Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19510097,"urlname":"Documentary-Watchers-NYC-Meetup","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Documentary Watchers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"250 Broadway 16th Floor","name":"New York City Council Committee Room","lon":-74.00782,"id":24377896,"state":"NY","lat":40.712982,"repinned":false},"headcount":40,"distance":2.7282166481,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455914111000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The New York City Council Committee on Environmental Protection will hold a hearing on Int 446 in relation to banning the discharge, disposal, sale or use of fracking waste in New York City and Res 791 in relation to calling upon the General Electric Corporation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to enter into an agreement that expands the scope of the Hudson River PCBs remediation plan.<\/p> <p>While New York State currently banned high-volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing, we still have conventional vertical drilling oil and gas wells in New York State. In addition, Pennsylvania has been fracking thousands of wells and is projecting to frack thousands more. New York State\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is permitting solid and liquid treatment facilities to accept Pennsylvania\u2019s waste. DEC is also permitting conventional fracking waste from New York State for road spreading to suppress dust, to stabilize, and to de-ice. Since New York State legislature has not yet enacted any ban fracking waste legislation, New York City needs to pass a ban fracking waste bill to protect the residents of New York City. The most recent blizzard hitting New York City reminded us that none of us wanted to have toxic brine spread on the city\u2019s roads as road salt which could pollute our water and air and harm the health of people living and working in New York City as well as the health of our pets. Think of all the dog owners walking their dogs in the snow and slush. Passage of Int. 446 will ensure that toxic oil and gas brine is never used on New York City roads.<\/p> <p>Council member Steve Levin introduced Int 446 in 2014. It\u2019s taken us working on this bill for two years to finally have a hearing scheduled. A hearing is a necessary step before any bill can be brought to the city council floor for a vote. We can also suggest changes to a bill at a hearing. We need to have a big turnout at the hearing and as many people testify as possible to show our city elected officials that we care about this bill and want this bill to pass. We hope that each of you would include the following two important changes we want in Int 446 in your testimony:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Increase the penalty for non-compliance from the current $100 per violation to at least $25,000. (A $100 fine is not a deterrent. At least 11 counties in New York State have included a penalty provision in their fracking waste bans that provide for a fine up to $25,000 per violation.)<\/p> <p>\u2022 Definition of waste should not be limited to only waste from natural gas extraction activities. It should include all relevant forms of oil and natural gas waste, including waste from oil and natural gas storage.<\/p> <p>For more details please go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unitedforaction.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.unitedforaction.org\/<\/a> home page.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Grassroots-Alliance\/events\/228981463\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Attend NYC Council Hearing on Ban Fracking Waste Bill","id":"228981463","time":1456164000000,"updated":1456178721000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1336248260000,"name":"NYC Grassroots Alliance","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3805572,"urlname":"NYC-Grassroots-Alliance","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Allies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":19,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453135894000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Happy New Year urban professionals,<\/p> <p>If you ever thought about starting your own business.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this.

Rub-down type made it possible for students, professionals, and everyone else to design with real typefaces, without needing professional typesetting services. A cheap and easy way to experiment with typography and other graphic elements, Letraset put a lot of care into making type easy to use well, but it also resulted in a lot of ways to use type badly, but with interesting results. With some care and attention, however, it was a great way to develop an eye for typography.<\/p> <p>Dan Rhatigan worked as a designer and typographer for 15 years in Boston and New York before moving to England in 2006 for graduate school at the University of Reading.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.\u00a0<br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses\u00a0<br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.\u00a0<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.\u00a0<br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you\u00a0<br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind\u00a0<br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.\u00a0<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Clustergrammer is a web-based matrix visualization tool, built using D3, that enables users to easily generate highly-interactive (zooming, reordering, searching, and filtering) and shareable clustergram-heatmap visualizations. Clustergrammer also provides dynamic visualizations for several other web-apps in the Ma\u2019ayan lab. The presentation will address the motivations behind the project, how D3 was used to build the visualization, and some of my challenges\/experiences with D3 along the way.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

To me this means bringing presence, mindfulness, awareness, and connection with yourself and others into everything you do. I\u2019ve been cultivating this practice over the last 8 years and I must say, it is much easier to hold a safe space with compassion and acceptance for myself and others, no matter where I am since bringing these practices into my life as a Highly Sensitive Person. {Side Note: I used to loathe going to parties or social events where I didn\u2019t know anyone b\/c I always felt a disconnect with who might be there. I had a pervasive worry of being misunderstood and feeling overwhelmed as I crept into the people pleasing shadow and didn\u2019t know how to break free from it. Since committing to a meditation practice, being mindful, and aware of how I am feeling at all times, I am able to step away when I need to, ask for what I need, and be vulnerable in a safe way that doesn't make the other person fell uncomfortable. Over time, this has gotten much better, and my ability to create boundaries with others has gotten stronger and more effective\u2026allowing for connection rather than judgment and isolation.} So there\u2019s my little spiel to give you a taste of what this month\u2019s podcast will be about.<\/p> <p>If it resonates with you, I recommend registering to receive the podcast here, which will be released Tuesday February 23rd at 6am EST:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>--- --- ---<\/p> <p>And now a few words to get the ball rolling...!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Why is meditation important if you are a HSP? Here are just 3 reasons...\u00a0<\/p> <p>1. We are easily Over-Stimulated. Mindfulness Meditation and other Energy Management practices can train your subconscious mind to filter through the stimuli you receive from your environment much more efficiently so that overstimulation happens less and you feel less overwhelmed and reactive to your environment. In turn, you will start to feel more present, consciously responsive, clear, and grounded in your interactions; enjoyable or challenging.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. We Feel Deeply. This is indeed one of our gifts! But this strength turns into a shortcoming when it is not properly utilized and managed. I'm certain at some point on your journey you've been emotionally overwhelmed and didn't know how to balance the emotional roller coaster, yes? I know I've struggled with this. CONSISTENTLY practicing mindfuless practices helps you become more aware of what you are feeling SOONER so that your emotions don't take you over, but rather, allow you to shift earlier than later when your emotions feel daunting, heavy, and out of control. Let's rein those emotions in early, shall we? Meditation = Our Friend.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3. We Think Deeply. Another gift of ours that allow us to think outside of the box and utilize our inner world (our imagination) that is expansive and creative. Our depth in thinking and processing allows us to be open to possibilities, be insightful, and create meaning out of this (so it seems) flat life that we are living. But again, this strength turns into a shortcoming when you go too far down the rabbit hole of judgment and constrictive thought processes. Instead, why consciously choose what you allow yourself to think and imagine? I can't tell you how many times I used my deep thinking skills, my imagination, to WORRY about potential false outcomes. I did this to try and prevent myself from being hurt. However, worry does not prevent you from failing or getting hurt, it only puts you in a space of fear, activating your stress response, and actually prevents your brain from problem solving quickly and efficiently in a time of need. Will you choose panic? Or presence and assertiveness? Meditation \u2013 3 Worry \u2013 0 Meditation helps with ALL of these (and more!). Come and meditate with me. Beginners are welcome, and of course, for those of you have been doing this for awhile, it\u2019s always a good idea to revisit what you've already heard b\/c one of the things many HSPs struggle with is CONSISTENCY. \"We can do together what we can never do alone.\" <b>Register for the Meditation for HSPs podcast here:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/forms.aweber.com\/form\/28\/1391980528.htm<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Once you register, you will be added to my virtual community where you will receive my videos, podcasts, and email updates.

The OWASP Benchmark contains over 20,000 test cases that are fully runnable and exploitable, each of which maps to the appropriate CWE number for that vulnerability. You can use the OWASP Benchmark with Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools like OWASP ZAP and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) tools.

We\u2019ll then generate the XAML\/C# source code and dive into Visual Studio to understand the various parts produced by App Studio and how to extend them. We\u2019ll discuss how to add custom features to the starter app, turning our prototype into a real-world app, such as advertising, in-app purchasing and such. Lastly we\u2019ll go over what\u2019s involved to get the app published, how the submission process works, and where to take your app from there.<\/p> <p>If you still haven\u2019t published any mobile apps, it doesn\u2019t get any easier than with App Studio. Come learn how to get from \u201cIdea\u201d to \u201cPublish\u201d in just a few hours.<\/p> <p><b>OPTIONAL: BRING YOUR LAPTOP!<\/b> You'll be able to simply attend the session and watch the demonstration as I build and publish a live app, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you bring your laptop and follow along as you build your own app. You can even do this on a Mac!<\/p> <p><b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActiveNick\">@ActiveNick<\/a>) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.

They are fruit hunters, the subjects of the new film from acclaimed director Yung Chang (Up the Yangtze, China Heavyweight).<\/p> <p><br\/>The Fruit Hunters travels across culture, history and geography to show how intertwined we are with the fruits we eat. Our guides are devoted fruit fanatics. Movie star Bill Pullman\u2019s obsession leads him on a crusade to create a community orchard in the Hollywood Hills. Adventurers Noris Ledesma and Richard Campbell scour the jungle for rare mangos, hoping to intervene before the plants are steamrolled by industrialization. Pioneering scientist Juan Aguilar races to breed bananas resistant to a deadly fungus that threatens the worldwide crop. And fruit detectives including Isabella Dalla Ragione investigate Renaissance-era paintings for clues, hoping to rediscover lost fruits. And, of course, there are the fruits themselves, presented in all their mouthwatering glory: cherimoyas, ice cream beans, durians and more.<\/p> <p>A cinematic odyssey through nature and commerce, The Fruit Hunters will change not only the way we look at what we eat but how we view our relationship to the natural world.<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information call[masked]\u00a0or email [masked].<\/p> <p>Sponsored by the Indoor Gardening Society of New York<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About the Indoor Gardening Society<\/b>...<\/p> <p>IGS is a great way to introduce adults and children to the importance of green plants.

But Enterprise Content Strategy sometimes sounds as if it\u2019s a huge and unassailable concept. Images such as a boiling ocean come to mind. Maybe some folks feel that they can\u2019t even get their heads around a singular channel engagement (a website) let alone an enterprise. But what if all these seemingly insurmountable constraints are what is keeping you from realizing the full potential of your content in the first place? What if boiling the ocean is merely a mirage for a reality you can in fact face and against which you can stand you content up for success?<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s reframe the questions: How many folks work in companies which we could identify as an enterprise? How many folks work in companies that produce content? How many folks think that their company\u2019s content could and should be better?<\/p> <p>This talk will give you five key points:<\/p> <p>1.\u00a0Content strategy for the entire content ecosystem, it\u2019s no longer a nice to have<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0It takes a user and a content-first approach<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0Cross-channel experience is everything and requires an enterprise focus<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0Operations should reflect the strategy and the user<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0Performance is everything<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/cs-nyc\/events\/228588778\/","yes_rsvp_count":139,"name":"Enterprise Content Strategy: Standing your Content up for Success","id":"228588778","time":1456270200000,"updated":1456349249000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256939379000,"name":"Content Strategy NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1549292,"urlname":"cs-nyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"CSNYC members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"68 Jay St. Suite 718","name":"DUMBO Startup Lab","lon":-73.986755,"id":6519002,"state":"NY","lat":40.702801,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":3.27229142189,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424129300000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet us on\u00a0the <b>last Tuesday of the Month<\/b>\u00a0to learn, discuss and practice\u00a0<b>Business Model Generation<\/b>\u00a0(BMG), the\u00a0Canvas, a little bit of Lean Startup and overall business common sense.<\/p> <p>This methodology is a simple way to get a high level view of your current or future business and understand how each part of it integrates and interacts with the others.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/228934326\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvdbfc","time":1456270200000,"updated":1456281861000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":3.4617433548,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455750406000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For those sick of \"just talk\" and \"no action\"...

How can you, as an individual investor, select socially responsible investments (SRIs)? How does environmental, social and governance (ESG) data shape your investment portfolio? What is the future of responsible investment?\u00a0<\/p> <p>A few of the questions we\u2019ll attempt to answer in this panel that takes us behind the curtain of funder decisions.<\/p> <p>The last decade has witnessed a growing market focus on socially responsible and sustainable investment options. Data from Bloomberg shows that between 2006 and 2015 the total amount of SRI (socially responsible investment) assets has increased more than 150x to $2.3 trillion.\u00a0As corporations increase the\u00a0transparency\u00a0of their operations by releasing more environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data, investors get a better understanding of the social impact resulting from their investment choices. With this shift, companies now need to answer a new set of questions that will influence investment decisions, such as \u2018how much greenhouse gas will be emitted\u2019, \u2018how much water will be used\u2019, \u2018how many jobs will be created\u2019 and \u2018what is the social ROI of every dollar invested\u2019? Simultaneously,\u00a0entrepreneurs gain access to new funding opportunities by attracting individual investors and angel investors who are willing to fund projects that result in a tangible social ROI.\u00a0<\/p> <p>However, the growing number of socially-responsible investment (SRI) products and green projects also bring several challenges to be tackled by investors, entrepreneurs and fund managers. Matching the ESG performance with market return, evaluating the true impacts of a project and developing the right strategy to attract angel investors to a new start-up are only few of them. Bringing experts from different sides of the equation this panel explores these challenges and discusses the solutions developed to solve them.<\/p> <p><b>Meet Our Moderator &amp; Panelists:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sonay Aykan, PhD.<\/b><\/p> <p>Sonay is a Senior Sustainability Analyst at iCompli Sustainability Services, which is a subdivision of BPA Worldwide.

How can you, as an individual investor, select socially responsible investments (SRIs)? How does environmental, social and governance (ESG) data shape your investment portfolio? What is the future of responsible investment? A few of the questions we\u2019ll attempt to answer in this panel that takes us behind the curtain of funder decisions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The last decade has witnessed a growing market focus on socially responsible and sustainable investment options. Data from Bloomberg shows that between 2006 and 2015 the total amount of SRI (socially responsible investment) assets has increased more than 150x to $2.3 trillion. As corporations increase the transparency of their operations by releasing more environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data, investors get a better understanding of the social impact resulting from their investment choices. With this shift, companies now need to answer a new set of questions that will influence investment decisions, such as \u2018how much greenhouse gas will be emitted\u2019, \u2018how much water will be used\u2019, \u2018how many jobs will be created\u2019 and \u2018what is the social ROI of every dollar invested\u2019? Simultaneously, entrepreneurs gain access to new funding opportunities by attracting individual investors and angel investors who are willing to fund projects that result in a tangible social ROI. However, the growing number of socially-responsible investment (SRI) products and green projects also bring several challenges to be tackled by investors, entrepreneurs and fund managers. Matching the ESG performance with market return, evaluating the true impacts of a project and developing the right strategy to attract angel investors to a new start-up are only few of them. Bringing experts from different sides of the equation this panel explores these challenges and discusses the solutions developed to solve them.<\/p> <p><b>Meet Our Moderator &amp; Panelists:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sonay Aykan, PhD.<\/b><\/p> <p>Sonay is a Senior Sustainability Analyst at iCompli Sustainability Services, which is a subdivision of BPA Worldwide.

subregions within it\u2014Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Castilla y Le\u00f3n is the largest of Spain\u2019s 17 administrative regions and covers the northern half of the central Iberian plateau.\u00a0 The region\u2019s agriculture is largely focused on grains, but viticulture has taken place here for a couple of millennia.\u00a0 The climate is very much continental\u2014hot summers, cold winters, sharp daily temperature shifts during the growing season.\u00a0 A coastal mountain range, the Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica, prevents any maritime influence.\u00a0 Rainfall is low, soils are mostly thin and poor, with more clay and mineral around the rivers that flow through the area.\u00a0 And the region\u2019s most prestigious winegrowing districts are in the Duero Valley, near the river that becomes the Douro on the other side of the Portuguese border.\u00a0 This is Tempranillo country, although the grape is known locally as Tinto Fino, Tinto del Pais, or Tinto de Toro.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/5\/2\/600_446748466.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be trying wines from six appellations.<\/p> <p><i>Rueda: <\/i>\u00a0This is one of the few Spanish wine regions that are best known for superior white wines.\u00a0 Sherry-like fortified wines once dominated here, based on the Palomino grape, but in the 1970s, Rioja\u2019s Bodegas Marques de Riscal saw the potential for dry unfortified white wines using the aromatic, fruity varietal Verdejo, which now accounts for 90 percent of production.\u00a0 Cool nights help preserve the wine\u2019s fresh acidity in this otherwise hot region.\u00a0 Much of the Verdejo is unoaked, preserving the wine\u2019s fruit-forward qualities, but some producers are now employing barrel fermentation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying two Rueda Verdejos, one unoaked and made from an almost-extinct Verdejo clone, and a notably oaky barrel-fermented example.\u00a0 It will be interesting to see which production method better complements the grape\u2019s qualities.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Toro:<\/i>\u00a0 Just west of Rueda and 40 miles east of the Portuguese border lies Toro, named after a town of the same name.\u00a0 It seems appropriate that the local wines, powerful reds based on the local Tempranillo strain, Tinta de Toro, call to mind the image of a bull.\u00a0 The hot continental climate means that these grapes achieve high potential alcohol, so local authorities put a 15 percent cap on alcohol content for Toro wines.\u00a0 The prestige of the region has been enhanced by investment by well-known winemakers from outside the area, such as Ribera del Duero\u2019s Vega Sicilia.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Toro made by a former Vega Sicilia winemaker from old-vines ungrafted Tinta de Toro.\u00a0 Judicious use of French oak preserves the wine\u2019s elegance and character.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Tierra del Vino de Zamora:\u00a0 <\/i>West of Toro lies Tierra del Vino de Zamora, a new appellation that acquired DO status in 2008.\u00a0 It shares the climatic characteristics of Toro, but grows a greater variety of grapes\u2014Malvasia, Godello, Verdejo, Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Cabernet Sauvignon, among others.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Tempranillo still dominates.\u00a0 The most prestigious maker in the region is Bodega Vi\u00f1as del Cenit, and we will be trying their 2009 Via Cenit, made organically with old-vines Tempranillo (some over 100 years old), and matured in French oak.<\/p> <p><i>Cigales:<\/i> East of Toro lies Cigales, another relatively new appellation that lies at a higher altitude than its western neighbor.\u00a0 This is a relatively undeveloped region, which has the advantage of preserving traditional viticultural methods and old vines.\u00a0 Tempranillo (aka Tinta del Pais) dominates.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a wine made by Rioja\u2019s Baron de Ley at their Cigales winery, Finca Museum, where their goal is to make high-quality, value-priced wines from old-vines Tempranillo.<\/p> <p><i>Ribera del Duero:<\/i>\u00a0 This is the most important and prestigious region within Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\u00a0 A relatively young DO (established in 1982), it now rivals Rioja as the most prestigious producer of Spanish red wines.\u00a0 As the name suggests, the region straddles the Duero River, which provides a much-needed water supply and a limestone, chalk, and clay topsoil that adds complexity to the wines.\u00a0 The star producer of the region is Vega Sicilia, whose flagship Unico wine is like the Spanish equivalent of a Bordeaux first growth.\u00a0 Tempranillo must make up at least 75 percent of Ribera del Duero wine, with Bordeaux varietals usually used for blending.\u00a0 Our Ribera del Duero comes from Hacienda Monasterio, where the resident winemaker is Danish enologist Peter Sisseck, who founded Pingus, another benchmark wine for the region.\u00a0 Hacienda Monasterio represents unusual value for top-quality Ribera del Duero.<\/p> <p><i>Sardon del Duero:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a contiguous region to the west of Ribera del Duero that shares the same geographic and climatic conditions.\u00a0 The biggest name in the region is Abadia Retuerta, an ultramodern winery that maintains high quality standards for its Tempranillo wines despite large-volume production.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying their 2010 Selecci\u00f3n Especial.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be dining on the Upper West Side for the first time, at The Milling Room on Columbus.\u00a0 <b><i>Note earlier starting

<p><b>2014 Javier Sanz V Malcorta (Rueda)\u00a0 $23<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 90<\/i> \u2013 Produced with an old Verdejo clone called \u201cmalcorta,\u201d the 2014 V Malcorta has some tropical aromas of pineapple intermixed with more serious aromas of hay and straw, over a core of white fruit. The palate is intense with a combination of pineapple and leesy flavors, as it was matured in contact with the lees with <i>b\u00e2ttonage<\/i> for some four months before bottling.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Naia Naiades (Rueda)\u00a0 $26<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16\/20<\/i> \u2013 Creamy, rich, super-smooth. Good persistence and fruit purity, though quite reliant on caramel oak for complexity.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Bodegas y Vi\u00f1edos Maurodos San Roman (Toro)\u00a0 $30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 92<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 San Roman, is year in, year out, one of the most reliable wines of the appellation, pure Tempranillo (locally known as Tinta de Toro), the fruit from over 35-year-old, ungrafted and head-pruned vineyards planted on sandy, stony soils rich in clay in different villages across the Toro appellation. The wine aged for two years in French and American oak barrels, 80% of which were new. It\u2019s an earthy wine with plenty of dark aromas of peat, fountain pen ink, graphite, and tar, with very ripe fruit, black and blue berries. The palate is quite full-bodied, with abundant but fine tannins and enough acidity and persistence. A Toro with character.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 93<\/i> \u2013 Black plum, coffee, and mineral notes show depth and richness in this plush, firm red, with plenty of structure. Balanced and harmonious, ending with an alluring floral finish.<\/p> <p><b>2009 Vi\u00f1as del Cenit Via Cenit (Tierra del Vino de Zamora)\u00a0 $30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 100% Tempranillo.\u00a0 The 2009 Via Cenit spent 12 months in French oak. It is purple\/black in color with an impressive aromatic display of <i>pain grill\u00e9,<\/i> pencil lead, violets, incense, and blackberry. Full-bodied, structured, dense, and mouth-filling, it has the stuffing to evolve for 3-4 years and will provide pleasure through 2024 if not longer. Savory, ripe, and lengthy, it admirably reflects the superb conditions presented by the 2009 vintage.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Bodegas Museum Vinea Tempranillo Crianza (Cigales)\u00a0 $16<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 88<\/i> \u2013 The 2010 Vinea Tempranillo Crianza sees 15 months in oak barrel (60% American and 40% French) and is bottled unfiltered. It offers a generous, clean, sumptuous bouquet of dark plum, blueberry, mulberry, and mocha that displays good intensity. The palate is medium bodied with a soft, rounded entry. There is decent weight here for a Crianza, but it never tries to be overly ambitious. Rather, it aims for the \u201cdrinkability jugular\u201d with its soft, caressing tannins and rich dark plum and mocha-tinged finish. This is well-crafted and epitomizes the kind of Spanish wine that gets finished to the bottom of the bottle.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Abadia Retuerta Selecci\u00f3n Especial (Sard\u00f3n del Duero)\u00a0 $28<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 92<\/i> \u2013 This red shows a smooth texture that masks the firm structure, with well-integrated tannins and bright acidity supporting focused flavors of cherry, berry, mineral, and loam. Balanced, graceful, and deep. Tempranillo, Syrah, and Cabernet Sauvignon.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17.5\/20<\/i> \u2013 75% Tempranillo, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Syrah. 16 months in French and American oak. Excellent winemaking. Intense ripe black fruits, mint notes and nutmeg touch. High-tech palate, providing creamy texture with sweet and caramelized tannins. Confected but seductive mid body with great balance. Super consistent and reliable for a production of 550,000 bottles.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2010 Hacienda Monasterio Reserva (Ribera del Duero)\u00a0 $64<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 95<\/i> \u2013 The 2010 Reserva contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon from selected plots from their slope vineyards planted 25 years ago on chalk-rich soils that fermented with indigenous yeasts. 2010 was a near-perfect growing season, producing wines that are both powerful and fresh and that should have a long life in bottle. The nose is fragrant and elegant, mixing notes of red and black fruit with a sense of extreme harmony. Very showy. As much as it\u2019s elegant it also feels powerful and serious, quite Ribera, with good typicity. The palate is medium to full-bodied, with polished tannins, and is supple and tasty and with great acidity and length. A balanced, elegant vintage, not showy or voluptuous, but more serious and developing complexity. A fine and elegant Ribera. Bravo! At this quality level this represents very good value.<\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 94<\/i> \u2013 This big red offers both polish and density, with muscular, well-integrated tannins supporting the rich texture. The flavors are more harmonious than expressive, with plum, licorice, tar, mineral and coffee notes. Impressive structure.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Note earlier start time\u20146:30 PM","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group\/events\/228769419\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Castilla y Le\u00f3n","id":"228769419","time":1456270200000,"updated":1456340760000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432265288000,"name":"NYC Gay Men's Wine Dinner Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18616490,"urlname":"NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":8,"distance":6.75958156586,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427229111000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Book Description:<br\/>This stunning, exquisitely written collection introduces a cast of remarkable characters whose lives intersect in ways both life-affirming and heartbreaking.

Both a literary and cinematic symbol, Lampedusa has become not only the center of a modern human tragedy where the makeshift boats of African migrants end their desperate course, but also the new face of an inhospitable Europe.<br\/><b> The stories in Tales of Two Cities<\/b> mix fiction and reportage to convey the indignities and heartbreak, the callousness and solidarity, of living side-by-side with people who have a stupefyingly different income. Eschewing more direct sociological or economic analysis, the pieces here focus on the human dimension of penury and profligacy coexisting in the tightest of quarters. With writing that will move the reader, not just emotionally but perhaps, too, to action, this anthology gives life to the meaning of those words[it\u2019s not clear which words] in the streets and buildings of the metropolis.<\/p> <p><b>In English.

This Program is a three (3) month crash course that consists of a total of 72 program hours; three (3) hours per class session, twice a week, ending with a culminating event.<\/p> <p>Month One: The Fundamentals of Film-making. Students will learn about film genres, production, directing, character development, etc.<\/p> <p>Month Two: Forming a Film Crew. Students will learn about field production. We suggest dividing the students (we expect there will 15 students in total) into 3 groups of 5. Each group will pick a fictitious name for their film crew\/production company and then vote on assignment of crew responsibilities (director, producer\/writer, writer, camera, sound &amp; editor). Each film crew will pick a film genre (comedy, drama, documentary, etc.) and then create a 30 minute short film that relates to IMMIGRATION and\/or the social impact of it, or a story about their personal\/family experiences as immigrants.<\/p> <p>Month Three: Making the film. Students will shoot and edit their short films. After completion, the 3 films will be shared with the entire class and a respected film critic to be viewed, discussed\/critiqued, and judged. The course will culminate in an event that will double as a mini-Film Festival on immigration. Family, friends, other filmmakers, and the public will be invited to this screening, where all three films will be shown, followed by a Q &amp; A to be conducted by the students.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blacktvandfilmcollective\/events\/228955187\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Free Film Class Opportunity","id":"228955187","time":1456272000000,"updated":1456284871000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435088912000,"name":"The Black TV and Film Collective","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18693982,"urlname":"blacktvandfilmcollective","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Storytellers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"online","name":"online","lon":-73.94416,"id":24374762,"state":"NY","lat":40.678177,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.52385520935,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455784561000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Startup Grind\u2019s Global Conference is bringing together 3k Founders, Investors, and Startup Enthusiasts for the most valuable tech event of 2016.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Much older than Valentine\u2019s day, Dragobete is a celebration of love and fertility. The energy associated with it, is the kind necessary to bring love in one\u2019s life and in that sense, Dragobete is a god of love. Even to this day the belief in the Dragobete as a godly spirit still rest within the folklore of the region,most likely passed down from Dacian believes, even if time mixed the ancient tradition and rituals with the more recent Christian religious believes associated with the Finding the head of St. John the Baptist holiday. The most important thing is that the tradition and it\u2019s energy survived to this day with little change from the old times.<br\/>Dragobete is celebrated on February 24, a day when nature itself shows it\u2019s signs of love. It is the day when birds start mating and snowdrops, the first flowers of spring, delight us with their presence.<\/p> <p>The origin of the word Dragobete is controversial. One hypothesis that matches the believes of people inhabiting the lands more than 2000 years ago states that the word Dragobete derives from the Dacian words Trago \u2013 \u201cbuck\u201d or \u201cbilly goat\u201d and bete \u2013 feet ( pedes in Latin ) . Having lost if the Dacian language , Trago became Drago and Pede \u2013 bete( as they call the narrow woven strips for lady\u2019s girdle ) . The goat symbolizes the power of procreation , life force , fecundity.<\/p> <p>Drag, the root of the word Dragobete exists in other Indo-European languages \u200b\u200b, for example, the Latvian ,, dargts \u201d in the old Prussian dear ,, \u201d ,, Dargel \u201d in Irish ,, dir \u201cin English ,, dear \u201d etc. Many researchers believe that these words come from a Proto-Indo -European root : dhegu ,, heat .<\/p> <p>Because of her bloodline and initiations, Rox can tap into the energy of Dragobete and bring it to places far from Romania. This year, for the first time, because of the numerous request for help with love matters received she decided to perform the powerful ritual at her place in the USA. The energy will be brought forth and then distributed to all those requesting it. If you want to be the beneficiary of such life transforming energy, please let us know. Your presence to the ritual is not required, but tips of what to do to receive the full strength of this energy in your own place will be provided.<\/p> <p>The price for this event is $15, payable by clicking the \u201cDonate\u201d button on the pathtolight.net website.

Future meetings will have more structure, but the purpose of this first meeting is to get a sense of where we all are, and what general topics are most of interest to us right now. We'll start by talking a little about the kind of work we each do, or want to do, and we may talk about goals for places we'd like to pitch in the coming year. If you can, come armed with one problem you're facing right now. It could be figuring out where to pitch an idea, or how to structure a pitch, or how to take a vague idea and hone it into something sharper. It could be trying out a different kind of writing, or it could be a specific reporting problem.<\/p> <p><br\/>Other topics potentially of interest for this or a future meeting: tips for brainstorming (I have a few, and I'd love to hear more); how to structure your day to tackle working from home and\/or working on multiple projects; and swapping stories about cold pitches. We may discuss tips for writers starting out, or coming back to writing after a hiatus, or trying to break into a new kind of outlet. Other topics of interest, possibly, for some point down the road: networking; writing\/reporting on spec; tackling isolation; balancing the kind of writing you want to do with writing that pays (more of) the bills. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a safe and supportive group. We'll strive to help each other.

It involves a fundamental shift in the way application logic is written from imperative to non-blocking.

We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 7 and 15 mini dates each lasting between four and eight minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>Get Your Tickets At: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-tagine-nyc.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-tagine-nyc.html<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/600_444658593.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>* There is a one drink minimum at the event.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 7 and 15 mini dates each lasting between four and eight minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>Get Your Tickets At: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-tagine-nyc.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-tagine-nyc.html<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickmixers.com\/speed-dating-in-nyc.html\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/e\/1\/600_444658593.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>* There is a one drink minimum at the event.

What was once a buzzy food just in big cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco is now popping up all over the country, including cities such as Philadelphia, Austin, and San Diego. Blame Momofuku\u2019s noodley overlord David Chang, perhaps: it\u2019s certainly no coincidence that a good number of the new ramen restaurants mimic the sleek wood aesthetic of his landmark New York restaurant Noodle Bar, and the ramen trend has only intensified after the first, ramen-themed first issue of Chang\u2019s Lucky Peach was released in 2011.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe aim to serve ramen that embraces a whole meal in one bowl,\u201d explains Mr. Okayama about the spirit behind their ramen. Zen 6 really expands the concept of ramen and elevates this cuisine to the next level. It\u2019s a ramen shop for the next generation.<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/zen6ny.com\/our-menu\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/zen6ny.com\/our-menu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/zen6ny.com\/our-menu\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>FOOD PORN:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Ramen Burger?

Fried garlic and house-made maayu (roasted garlic oil) add extra body and nuttiness to the spicy soup and conventional tan tan men meat sauce while an abundance of fresh vegetables balances out the layering flavors.

Inspired by the famous Ippudo tonkotsu ramen, Zen 6 has perfected their soup with a milder and smoother taste that goes well with their original maayu.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/tastyislandhawaii.com\/images09\/gomatei_shoyunoodle.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Spider Ramen: Oversized soft shell crab sitting on the ramen brings a happy feeling to your stomach and taste buds.

The curry flavor is reserved to highlight their chicken base broth and is just enough to add an energizing aroma and a kick to the dish. Medium thick straight noodles absorb the soup well, and crisp, fresh bean sprouts and scallions display comfortable harmony with the original meat paste.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/CvOoNf2tmR1LJutQr804RA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Dining Room<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/pUmiuk8AjTI3To_wq7NyIw\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The Bar<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/3hl_7jW9viAk-TvVcGu50g\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/zen-6-new-york\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/zen-6-new-york\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/zen-6-new-york<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><br\/>When you RSVP \"Yes\" to an event, or participate in an event, please understand that you are responsible for your own safety and well-being, and will hold no one else liable in case of personal injury or any mishap.

Feng Ying, renowned ballerina and Artistic Director of the National Ballet of China. She will speak about this renowned danced company and the evolution of ballet in China, touching on the differing styles and how the company\u00b9s storied traditions continue to develop in the present day, with dancers from the company demonstrating key points.<\/p> <p>Perhaps best known to American audiences as the dance company that performed for President Nixon on his historic visit to China in 1972, The National Ballet of China has achieved a well-earned reputation as a truly world-class dance company. The company is distinguished by its spectacular performances of imaginative new ballets and phenomenal interpretations of traditional masterworks from the classical repertoire. Its unique style, imbuing characteristics of its Russian training and techniques picked up from Western counterparts with a distinctly Chinese flair, presents an unforgettable spectacle to its audiences.<\/p> <p>Founded in December 1959, The National Ballet of China fuses classical and modern styles to present works bearing its distinct national characteristics. Schooled in the Russian tradition, the company is known worldwide for its adaptations of Western classics including Swan Lake, Don Quixote, and Giselle, as well as original ballets including The Red Detachment of Women, Raise the Red Lantern, The Peony Pavilion, and The Crane Calling. As a dance company renowned for the quality of its performances on the international stage, The National Ballet of China serves as a cultural envoy from the Chinese people to the world.<\/p> <p>For questions or to register by phone, please contact Aaron Nicholson at[masked] ext. 138 or by email at &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/5\/d\/600_446900829.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Chinese-Language-Culture-Business-Meetup\/events\/228871556\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Ballet in China: From Swan Lake to \u201cRed\u201d Ballets","id":"228871556","time":1456356600000,"updated":1456364177000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444232043000,"name":"New York Chinese Language & Culture & Business Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19004962,"urlname":"New-York-Chinese-Language-Culture-Business-Meetup","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"150 Broadway, 20th Floor","name":"NYI\/LMHQ","lon":-74.010094,"id":24304389,"state":"NY","lat":40.709183,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":150,"headcount":0,"distance":3.01620221138,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454291111000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join the fine folks from NYI, Datadog, and Deis for an evening of containers on NYI bare metal!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Kent Rancourt, core contributor for Deis, will discuss the next version of the Open Source Deis platform and how it can help you get your apps up and running in containers.
