The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold. Students of all levels are welcome. We will start with chapter I and we will study a few of the early lessons in the Workbook. Class is free, but suggested donation is $10 since both Lyna and Caf\u00e9 72 are lovingly donating the time and space. ABSOLUTELY no outside food or drink are allowed.

Patience is the level of endurance one can take before negativity.<\/p> <p>Patience involves the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, or a more valuable reward in the long-term. When given a choice, all animals, humans included, are inclined to favor short-term rewards over long-term rewards. This is despite the often greater benefits associated with long-term rewards.<\/p> <p><i>Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37<\/i>, one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism, suggests patience is necessary for an ethical life and one's long term happiness, even if patience is sometimes difficult in the short term. Some of the verse excerpts from this book are: \"our conduct must always foster forbearance\"; \"one must patiently endure rude remarks, because it delivers us to purity\"; \"if we are unjustly wronged by others, it is best to conquer our hurt with patience, accept suffering, and refrain from unrighteous retaliation\"; \"it is good to patiently endure injuries done to you, but to forget them is even better.<\/p> <p>The Buddhist concept of patience is distinct from the English definition of the word. In Buddhism, patience refers to not returning harm, rather than merely enduring a difficult situation. It is the ability to control one's emotions even when being criticized or attacked.<\/p> <p>Here are some quotes on the subject of patience:<\/p> <p>\"One minute of patience, ten years of peace.\" ~ Greek proverb<\/p> <p>\"A patient man is better than a warrior, and he who rules his temper, than he who takes a city.\" (Proverbs 16:32).<\/p> <p>\"Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.\" ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson<\/p> <p>One moment of patience may ward off great disaster. One moment of impatience may ruin a whole life.\" ~ Chinese Proverb<\/p> <p>\"Patience is not just about waiting for something\u2026 it\u2019s about how you wait, or your attitude while waiting.\" ~ Joyce Meyer<\/p> <p>\"Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.\" ~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau<\/p> <p>\"Our real blessings often appear to us in the shape of pains, losses and disappointments; but let us have patience and we soon shall see them in their proper figures.\" ~ Joseph Addison<\/p> <p>Let's discuss\u00a0patience and how it relates to self-control, long-term benefit vs. short-term reward, and acceptance (rather than rejection) of the situation at hand.<\/p> <p><b>$4 per person for meetup fees.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/West-Village-Dynamic-Discussions-Meetup\/events\/228125414\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Dinner and Discussion on...

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Our <b>Surf Challenge<\/b> is quickly approaching this June and I've come to realize that we have an even bigger challenge on our hands. A lot of you have expressed to me that you can't swim or don't swim that well. And you've expressed a desire to learn how to swim.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/0\/1\/600_445916321.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>It's no shocker that statistically People of color swim less that the general populace for many reasons. I was terrified of water too from a near drowning experience when I was young. I decided to face my fear 2 years ago and signed up for lessons and today it's thing of the past. So if you have this fear too, you should know you can definitely conquer it.<\/p> <p>Group swim is a hard thing to plan!

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) are different; they are the quintessential \u201coutside face,\u201d providing outside groups with the contract for interaction. In both technology and biology, internal mechanisms evolve; interfaces are conserved. If new and improved interfaces never supplant established interfaces, how can both new and improved interfaces continue to coexist? \u00a0Release is merely the first step of a gradual, painful, never-ending process. Complete replacement is never achieved. We will examine this issue and ways to avoid \"rebooting\" APIs.<\/p> <p>Even more fundamentally, there are a variety of issues which must be addressed when defining an API. Many teams bog down on questions of mere syntax (e.g... JSON vs. XML) rather than the far more fundamental questions of interface semantics (e.g., policy issues). In the long-term, questions of syntax have relatively little relevance. Questions of semantics (e.g., what constitutes a valid request, is a request proper, are there appropriate security and integrity measures) are far more critical.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Robert Gezelter<\/b><\/p> <p>has worked the design of protocols and interfaces since the late 1970's.

Yep, I'm addressing those of you---among our 200 members---who have yet to get personally involved since you \"signed up\" here with \"HCx3DP Meetup NY.\"\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is still our official name...even though we've invested the last seven or eight months in a key, innovative subset of \"HCx3DP...\" That is \"Health Maker Lab\"---HML, for short.<\/b><\/p> <p>Bear with me! In this update,\u00a0I'm going to present additional (compelling!!) reasons for you to commit more of your time and attention to HML. I think in many cases, your free-will commitment likely comes down---in the main---to the appeal of our evolving strategies. And, how---despite\u00a0this world full of so much choice---they complement your own interests .<\/p> <p>Fair enough. Since some of you joined our Meetup Community, we HAVE changed our targets and readjusted our focus. Health Maker Lab is BOTH broader and narrower than HCx3DP.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Broader in that we've expanded \"3DP\" to Digital Fabrication---or, DigiFab. You know as well as I that tech of every kind is evolving at lightning speed. 3D Printing is an important subset of DigiFab---especially when applied to Healthcare solutions. BUT, there are effective ways and means beyond 3DP to deliver those novel and necessary answers. Especially if we're thinking \"Big Tent.\"<\/p> <p>Narrower in that we've\u00a0drilling down to determine the most effective of our ultimate HML solutions. Those solutions that will best meet the needs of specific patient, client or recipient communities for improved health---in a larger compass of that phrase. From our HML Community to the larger local community by narrowing our \"envisioning\" to integrate appropriate solutions. Even if they are NOT the traditional modes of \"modern\" medicine.<\/p> <p><b><i>Big Tent---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Now---as this post's title suggests---our HML operational strategy includes putting up a Big Tent and inviting disparate interests (yours!) to enter in expectation and join in our convocation successfully. At this point, we will be hard put to keep our internal HML Action Centers to eight or 10. And, to address the needs of \"only\" five or six external neighborhood partner or player populations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Internally, diverse Action Centers will promote the cross-pollination of new and novel ideas. Leading to what we hope are effective hybrid solutions in Healthcare.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Externally, serving the varied needs of sometimes competing neighborhood interest groups and organizations (\"Hood Hubs!\") WILL add to the complexity of our interfaces, relationships and connections. Human interactions ARE usually \"messy.\" (As Miss Frizzle of \"The Magic School Bus\" admonishes those who would produce scientific creativity: \"Take chances; make mistakes; get messy.\") We will have to inform our out-facing perspectives with common-good POVs commonly shared.<\/p> <p><b><i>GeoPrint---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our HML \"action footprint\" on the maps of our overlapping communities---our GeoPrint---are likely to be rather fluid. Especially to start. The interests of our HML Community, donors and partners and Healthcare recipients will ensure some curious GeoPrint \"gerrymandering.\" At least until we can rationalize our efforts---from (eventually) adequate resources.<\/p> <p>Our startup GeoPrint will (likely!) center in Brooklyn---the \"Techreative\" Borough. Our initial home-base will (likely!) reside in the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT). That's DUMBO (the City's official \"Digital District\"), the Brooklyn Navy Yard (335 tech-driven startups and ramp-ups) and Downtown Brooklyn (14 higher ed institutions and 60K students). A rich stew of assets that will help us to launch successfully. (I've lived and worked in Brooklyn for over 35 years and I can vouch for its base of resources---in our pursuit of a new kind of Health.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>From the BTT, we'll (likely!) spread in Brownstone and Riparian (East River) BK and east into UltraUrban East New York and Brownsville. Neighborhoods of high health needs. NYC enjoys 55 major Healthcare facilities. The self-selected among these will act as our first\u00a0Hood Hubs\u00a0among equals. We are---after all---focused on Health and hospitals strive to deliver that uncommon commodity.<\/p> <p>Donors and partners---action resources---may drive the expansion of our GeoPrint in unpredictable directions. It is possible that interested players in northern New Jersey could influence our development there---before, say, The Bronx or Staten Island. Certainly, the TriState Region is a natural GeoPrint extension for HML. After that...the world?!!<\/p> <p><b><i>Viral Ecosystem---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Health Maker Lab is intent on prototyping its inspirations, ideas and innovations in an initial \"sandbox\" location. We'll play with the combinations that fascinate and foster the most promising solutions to diverse needs. The most \u00a0certain possibilities are the certainty of the unexpected.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As an antidote to negative results, we will call on our Advisory Council (eventually 15 in number) of proven players. These advisors---the bases for our Action Centers---will keep us progressing appropriately to a stable ecosystem at our first HML location.<\/p> <p>At that breakout point, we envision a kind of viral HML \"reproduction\" regimen will commence. Successful ways and means, models and modes and---most importantly---trained and experienced cadre will empower rapid growth (likely?) within New York City.<\/p> <p><b>+++<\/b><\/p> <p>These expectations will indeed require good people to achieve.

(This is the coveted class that enables donors to HML to take tax advantage of their donations.) Where NYState process took weeks, the IRS is likely to take months.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Fortunately, my Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez is the Ranking Democratic Member of the Small Business Committee of the House of Representatives. I've recently participated in a roundtable on Federal \"grantsmanship\" organized by Ms. Velazquez.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

They are opening a <b>third location<\/b> on East 24th Street right next to the New York Comedy Club. <b>This new location has not been advertised to the general public and is having a \"soft opening\" that few people know about. This location has a limited menu, and as is the case with all V Spot locations, it is 100% vegan!<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>I am a one of their huge fans, as are many of our group members, so <b>let's be among the very first to check them out at the new V Spot location!

You can join by going to: meetup.com\/House-Blend-Graphic-Novel-Book-Club<br\/>As for location, we'll be rotating between The Bellmore Bean coffeeshop, Panera Bread, and the Library (all located in Bellmore, NY), but no matter where we are, there will be coffee, and nibbles to enjoy during the discussion (and -- bonus! -- they'll be free when we meet at the Library).<\/p> <p>We'll also have graphic novel raffles for folks who RSVP through Meet-Up or the Library's website. So let us know that you're coming and you may walk away with more than just coffee and the joy that comes with great conversation!<br\/>Join us at our next meeting on January 26th (see info below) to help shape the club's schedule and choose the books we'll be reading in the future.

She has a gallery show of her art, a satisfying job, and a good guy she plans to marry. The culture she grew up in seems very far away\u2014until she gets a phone call that changes her life. Returning to Japan, Yumiko feels caught between eastern and western cultures, between being an adult and a child, and between her past and her future. In Level Up we meet first-generation American, Dennis, who is trying to fulfill his immigrant parents' dreams by walking away from his own. As he tries to balance staying true to himself with the responsibility he feels towards his family, he faces his greatest crisis of conscience -- who exactly is he? We'll look at how these characters navigate the changing nature of their lives, and explore how all of us figure out who we are, where we belong, and what values we hold dear.<\/p> <p>Pick up a copy of both books at the Bellmore Library, just ask for them at the Circulation Desk and mention that you're with the House Blend Graphic Novel Club.

We offer members the opportunity to share ideas, contacts and most importantly, business referrals. \u00a0Check out to see if your profession is currently taken at the following link: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bninewjersey.com\/chapterdetails.php?chapterId=1636&amp;t=db3907f9cf60c71add464fcce0eddcfde87cc619cfe76e34c4aa5cb439f60347&amp;name=BNI%20BNI%20Crossroads\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bninewjersey.com\/chapterdetails.php?chapterId=1636&amp;t=db3907f9cf60c71add464fcce0eddcfde87cc619cfe76e34c4aa5cb439f60347&amp;name=BNI%20BNI%20Crossroads\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bninewjersey.com\/chapterdetails.php?chapterId=1636&amp;t=db3907f9cf60c71add464fcce0eddcfde87cc619cfe76e34c4aa5cb439f60347&amp;name=BNI%20BNI%20Crossroads<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you or\u00a0 someone you know\u00a0 are looking to increase your sales and your sales force, we have plenty of leads to give out.\u00a0 Check us out on\u00a0January 27th\u00a0and enjoy\u00a0 breakfast on us.<\/p> <p>Email with questions or for more information.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BNI-Crossroads-Paramus-Business-Networking-Meetup\/events\/228345480\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"BNI Crossroads Breakfast & Networking..Come and bring your business Cards","id":"228345480","time":1453896000000,"updated":1453908588000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1406243334000,"name":"BNI Crossroads Paramus Business Networking","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":15953402,"urlname":"BNI-Crossroads-Paramus-Business-Networking-Meetup","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Business Networkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07661","country":"us","city":"River Edge","phone":"201-262-4976","address_1":"516 Kinderkamack Road","name":"River Edge Diner","lon":-74.033866,"id":902573,"state":"NJ","lat":40.925086,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.3377809525,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452464466000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Begin growing your business this week! \u00a0Check our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BergenCountyLetip\/pages\/Closed_Categories\/\">Closed Category List<\/a>, if your business isn't on that list then join one of our weekly meetups and come enjoy a complimentary breakfast while networking with other business professionals. \u00a0We look forward to meeting you!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.letipofbergencounty.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BergenCountyLetip\/events\/228068497\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Weekly Networking Meeting","id":"ptnrnlyvcbkc","time":1453896000000,"updated":1453908577000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452457224000,"name":"LeTip of Bergen County","group_lon":-74.0400009155,"id":19315743,"urlname":"BergenCountyLetip","group_lat":40.9300003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":23.0565395355,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1401905707000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>LeTip of Parsippany<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Grow Your Business and Join us for a Complimentary Breakfast<br\/>Wednesday Mornings 7:15 am \u2013 8:30 am<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Marriott Hotel<br\/>1401 Route 10 East \u2022 Whippany, New Jersey 07981<\/b><\/p> <p>Remember to bring at least 20 business cards.<\/p> <p>To find out more about LeTip of Parsippany, please visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/parsippanyletip.com\/\">website.<\/a><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Marriott Hotel 1401 Route 10 East \u2022 Whippany, New Jersey 07981 - in the back of the restaurant","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LeTip-of-Parsippany-Business-Referral-Networking-Group\/events\/227855845\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":4500000,"name":"Join us for a free Breakfast and see how we help each other grow our businesses!","id":"drfxrjyvcbkc","time":1453896900000,"updated":1453902238000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1400596434000,"name":"LeTip of Parsippany, Business Referral & Networking Group","group_lon":-74.4199981689,"id":14567982,"urlname":"LeTip-of-Parsippany-Business-Referral-Networking-Group","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07607","country":"us","city":"maywood","address_1":"92 West Pleasant Avenue, Maywood, NJ","name":"maywood pancake house","lon":-74.064041,"id":13690012,"state":"NJ","lat":40.905235,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.4260911942,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427308909000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You may have attended networking group meetings before, but you haven\u2019t seen ours! \u00a0We are a growing chapter that maintains a unique sense of partnership as well as camaraderie.

In true to the concept of adapting to 2016, we will be filming the event in 360 virtual reality and give a brief lesson on how to film content in VR with 360Fly. The event will be divided into three major parts.<\/p> <p>1. Funding and Regulation for Startups- the focus will be about SEC Title 3 Crowdfunding regulations, which are going to allow for the creation of equity crowdfunding platforms. Speaker is Liberty McAteer<\/p> <p>2. Social Media and Marketing- this will identify the growth and popularity of live streaming platforms like Periscope and Meerkat for marketing. Speaker is Vin Nolan who is a Periscope influencer and was a headliner at the 2016 Periscope Summit.<\/p> <p>3. New Industries- This will be a discussion about how the release of Oculus, HTC Vive, and Playstation VR will create a new VR industry in the same capacity like the iPhone release in 2007 created a new eco-system for startups in mobile. While also understanding how it can be a disruptive force in already established industries.
