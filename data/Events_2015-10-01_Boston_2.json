We believe that we will be able to successfully manipulate this consideration in the meetup system to keep the meetings all on the Thursday evening before expiration Friday. If you see a meeting time that isn't the Thursday evening before expiration Friday, please let us know and we will correct it. Thank you.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Mary Lou will have a little red Boston Traders meetup table sign.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonTraders\/events\/224018607\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Options Monthly Meeting for Boston Traders Meetup","id":"qtfntjytmbwb","time":1442527200000,"updated":1442536146000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1201548457000,"name":"Boston Traders Meetup to Teach\/Learn Trading Strategies","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":981165,"urlname":"BostonTraders","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Traders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02124","country":"us","city":"Dorchester","address_1":"80 Talbot  Ave","name":"The Carver Den","lon":-71.083761,"id":836082,"state":"MA","lat":42.293667,"repinned":false},"headcount":31,"distance":4.64612483978,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421030072000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/b\/600_433261547.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake The\u00a0 8 Steps That Will Change Your Life<\/p> <p>The Original Steppers of Boston has earned two\u00a0 Steppin' Instruction Certifications**.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Every Thursday<\/p> <p>Classes - Practice - Open Dance<\/p> <p>Beginners Welcome!!<br\/>Men, Women, Singles, Couples<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Instructional Hours:<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Beginners Class 6pm -7pm<\/p> <p>Everyone Else Class 7pm-8pm<\/p> <p><br\/>Open Dance &amp; Practice 8pm - Until<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Original Steppers of Boston offer Certified Chicago Style Steppin' dance instruction for the new beginner to the seasoned stepper.

We aim to have reoccurring sessions moving forward so we can stay abreast of these issues both as individuals and together as a community. We have seen a huge surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, politicians and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas.

An elegant thrusting weapon it teaches the fighter to use the thrust and make small parries. The smallsword is the immediate predecessor to modern epee.<\/p> <p>The class covers all the basics of footwork, attacks and defenses.

I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed.

Just read a real estate investing book<br\/>b. Attended your first seminar<br\/>c. Watched a late night infomercial<br\/>d. Listened to a webinar<\/p> <p>And You:<\/p> <p>a. Were told real estate is the fastest way to make money<br\/>b. Are convinced that you will be able to leave the job that you hate within the next 2 weeks<br\/>c. Thought about or have already paid $20,000 for a coaching program<\/p> <p>But You:<\/p> <p>a. Don't know what to do next<br\/>b. Were told by someone that it would never work<br\/>c. Are losing your confidence rapidly<\/p> <p>Don't be embarrassed. Every person that got into real estate that wasn't hand held by a family member and grew up in the business started out the same way. 90 percent or more of those who have gotten excited about real estate never ended up even trying. Thinking big, attracting money, and being in control of your own destiny sound good, especially when a polished salesperson is the one painting the picture. The reality is: Real Estate is a business and it is hard work. The only people who will tell you otherwise are trying to sell you something(seminar, a coaching program, a book, a subscription). That's the bad news.<\/p> <p>The good news is that there are a ton of easy steps that you can take in order to start moving in the right direction without doing anything drastic. And, if you put in the work, the results will come. On this webinar, Tom Cafarella of Ocean City Development, will discuss:<\/p> <p>1. Why real estate is the toughest industry to get into<br\/>2. How it can be the best industry to be in once you have momentum<br\/>3. Steps that you can take this week to start your real estate career<br\/>4. The basics of wholesaling<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0 Our training program that allows you inside access to our exact marketing programs that you can use to find deals to wholesale<\/p> <p>Tom is a principle of Ocean City Development and is head of acquisitions for the company. Tom has been on the front lines of Ocean City Development's team, and has helped his team to acquire over 34 properties in the past 6 months including both fix and flip and buy and hold transactions.<\/p> <p>To sign up, please go to:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/ewebinars.com\/webinar\/?trackingID1=XXXXXXXX&amp;trackingID2=YYYYYYYYY&amp;landingpage=default&amp;expiration=default&amp;memberid=9778&amp;webid=jlppjxwrep&lt;a\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/ewebinars.com\/webinar\/?trackingID1=XXXXXXXX&amp;trackingID2=YYYYYYYYY&amp;landingpage=default&amp;expiration=default&amp;memberid=9778&amp;webid=jlppjxwrep&lt;a<\/a> href=\"https:\/\/attendee.gotowebinar.com\/register\/5474109221069365505\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Online","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/turningagentsintoentrepreneurs\/events\/225193448\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":5400000,"name":"Getting Started In Real Estate Investing: Wholesaling Real Estate For Quick Cash","id":"225193448","time":1442530800000,"updated":1442538009000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1354571173000,"name":"Boston Real Estate Entrepreneurs","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":6100382,"urlname":"turningagentsintoentrepreneurs","group_lat":42.5,"who":"Real Estate Entrepreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02453","country":"us","city":"Waltham","phone":"781-893-1180","address_1":"731 Moody Street","name":"Shopper's Cafe Bar & Grille","lon":-71.238838,"id":1486084,"state":"MA","lat":42.363895,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.64174938202,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1411736856000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We'll run routes along the Charles River Greenway, Riverwalk, Newton and neighborhoods of Waltham, with options to extend for those who are looking to add distance (or end early!)\u00a0Afterward we'll hop into the bar for post-run drinks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We meet in front of Shoppers Cafe and leave at 7:00p.\u00a0There should be plenty of parking on the street and in the neighborhood.

Avoid this tragedy by wearing your thinking cap to this NSBF meeting, where Tony will provide examples of great elevator speeches (and examples of stinkers). You\u2019ll take time to think of three ways you help your customers, work in pairs to \u201cinterview\u201d others about your business stories, and then try out your brand-new 30-second introduction.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Tony Toledo has been telling stories in order to eat since 1990, and in fact bought his massive one-tenth-of-an-acre estate with his mouth. The Beverly, MA-based storyteller sells the idea of stories to school principals, who sell the idea of folktales to their teachers, who in turn sell \u201cThe Little Rooster and the Turkish Sultan\u201d to their students. Only when everybody is on board can magic happen. According to Tony, \u201cWe are all in sales no matter what business we are in. Knowing this\u00a0is the key\u00a0to success.\u201d For the past seven years, he hosted the weekly \u201cSpeak Up, the Spoken Word Open Mic\u201d in Lynn, MA.\u00a0Tony is also past president of LANES, the League for the Advancement of New England Storytelling, which recently honored him with the Brother Blue Storytelling Award.

Featured speaker and full-time storyteller Tony Toledo will lead an intensive workshop on how to set your \u201celevator speech\u201d on fire.

Cost for launch fees, parking, and trip are expected to be $50 per person.<\/p> <p>The start time is approximate. To attend this paddle, you need some experience camping and able to paddle for 3-4 hours. Weather can change during multi-day trips, so we might encounter adverse conditions (wind, waves) and you need to be able to handle this. To register, contact Rob Nardone ([masked]) and please include 2-4 places you have paddled the last few years, including location, distance, and conditions. Once registered, Rob will provide launch details and other needed info.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-AMC-Sea-Kayak-Meetup\/events\/225009622\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Casco Bay Kayak Camping Trip","id":"225009622","time":1442577600000,"updated":1442874342000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1417468034000,"name":"Boston AMC Sea Kayak","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18225875,"urlname":"Boston-AMC-Sea-Kayak-Meetup","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Paddlers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"      Cambridge  02142","address_1":"        1 Memorial Drive             ","name":"Microsoft NERD Center - Horace Mann Room","lon":-71.081322,"id":15826652,"state":"MA","lat":42.361538,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":2,"headcount":0,"distance":0.589030206203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1438639650000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostondatafest.com\/#big-data-innovation-day-friday-september-18th\">Big Data Innovation Day - Friday September 18th<\/a><\/p> <p><b> Big data is one of today\u2019s most exciting sectors, whether you are a software engineer, or a business executive.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Responding to the demands of African American activists that the United States go beyond civil rights to secure economic justice, Moynihan thought his analysis of black families highlighted socioeconomic inequality. However, the report's central argument that poor families headed by single mothers inhibited African American progress touched off a heated controversy. The long-running dispute over Moynihan's conclusions changed how Americans talk about race, the family, and poverty.<\/p> <p>Fifty years after its publication, the Moynihan Report remains a touchstone in contemporary racial politics, cited by President Barack Obama and Congressman Paul Ryan among others.Beyond Civil Rights\u00a0offers the definitive history of the Moynihan Report controversy. Focusing on competing interpretations of the report from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, Geary demonstrates its significance for liberals, conservatives, neoconservatives, civil rights leaders, Black Power activists, and feminists. He also illustrates the pitfalls of discussing racial inequality primarily in terms of family structure.\u00a0Beyond Civil Rights\u00a0captures a watershed moment in American history that reveals the roots of current political divisions and the stakes of a public debate that has extended for decades.<\/p> <p><b>On\u00a0In Search of the Movement: The Struggle for Civil Rights Then and Now:<\/b> <b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>In March of 1965, Martin Luther King led thousands in an epic march from Selma, Alabama to the state capital in Montgomery, in what is often seen as the culminating moment of the Civil Rights movement. The Voting Rights Act was signed into law that year, and with Jim Crow eradicated, and schools being desegregated, the movement had supposedly come to an end. America would go on to record its story as an historic success.<\/p> <p>Recently, however, the\u00a0<i>New York Times<\/i>\u00a0featured an article that described the reversion of Little Rock's schools to all-black or all-white. The next day, the paper printed a story about a small town in Alabama where African Americans were being denied access to the polls. Massive demonstrations in cities across the country protest the killing of black men by police, while we celebrate a series of 50th-anniversary commemorations of the signature events of the Civil Rights movement. In such a time it is important to ask: In the last fifty years, has America progressed on matters of race, or are we stalled--or even moving backward?<\/p> <p>With these questions in mind, Benjamin Hedin set out to look for the Civil Rights movement. \"I wanted to find the movement in its contemporary guise,\" he writes, \"which also meant answering the critical question of what happened to it after the 1960s.\" He profiles legendary figures, like John Lewis, Robert Moses, and Julian Bond, and also visits with contemporary leaders such as William Barber II and the staff of the Dream Defenders. But just as powerful--and instructional--are the stories of those whose work goes unrecorded, the organizers and teachers who make all the rest possible.<\/p> <p>In these pages the movement is portrayed as never before, as a vibrant tradition of activism that remains in our midst.\u00a0<i>In Search of the Movement<\/i>\u00a0is a fascinating meditation on the patterns of history, as well as an indelible look at the meaning and limits of American freedom.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Black-Book-Club\/events\/225210972\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Author Discussion:  Beyond Civil Rights: The Moynihan Report and Its Legacy","id":"225210972","time":1442602800000,"updated":1443275954000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355372043000,"name":"The Cambridge-Boston Black Book Club","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":6221992,"urlname":"Cambridge-Black-Book-Club","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Knowledge Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Somerville","address_1":"62 Bow St","name":"The Green Room","lon":-71.099228,"id":23542643,"lat":42.381496,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.10962414742,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440348809000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/7\/5\/600_441204693.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Let's Make Beats!\u00a0INTRO TO ELECTRONIC MUSIC PRODUCTION<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAn Ableton Live class for beginners<\/p> <p>Learn the fundamentals of electronic music production in Ableton Live.

It encourages the heart to remain open rather than to shut down in the face of pain and suffering \u2013 to remain at ease under all conditions. Loving-kindness cultivates a sense of good heartedness towards ourselves which then radiates outward engendering generosity and care for others happiness and well-being.

Each year, I spend 8 weeks in silence, working with various meditation techniques, accessing deep states of consciousness and expanded awareness. This work has led me to experience the transformative power of the awakened heart, resulting in the development of the Brahma Vihara workshops. The benefits I have received are innumerable and immeasurable. Nothing would please me more than to share what I have learned with others.<\/p> <p>For more information, go to: <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/whisperingdeermeditation\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/whisperingdeermeditation\/<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Upcoming Brahma Vihara workshops with Whispering Deer:<\/b><\/p> <p>October 23, 2015: Brahma Vihara - Karuna (Compassion)<\/p> <p>November 13, 2015: Brahma Vihara - Mudita (Appreciative Joy)<\/p> <p>November 20, 2015: Brahma Vihara - Upeka (Equanimity)<\/p> <p><br\/>**************************<\/p> <p><b>Most\u00a0ingredients are organic and of the highest standards.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Come be in community<\/b><\/p> <p><b>and enjoy the healthiest meal on planet earth!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Call (617)[masked] or e-mail <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/b> <b><br\/><\/b> <b>for reservations and directions.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please rsvp no later than noon on Friday.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sliding scale of $20 - $35\/meal.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>(Note: Preferred payment is by cash or check.)<\/b> <b><br\/><\/b> <b>(Let David know if interested in<\/b> <b>helping him cook in exchange for a free meal.

According to Abrams, all humans are hard-wired with what Carl Jung called a \u201cgod-capacity,\u201d prompting people throughout history to seek a higher power, as she did during her personal recovery experience, about which we'll hear. She conceives an 'emerging God' that can be seen as the guiding force of science. 'God,' she proposes, has emerged from our species, and is as real as the economy, the government, or the worldwide web, which are all emergent phenomena.<\/p> <p>We'll listen to both presentations and discuss these ideas as a way to come to grips with the power of religious belief, scientific conceptions of the Universe, and ways to promote humanism as we understand it.<\/p> <p>Pizza will be catered and include vegetarian and hopefully also vegan options.

No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society.

So I'm proposing that we do exactly that. Specifically, I am proposing we play a game of Here I Stand via e-mail.<\/p> <p>(Why Here I Stand and not Virgin Queen? Two reasons: 1) I have been a part of a couple of online HIS games, and I'm more comfortable using the online tools as a result, plus I am more familiar with what can go wrong, and 2) I haven't played HIS in quite a long time and I WANNA. So there.)<\/p> <p>What you'll need: - You'll need access to a computer. (Presumably, you're in good shape on that score.)<br\/>- You'll need to be in a position where you can check your mail a couple of times per day, especially during the diplomacy phase. The more you're able to check, the faster the game will go!<br\/>- You'll need to download a free program called \"CyberBoard\" which will enable you to record your moves on a shared board. This is a Windows program, but Mac users should have no trouble running it under BootCamp or other Windows emulation-y software. Likewise Linux users should be able to run it under Wine. If you have a Mac or Linux box and the last two sentences sounded like gibberish, you may need to sit this one out, though I'm happy to assist to the extent I can.<br\/>- You'll need to sign up for a site called ACTS. This is also free, and it will enable us to keep track of your cards, victory points, etc.<br\/>- You'll need to be willing (at least in theory) to stick with a game that might take quite some time -- if you're the sort whose attention span flops if your online TTA game takes more than two weeks, this probably won't be the thing for you.<\/p> <p>You do NOT need an encyclopedic understanding of the rules of Here I Stand (though it helps), or a similarly encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the 16th century Wars of Religion. This is going to be a learning game for some folks -- maybe lots of folks, so we're not going to put the pedal to the metal or be unforgiving of your little boo-boos. There's a lot to the game, but it's pretty amenable to learning as you go. If you have experience with games like Twilight Struggle, Successors, Labyrinth, Sword of Rome, etc., you'll have little trouble picking it up after a turn or two.<\/p> <p>In order to get the game going ASAP, I'll be assigning the six powers to people after everyone's signed up. Here I Stand's sides are very asymmetrically powerful, so you'll be playing a very different game depending on which side you're playing. A quick rundown of the powers:<\/p> <p>OTTOMANS: The Heathen Turks are uniquely uninterested in the religious struggle aspect of the game. Their goal is territory, power and loot. They are the only power that can engage in piracy in HIS. They are arguably the easiest side to play, so newcomers may want to play this side.<\/p> <p>HAPSBURGS: This power controls The Empire (it's not necessary to specify which one; there's only one) and are incredibly powerful at the start of the game, but surrounded by powers who are out to get them. The Hapsburgs are arguably the trickiest power to play (in terms of rules they have to concern themselves with), however their strength is such that they can screw a couple things up and still do well. To succeed as the Hapsburgs, you need to explore and colonize the New World, make some gains in Europe and help keep the Protestant reformation in check.<\/p> <p>FRANCE: The #2 power in Christendom, the French need to do a bit of everything to succeed. They're in a tough spot because their main rivals are the Hapsburgs who surround them on two sides, and they recently fought the Hundred Years' War with their neighbors to the North (England). So you might need to be a slick talker to avoid getting smooshed on all sides.<\/p> <p>ENGLAND: The good news is that you're on an island, and few people are going to have the means of invading you en masse. The bad news is that you're on an island, and it's going to be tough to pick up victory points by invading over land. More (potentially) bad news? Your king is Henry VIII, and he doesn't have a male heir. You're going to need to fix that, which means a risky roll on the Pregnancy Table. Did I mention this is the sort of game that has a Pregnancy Table? Yeah.<\/p> <p>PAPACY: As the Pope, you begin the game with a whole shed-load of victory points. The downside is that those points rapidly start to disappear as the Reformation sweeps Europe. And you have a pretty pathetic military, so you'll need to win the game through less bloody means. You can stanch the bleeding by burning books and winning theological debates -- but it's an uphill battle!<\/p> <p>PROTESTANTS: At the start of the game, Martin Luther's just a monk with a grudge. But things blow up pretty quickly. Early on, you'll be concentrating on the Power of Ideas to get you ahead of the game. Later on, a pivotal event called the Shmalkaldic League will happen, and your collection of dissident German city-states will form into an independent country with an army of its own, and all the opportunities that gives you and the problems that causes...<\/p> <p>If you're interested in signing up for the game, please leave a comment that states:<\/p> <p>1) Your experience level with the game (played many times, played a couple times, played once, never played but played similar games, TOTAL N00B)<br\/>2) Any powers you'd especially LIKE to play or any powers you'd especially NOT like to play. If you don't state the latter, I will assume you're OK with whatever.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/225349996\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"The Electric Reformation","id":"225349996","time":1442703600000,"updated":1442716888000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Mansfield","address_1":"263 N.

Originating from the Blue agave fields in Tequila, Jalisco in Mexico, the Tequila is an alcoholic drink produced with blue Weber agave. This agave plant is also known as weberi agave, weber agave, and agave tequilana (its scientific name).<\/p> <p>Agaves from the Highlands produce sweet and frutal tequilas, while agaves from the Lowlands are more herbaceous in nature. We will have the opportunity to taste the liquor's aroma and taste, along with some Mexican food items aimed at helping your mouth embrace the flavors of the various Tequilas. It has a denomination of origin which limits production to 5 Mexican states: Jalisco, Nayarit, Tamaulipas, Michoac\u00e1n and Guanajuato. The Consejo Regulador del Tequila (CRT for short) is the entity responsible for enforcing laws and regulating all tequila products.<\/p> <p>A similar Mexican drink, mezcal, also uses agave. Mezcal can be produced anywhere in Mexico and is subject to different regulations than tequila. An aficionado will also recognize that mezcal has a different, usually harsher flavor. In short, all tequila is mezcal, but not all mezcal is Tequila.<\/p> <p>The accompanying menu theme is Mexican so be prepared to try various food flavors. Some dish options contain nuts so PLEASE INDICATE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES.<\/p> <p>*<b>Tequilas will be provided, and there will be some Mezcal offerings as well.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>DISCLAIMER<\/b>: Please drink responsibly and make sure you either have a designated driver or a taxi pick you up.

With routes looping through Downtown, the Back Bay, Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, Hyde Park, Mattapan, Dorchester, and South Boston, it presents a truly unique way to see our great city.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be on the main courtyard up the stairs.

Like last year, we will continue to use meetup.com RSVPs to determine estimated attendance. This number will then dictate whether additional space is set aside for our group.

Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs, but try to bring soft snacks so that Clovis can have some too! If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!<\/p> <p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?<\/p> <p>Please let your organizer know!<\/p> <p>We are very fortunate to have Sharon host most of our fair weather meetups during the course of the year, with occasional help from myself, but we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup.\u00a0 We are looking for folks to host meetups on either Saturday or Sunday!<\/p> <p>We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in during the year. For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 20 to 40 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE MEETUPS<\/p> <p>We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!<\/p> <p>Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!<\/p> <p>Your organizers pay $89.94 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SouthofBostonPugs\/events\/224862449\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":7200000,"name":"The South of Boston September Pug Sunday Meetup","id":"224862449","time":1442772000000,"updated":1443620122000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1141585480000,"name":"The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group","group_lon":-71,"id":226623,"urlname":"SouthofBostonPugs","group_lat":42.0800018311,"who":"Pug People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":18.863576889,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441901827000,"fee":{"amount":65,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>LA Drummer Marla Leigh concert and workshops SEPT 19, 20<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Womyns-Drumming\/events\/224637294\/#\">Export<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Womyns-Drumming\/events\/224637294\/\">Tell a friend<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Womyns-Drumming\/events\/224637294\/\">Share<\/a><\/p> <p>Saturday, September 19, 2015<\/p> <p>7:30 PM<\/p> <p>Norwell, MA\"&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=179+Norwell+Ave%2C+Norwell%2C+MA+02061%2C+Norwell%2C+MA%2C+us\">lubdub Studio Norwell MA<\/a><\/p> <p>179 Norwell Ave, Norwell, MA 02061, Norwell, MA (<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=179+Norwell+Ave%2C+Norwell%2C+MA+02061%2C+Norwell%2C+MA%2C+us\">map<\/a>)<\/p> <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<\/p> <p>Drumming in the Feminine:\u00a0<br\/>Discover the ONLY Women's Ancient Drumming Tradition\" \u2661<\/p> <p>*Saturday, September 19<br\/>Concert with Marla Leigh with Slide Show presentation , 7:30pm<\/p> <p>*Sunday, September 20\u00a0<br\/>Frame Drum Workshop, 2-5pm<\/p> <p>~ * ~ * ~ *~ * ~ * ~ *~ * ~ * ~ *~ * ~ * ~ *<br\/>*********************************************<\/p> <p><i>Marla Leigh's East Coast Tour is starting here in\u00a0Massachusetts on September 19 and 20.

The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts Road. The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop. Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays (parking signs should say \"EX SUNDAY\" or similar).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/volleyball-122\/events\/225363239\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cambridge Advanced (Yankee C+) Indoor Volleyball","id":"225363239","time":1442772000000,"updated":1442781626000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1185306680000,"name":"Boston Volleyball Group","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":585043,"urlname":"volleyball-122","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Volleyball players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"659 Centre St, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130","name":"J.P.

Parents are also educated as part of this program. One of the parents of RKRF, trained by our organization, is launching\u00a0<i>Familia Saludable\u00a0<\/i>for Spanish-speaking parents.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

And that's whether it's at a school with kids, a university setting, or in life when you have to explain things to adults (e.g. pointy haired engineering managers) that don't understand them. And specifically, today's lesson is the teaching of math concepts. Everything from counting to algebra to calculus and beyond. What works and what doesn't? Is new math or new new math better or worse than the way Grandma did it? Should people memorize things like multiplication tables and trig identities, or should you teach the ideas and let the mental maps take care of themselves? How much abstraction can kids (or adults for that matter) handle? Is the academic world going to hell in a handbasket according to yet another middle aged generation?

It enables real-time voice, video and data sharing in a Web browser without the need for browser plugins or downloads. When WebRTC-enabled applications are coupled with contact centers, customer engagement can be transformed because customers and prospects can communicate with a contact center agent via voice or video from within the context of browsing a web page or from within a dedicated mobile app. This user context can accompany the call to the contact center agent, thus giving agents more information about a user intent, which allows the agent to satisfy the user\u2019s needs faster and better.<\/p> <p>Join business communication and technology expert analyst Brent Kelly of KelCor, Inc. and Plantronics Vice President of Innovation and New Ventures, Cary Bran as they discuss how organizations can rapidly develop and deploy WebRTC-enabled applications using WebRTC APIs.<\/p> <p>Brent Kelly<\/p> <p>Brent Kelly is Principal Analyst at KelCor, Inc. where he focuses on business communications processes and technologies.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Think about it. When a relationship doesn't work out, it's not always because people are plain and simply incompatible. A lot of times it's because people can't find a common ground to\u00a0relate to each other on.<\/p> <p>When they break up they've been focused on the other persons flaws, but very often they do not even notice their own. Placing blame on the the other partner shifts the burden of responsibility away from the only person you have power over to change;\u00a0Your self. In order for your next relationship to be better than your last, you need to make improvements to your self that will make that possible.<\/p> <p>What Would You Do If You Discovered Your Dating Strategy Was Flawed?<\/p> <p>The way our minds work is a complicated process that we are almost completely unaware of and our unconscious thoughts about dating are directly responsible for our results. This is especially tough when you consider that our unconscious mind holds 95% of our thinking. As a result, your unconscious thoughts are directly affecting your results with dating, so what you don't know that you're thinking is affecting you in real life.<\/p> <p>What's worse is that our thoughts create behaviors that contribute to our failures. Have you ever noticed a pattern in your own or even your friends dating habits or relationships? Chances are you have. Are your guy friends always dating women with attitude problems or using him for his money? Are your gal friends always dating the bad boys that break her heart when they leave?<\/p> <p>Whatever the case is, how you think about dating is so crucially important to your success. The first thing you must understand is that\u00a0your\u00a0perspective is limited. It's limited by what you don't see, by what you can't see yet, so what you\u00a0do\u00a0see is only a very small part of the truth. But it is your responsibility to stop being blind to the things that are holding you back.<\/p> <p>How Do Our Minds Really Work?<\/p> <p>I will expand more on this at the seminar, but here is a sample of what is in store for you...<\/p> <p>There are approximately 2 millions bits of information\u00a0coming at us at any given second, so much\u00a0that we can't possibly take it all in. In fact, we can only handle about 134 bits of information per second!

As a result, your unconscious thoughts are directly affecting your results with dating, so what you don't know that you're thinking is affecting you in real life.<\/p> <p>What's worse is that our thoughts create behaviors that contribute to our failures. Have you ever noticed a pattern in your own or even your friends dating habits or relationships? Chances are you have. Are your guy friends always dating women with attitude problems or using him for his money? Are your gal friends always dating the bad boys that break her heart when they leave?<\/p> <p>Whatever the case is, how you think about dating is so crucially important to your success. The first thing you must understand is that\u00a0your\u00a0perspective is limited.

Think about it. When a relationship doesn't work out, it's not always because people are plain and simply incompatible. A lot of times it's because people can't find a common ground to\u00a0relate to each other on.<\/p> <p>When they break up they've been focused on the other persons flaws, but very often they do not even notice their own. Placing blame on the the other partner shifts the burden of responsibility away from the only person you have power over to change;\u00a0Your self. In order for your next relationship to be better than your last, you need to make improvements to your self that will make that possible.<\/p> <p>What Would You Do If You Discovered Your Dating Strategy Was Flawed?<\/p> <p>The way our minds work is a complicated process that we are almost completely unaware of and our unconscious thoughts about dating are directly responsible for our results. This is especially tough when you consider that our unconscious mind holds 95% of our thinking. As a result, your unconscious thoughts are directly affecting your results with dating, so what you don't know that you're thinking is affecting you in real life.<\/p> <p>What's worse is that our thoughts create behaviors that contribute to our failures. Have you ever noticed a pattern in your own or even your friends dating habits or relationships? Chances are you have. Are your guy friends always dating women with attitude problems or using him for his money? Are your gal friends always dating the bad boys that break her heart when they leave?<\/p> <p>Whatever the case is, how you think about dating is so crucially important to your success. The first thing you must understand is that\u00a0your\u00a0perspective is limited. It's limited by what you don't see, by what you can't see yet, so what you\u00a0do\u00a0see is only a very small part of the truth. But it is your responsibility to stop being blind to the things that are holding you back.<\/p> <p>How Do Our Minds Really Work?<\/p> <p>I will expand more on this at the seminar, but here is a sample of what is in store for you...<\/p> <p>There are approximately 2 millions bits of information\u00a0coming at us at any given second, so much\u00a0that we can't possibly take it all in.

We are missing\u00a0so much!<\/p> <p>In order for us to be able to handle the information we receive, our nervous system deletes, distorts, generalizes, alters, and shapes our own internal perceptions of reality based on our our perceived limitations, our past personal experiences (both good and bad), our values, what we believe, the decisions we make, the language we use, our meta programs (mental processes which manage, guide and direct other mental processes), and our attitudes about things.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/6\/2\/highres_397554882.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>With all of this missing information, our mind then fills in the blanks on its own.

Think about it. When a relationship doesn't work out, it's not always because people are plain and simply incompatible. A lot of times it's because people can't find a common ground to\u00a0relate to each other on.<\/p> <p>When they break up they've been focused on the other persons flaws, but very often they do not even notice their own. Placing blame on the the other partner shifts the burden of responsibility away from the only person you have power over to change; <i>Your self<\/i>. In order for your next relationship to be better than your last, you need to make improvements to your self that will make that possible.<\/p> <p><b>What Would You Do If You Discovered Your Dating Strategy Was Flawed?<\/b><\/p> <p>The way our minds work is a complicated process that we are almost completely unaware of and our unconscious thoughts about dating are directly responsible for our results. This is especially tough when you consider that our unconscious mind holds 95% of our thinking. As a result, your unconscious thoughts are directly affecting your results with dating, so what you don't know that you're thinking is affecting you in real life.<\/p> <p>What's worse is that our thoughts create behaviors that contribute to our failures. Have you ever noticed a pattern in your own or even your friends dating habits or relationships? Chances are you have. Are your guy friends always dating women with attitude problems or using him for his money? Are your gal friends always dating the bad boys that break her heart when they leave?<\/p> <p>Whatever the case is, how you think about dating is so crucially important to your success. The first thing you must understand is that <i>your<\/i> <i>perspective is limited<\/i>. It's limited by what you don't see, by what you can't see yet, so what you <i>do<\/i> see is only a very small part of the truth. But it is your responsibility to stop being blind to the things that are holding you back.<\/p> <p><b>How Do Our Minds Really Work?<\/b><\/p> <p><i>I will expand more on this at the seminar, but here is a sample of what is in store for you...<\/i><\/p> <p>There are approximately 2 millions bits of information coming at us at any given second, so much that we can't possibly take it all in. In fact, we can only handle about 134 bits of information per second! We are missing <i>so much<\/i>!<\/p> <p>In order for us to be able to handle the information we receive, our nervous system deletes, distorts, generalizes, alters, and shapes our own internal perceptions of reality based on our our perceived limitations, our past personal experiences (both good and bad), our values, what we believe, the decisions we make, the language we use, our meta programs (mental processes which manage, guide and direct other mental processes), and our attitudes about things.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/6\/2\/highres_397554882.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>With all of this missing information, our mind then fills in the blanks on its own.

A lush, richly layered novel in which our world has been plunged into an age of unreason, Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights is a breathtaking achievement and an enduring testament to the power of storytelling.\u00a0In the near future, after a storm strikes New York City, the strangenesses begin. A down-to-earth gardener finds that his feet no longer touch the ground. A graphic novelist awakens in his bedroom to a mysterious entity that resembles his own sub\u2013Stan Lee creation. Abandoned at the mayor\u2019s office, a baby identifies corruption with her mere presence, marking the guilty with blemishes and boils. A seductive gold digger is soon tapped to combat forces beyond imagining.\u00a0Unbeknownst to them, they are all descended from the whimsical, capricious, wanton creatures known as the jinn, who live in a world separated from ours by a veil. Centuries ago, Dunia, a princess of the jinn, fell in love with a mortal man of reason. Together they produced an astonishing number of children, unaware of their fantastical powers, who spread across generations in the human world.\u00a0Once the line between worlds is breached on a grand scale, Dunia\u2019s children and others will play a role in an epic war between light and dark spanning a thousand and one nights\u2014or two years, eight months, and twenty-eight nights. It is a time of enormous upheaval, in which beliefs are challenged, words act like poison, silence is a disease, and a noise may contain a hidden curse.\u00a0Inspired by the traditional \u201cwonder tales\u201d of the East, Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel is a masterpiece about the age-old conflicts that remain in today\u2019s world. Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights is satirical and bawdy, full of cunning and folly, rivalries and betrayals, kismet and karma, rapture and redemption.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Event Co-Sponsor: Nieman Foundation for Journalism: <a href=\"http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nieman.harvard.edu\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

If you'd like to come, please RSVP...otherwise, we may do a neighborhood-exploration run starting from our house right when we're home from work instead.<\/p> <p><br\/>It's been...forever. Let's get together and try this whole running thing again now that it isn't 90 degrees out. I know there's interest in running courses other than the track, but for this first one it's best to stick with what's familiar. That way, we can all run at our own pace or do whatever workout we want to attempt without losing the group. And I haven't run for months, so I would prefer not to straggle behind...<\/p> <p>As far as location goes, I've discovered a new track on the Medford side of things. This could be nice because it's easy to park in Medford, plus it sounds like a lot of us live here now. I haven't checked it out in person yet, but will do so this weekend. If it doesn't look suitable, or if it's really impossible for most of the attendees to make it to Medford, we'll use the Tufts track again.<\/p> <p>So, to summarize, expect a free-for-all very low stakes run\/walk thing that might last about 30 minutes with some time set aside afterwards for catching up (or catching...ice cream? A beer? Bring your ideas), a lot of harassment from me to commit to doing (or volunteering for) the Oktoberfest 5K, and potential scouting of a new location. I'm going to post a run for Wednesday, too, with more of the same. I'm not sure my schedule will ever permit me to commit to a three times per week event again, but I am definitely planning on posting more regularly in the time leading up to the 5K and for as long as the weather holds afterwards.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic tables near bouldering area (the one furthest from cubbies if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/224810365\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"bsxnglytmbcc","time":1442876400000,"updated":1442950798000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Oxford St","name":"Harvard Science Center - Hall C","lon":-71.117943,"id":9371722,"state":"MA","lat":42.375309,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.67191410065,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441499132000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Science and Cooking returns! <\/b>- A semester-long public lecture series that pairs Harvard University professors with popular chefs and food experts to showcase the science behind different cooking techniques.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/225259054\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytmbcc","time":1442878200000,"updated":1442924334000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Online","address_1":"Internet","name":"Cyberworld","lon":0,"id":23828508,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442309812000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>There are unlimited possibilities in notes to make quick cash, monthly income, and build long term wealth.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our goal at NNG is to build a note community by teaching investors how to capitalize on the foreclosure crisis by buying mortgage notes for pennies on the dollar.

In addition, Deanna Coyle and Robert Vona, financial professionals at Centinel Financial Group, will present strategies for paying for college as well as applying for The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).<\/p> <p><i>There is no cost for attendance.

Ultimately the consensus seems to be that moving applications to the cloud is a good thing, the next question is \u201chow\u201d? One solution that has taken the world by storm is Docker. While initially Docker seems promising, development and operations teams are often left with the problem of coming up with some type of Docker orchestration and management solution for deploying their applications. In this session we will get our hands dirty.<\/p> <p><br\/>We are going to use IBM Bluemix to get your application to the cloud and leverage the power and portability of Docker containers. We\u2019ll talk about everything from build pipelines, to private registries, to container monitoring.

Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/225395271\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytmbdc","time":1442961000000,"updated":1442973144000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861012935638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440856071000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NAAAP Boston WIN and Harvard Pilgrim cordially invite you to an evening about mindfulness, meditation, acupuncture and massage therapy, and how to incorporate them into your everyday life, even at the office!<\/p> <p><br\/>The workshop will be interactive and practitioners will be doing demonstrations.

Across the city's archdiocese, trusted priests have been accused of the worst possible betrayal of the souls in their care. In\u00a0<i>Faith<\/i>, Jennifer Haigh explores the fallout for one devout family, the McGanns.<\/p> <p>Estranged for years from her difficult and demanding relatives, Sheila McGann has remained close to her older brother Art, the popular, dynamic pastor of a large suburban parish. When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.<\/p> <p>As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface,\u00a0<i>Faith<\/i>\u00a0explores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence\u2014and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs\u2014and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth,\u00a0<i>Faith<\/i>\u00a0is a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief.

All are welcome to attend an introductory meeting on Tuesday September 22 at 7pm, exact location to be announced, but it\u2019ll be in the Roslindale\/JP\/West Roxbury area. This introductory meeting is your opportunity to learn more about masterminds, and to have a hand in establishing the framework of the group.\u00a0There is cost to participate in the Mastermind group, beyond the possible expense of meeting space and the fees that Meetup charges.<\/p> <p><b>So, what is a mastermind group exactly?<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Mastermind groups offer a combination of fun, brainstorming, education, peer accountability and support in a group setting to sharpen your business and personal skills. A mastermind group helps you and your mastermind group members achieve success.<br\/>Participants challenge each other to set powerful goals, and more importantly, to accomplish them. The group requires commitment, confidentiality, willingness to both give and receive advice and ideas, and support each other with total honesty, respect and compassion. Mastermind group members act as catalysts for growth, devil\u2019s advocates and supportive colleagues. This is the essence and value of mastermind groups.<\/p> <p><b>What a Mastermind Group is NOT<\/b><\/p> <p>It's not a class. While your group can vote to bring in guest speakers and teachers occasionally, the main focus of a mastermind group is the brainstorming and accountability support among the group members. It's not group coaching. Mastermind groups are about the MEMBERS sharing with each other, not about the Facilitator coaching individuals in a group setting. You get everyone's feedback, advice and support. Yes, if the Facilitator is an expert on the topic, by all means chime in. But keep the conversation balanced between all members.<br\/>It's not a networking group. While you may share leads and resources with each other, it is not the main focus of the meetings. However, through your connections with other members, you will find plenty of joint venture opportunities, lead sharing, and professional networking.<\/p> <p><b>Napoleon Hill's Definition<\/b><\/p> <p>The concept of the \"mastermind alliance\" was formally introduced by Napoleon Hill in his timeless classic, \"Think And Grow Rich,\" though mastermind groups have been around since the beginning of time. Even Benjamin Franklin belonged to such a group, which he called a Junto.<br\/>Napoleon Hill wrote about the mastermind group principle as: \"The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.\"<\/p> <p>He continues\u2026<\/p> <p>\"No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind [the master mind].\"<\/p> <p><b>What You'll Get From Belonging to a Mastermind Group<\/b><\/p> <p>In a mastermind group, the agenda belongs to the group and each person's participation and commitment is key. Your mastermind partners give you feedback, help you brainstorm new possibilities, and set up accountability structures that keep you focused and on track. You create a community of supportive colleagues who brainstorm together to move the members to new heights.<br\/>You'll gain tremendous insights which improve your business and personal life. Your mastermind group is like having an objective board of directors, a success team, and a peer advisory group, all rolled into one.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working together toward mutual business success!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Roslindale-Small-Business-Owners-Meetup\/events\/225049887\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Look, it's a brand-new Mastermind Group, in Roslindale!","id":"225049887","time":1442962800000,"updated":1442974829000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1441143473000,"name":"Small Business Owners Mastermind Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":18890245,"urlname":"Roslindale-Small-Business-Owners-Meetup","group_lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Business Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01810","country":"us","city":"Andover","phone":"978-474-8010","address_1":"90 Main Street","name":"Circles of Wisdom","lon":-71.1386,"id":847127,"state":"MA","lat":42.6543,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.6742553711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441129962000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>September features special guest Steve Parsons from the UK. Our topic will be What is a ghost ~ That infernal question that all who are engaged in psychical research and specifically spontaneous cases of apparitions and hauntings have been striving to answer for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

Spiritualists inform us that they are the trapped souls of the deceased unable or unwilling to move on to the higher planes of existence. Parapsychologists offer the opinion that ghosts represent nothing more than hallucinations or some other unkind trick of the mind.<br\/>Together we will consider the question What is a Ghost?

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

As Jewish humanists, we recognize the value of putting aside time each year to engage in this process, but also demand that holiday rituals be updated to fit our nontheistic beliefs. With this year's services at the Hub, we are attempting to create a communal experience that reflects the importance of our Jewish cultural roots while also expressing our humanistic philosophy of life. We\u2019re also working to create a secular alternative to the traditional holiday liturgy that represents a beautiful work of art in its own right, and will highlight the holidays' traditional themes through poetry, debate, meditation, discussion, and song. We have deliberately included several Hebrew selections, given Hebrew\u2019s importance to the Jewish people and its role in the secular liturgy that is found in modern Israeli music and poetry. There's a little something for everyone, we hope. And at the end of the holidays, we'll seek your feedback about which rituals you liked (or didn't!) to incorporate into our plans for next year. We hope you'll join us for our celebration of the Jewish new year and the circle of life.<\/p> <p>TICKETS REQUIRED.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

But literary acclaim could not erase the young lawyer\u2019s memory of the brutal floggings he had witnessed aboard ship or undermine the vow he had made to combat injustice. In Slavish Shore, Jeffrey Amestoy tells the story of Dana\u2019s unflagging determination to keep that vow in the face of nineteenth-century America\u2019s most exclusive establishment: the Boston society in which he had been born and bred. Dana\u2019s extraordinary advocacy put him at the center of some of the most consequential cases in American history: defending fugitive slave Anthony Burns, justifying President Lincoln\u2019s war powers before the Supreme Court, and prosecuting Confederate president Jefferson Davis for treason. Yet Dana\u2019s own promising political career remained unfulfilled as he struggled to reconcile his rigorous conscience with his restless spirit in public controversy and private life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Jeffrey Amestoy was the 38th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Vermont. He was elected Attorney General of Vermont in 1984 and was re-elected six times. In five of those elections he was the nominee of the Republican and Democratic parties. In 1997 he was appointed to the Supreme Court by Governor Howard Dean. In 1999 Amestoy was author of the Vermont Supreme Court's opinion in Baker v. State which held that same-sex couples were constitutionally entitled to the rights and benefits of marriage.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast\/events\/225381918\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Richard Henry Dana","id":"225381918","time":1443043800000,"updated":1443056071000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164140077000,"name":"The Cambridge Moveable Feast","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":370532,"urlname":"Cambridge-Moveable-Feast","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Citizens of the World"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02127","country":"us","city":"South Boston","address_1":"1849 William J Day Blvd","name":"Castle Island","lon":-71.025325,"id":721878,"state":"MA","lat":42.332866,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":2.95862650871,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442094569000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I work just down the street from Castle Island, and enjoy taking an after-work walk around Castle Island and Pleasure Bay.

The leader (Bob Barnes) of the Wedeln Ski and Snowboard Race Team will hold dryland training every Wednesday night this Fall. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer. Bob's enthusiasm for skiing and training is contagious, he will get you working hard and getting results. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat. Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for the ski season.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/5\/600_10414789.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. Darlene Stokes and Tom Lane will also lead the group in additional exercises designed to increase flexibility and build a strong core. Last year we had many people from Meetup join us for these workouts. Some even became regular guests up at our ski house in NH. Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. The workouts last 1.5 hours and are always immediately followed by a few drinks and sometimes some food at a variety of Waltham Center Bars\/Restaurants.
