Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself. But what if that mirror has been neglected for hundreds of years? There are layers and layers of debris, dust, dirt and filth. And when you look into that mirror, all you see is the dust and the dirt that is accumulated, and all that you think is \u201cThis is me!\u201d But when you clean the mirror, little by little you start seeing the image of yourself. And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are. Meditation is for that purpose; prayers are for that purpose; spirituality is for that purpose: to cleanse our heart, to cleanse our life-style so that we can actually directly experience our own essence, which is eternal, full of knowledge and full of love<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/highres_438500682.jpeg","photo_id":438500682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/600_438500682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/thumb_438500682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":91531402,"name":"Dhyana"},"members":189,"name":"Meditation & Kirtan: For New and Experienced - LES\/E.Village","id":18662790,"state":"NY","urlname":"meditation-group-LES","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Meditaters, Yogis, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433942491000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"advertising","name":"Advertising","id":690},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"digital-media","name":"Digital Media","id":17188},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"social-media-for-business","name":"Social Media for Business","id":37708},{"urlkey":"learn-social-media-marketing","name":"Learn Social Media Marketing","id":80837},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-analytics","name":"Digital Marketing Analytics","id":785142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Snapchat-Marketing-in-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"A place to come together and talk about Snapchat\u2122 marketing.

Where there is deep grief, their was deep love. \n\n","lon":-74.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185724239,"name":"Soul Practice Yoga"},"members":30,"name":"Warrior Women - Grief Restorative Yoga in Bergen County","id":18664586,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Warrior-Women-Grief-Restorative-Yoga-in-Bergen-County","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.9300003052,"who":"Warrior Women-Grief Yoga"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433994556000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ai","name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":456},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"web-analytics","name":"Web Analytics","id":24439},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"emerging-technologies","name":"Emerging Technologies","id":69962},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Leading-Edge-Technologies-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Do you feel like the technology stack is changing faster than you can catch up?

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses. By being a member of the Network of Women in Business you will be able to increase your production and sales as a direct result of taking advantage of our training. You will be able to see a measurable difference in your bottom line.

A little about me: I've been studying combatives since the age of 13 (currently 43). I ve been a Fundamentals Level Coach with Blauer Tactical Systems (www.tonyblauer.com) since 2006. Over the course of my 30 year martial journey I've studied Boxing, Wing Chun, JKD, BJJ, Kali and Kinamotay. Additionally, I hold Personal Defense Readiness certifications in Weapons, and Ground Fighting. My approach to training is three dimensional with an emphasis on the micro-analysis of the emotional, psychological and physiological aspects of the ambush attack. When focusing on self preservation, it's imperative that one understands that weathering the components of a truly ballisic attack is beyond mastering any said technique or style of combat. Rather, it is a daily process of accepting and acclimating oneself to the asymmetrical, off -balance nature of the attack, embracing the chaos and then training to engage the necessary tools to neutralize the threat. What differentiates my training paradigm from others is that I don't promote teaching the body to conform to satisfy a martial art. Rather, I believe in using the body\u2019s natural and instinctive movement patterns to help protect oneself within the close quarter range. This includes: \u2022 Utilizing the hard-wired, DNA of our body\u2019s survival reflex to as the ignition switch to our movements \u2022 Non-gender, age, size, or occupation specific \u2022 All movements, are based on \u201cfunctional movement\u201d \u2022 All movements are elemental &amp; fundamental to survival so we are preparing for the 'unknown &amp; unknowable' This is a group for anyone interested&nbsp; in true self defense. Self protection includes awareness, fear management, verbal and physical skills. It can\/will include blunt weapons, fire arms, multiple attackers and confined spaces. I started this group in order to meet others that share the same passion. No prior training is required to join. If you have prior training, what you'll learn won't negate it. In fact, it will bridge the gap. <strong>DISCLAIMER: At the risk of sounding brash, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CASUAL INTEREST. I'm looking to meet with people that have a SERIOUS interest&nbsp; and&nbsp;who will commit to&nbsp;at least 2 hours&nbsp; a week.

Vinyasa means to flow and as we flow we focus on breath, proper alignment of the body (yes we do adjustments!), movement and the simple practice of unfettered yoga. Classes are taught by registered \/ certified teachers in our community studio located within the Trinity Presbyterian Church in Paramus, NJ.<\/p>\n<p>Just Breathe is not a religious program but does incorporate the importance of mindfulness, breath work and a positive outlook on life. People are our focus and today so many people are caretakers of aging or disable loved ones, working impossible hours and trying to meet the challenges of everyday life. It is easy to become \u201cunfit\u201d as we struggle to fit into a frantic world.

We, the organizers (Sharon and Louisa) are very passionate about Angelic Reiki and feel that Spirit is pushing us to spread the word, so that in a few years' time, Angelic Reiki will be well known to the metaphysical community. We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!!

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

It is very well known and recognized as a dynamic and effective meditation. It is being practiced throughout five continents and in over ninety countries. It brings you into balance by keeping you in the moment, in the present. In today's busy life, this meditation offers physiological, psychological, emotional, and spiritual benefits. This new method of individual transformation through awakening of inner energy, Sahaja Yoga Meditation could very well be the solution to resolve all the crises and serious problems our modern world is presently experiencing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sahaja meditation is &nbsp;a next step into human evolution. When we were evolved from Amoeba to humans, we were not aware of it. In order to evolve from human beings to pure joy and pure spirits, the all-pervading power wants us to realize the transformation. The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1. It is Free of Charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>2. It is simple and easy.<\/p>\n<p>Do not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3.

In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business. ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Networking requires commitment.

Well, if you are looking for a group that celebrates artists like these then look no further. From concerts by the original artists, to tribute\/cover bands, to happy hours, to other fun events, we have you covered! New York City has plenty of events centered around New Wave 80s (yes, and 90s too) music, and a lot of cool venues to experience this live music. So if you want to take advantage of all this, then come aboard the new Not-So-New Wave Rockers of NYC Meetup Group. Other social events will be had, as well as pre (and post) show happy hours to give members opportunities to hang out. The goal of this group is to create modest size, close-knit, meetups instead of the large groups where people can feel lost in the crowd. Finally, I am seeking a few co-organizers - so if you are interested, please let me know. Don't worry, I will not ask much of you!

If you have the same problem, let's meet up and swap food! We will meet bi-weekly and each member who RSVP's will make a dish that is equivalent to 5 cups of baby food (40 oz), package it in 10 small baggies, and swap with other members. Moms will be assigned a category for their dish before each meet-up: vegetable, carb, or protein. All food must be prepared using organic ingredients. Meet-ups will be at various times and can include bringing along the babies--weekday afternoons, morning coffee, weekend brunch, happy hour. All meet-ups will be in the BoCoCa area. There must be at least 5 RSVP'd moms for the meet-up to happen.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events.

To fulfill this aim we have created a peaceful city sanctuary located in the heart of Chelsea. Based on the books of the modern day Buddhist teacher, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, we present Buddha\u2019s teachings in an accessible manner that can easily be integrated into our modern lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Established over twenty years ago, hundreds of New Yorkers currently participate in our programs at the main center and throughout the city. The Center is run by volunteers who themselves are dedicated practitioners, and we have a warm and welcoming community. Please feel free to drop in for a visit. During opening hours there is always someone at hand who can answer your questions. In addition to the beautiful meditation room, you can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/bookstore-giftshop\/\">bookstore and gift shop<\/a>, or just spend time in our comfortable sitting and reading area. (Reference materials are available.)<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to participate in the activities at the center, we recommend that you begin with one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/study-programs\/general-program-classes\/\">General Program classes<\/a>. The evening classes on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mondays-intro-class\/\">Mondays<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/thursday-meditation-class-2\/\">Thursdays<\/a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/sunday-morning-meditation-class\/\">Sunday morning<\/a>&nbsp;classes are suitable for newcomers.

Taught by qualified Western teachers, the meditation classes and Buddhist philosophy are very easy to understand and apply to our daily lives. The classes are suitable for both beginners and more advanced practitioners, and emphasize how to meditate and practice in our NY urban environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>More information can be found on our website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/d\/4\/600_439887092.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/highres_439837262.jpeg","photo_id":439837262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/600_439837262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/thumb_439837262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189398249,"name":"Diane Hill"},"members":56,"name":"Kadampa Meditation Center NYC Meetup","id":18715176,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kadampa-Meditation-Center-NYC-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Students"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435875676000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaycouples","name":"Gay Couples","id":4605},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"friends-supporters-of-lgbt-glbt","name":"Friends & Supporters of LGBT\/GLBT","id":27521},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804},{"urlkey":"lgbt-singles","name":"lgbt singles","id":66447}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Staten-Island-LGBTQ-Pride-Bowling-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In partnership with the Pride Center of Staten Island, join your community for an of bowling and learn more about the Pride Center of Staten Island Fall Bowling League!

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

Mental well-being is the core building block of everything we do in life, whether we want to perform or not.

If there an area of your life that you feel stuck in\u2026some area that feels stressful or even hopeless? Some situation from your past or even a present circumstance holding you back? This is also perfect for you. Most people do not realize that their lives can be significantly happier than they currently are. They think that life is hard and that struggling is normal. With a simple shift in understanding, your life will be better; it can be much better. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Note: My intention is to create a safe, non-judgmental space.

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

JOIN US. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>Life is tough.&nbsp; It's even harder when you're trying to accomplish big goals.&nbsp; And well, it's nearly impossible to accomplish those big goals entirely by yourself.&nbsp; So... why not share your goals and dreams with other winners and get their feedback?&nbsp; Why not encourage others with your unique perspective on their situations?&nbsp; EVERYONE needs encouragement and 'outside the box' thinking.&nbsp; This group can provide that encouragement and outside-the-box thinking.&nbsp; More importantly, you can provide that same fresh positive outlook to other group members.&nbsp; A rising tide raises all ships.&nbsp; So come join this rising tide of awesome people doing awesome things!&nbsp; Monroe Mann (Bio below, or Google him) and his fellow Break Divers will inspire you, encourage you, and force you to think in ways you never could have on your own.&nbsp; The result: your life is going to get a whole lot better. <br> <br><b>WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT AS A BREAK DIVING MEMBER:<\/b>&nbsp; <br>The basic framework of the group is meetings and get-togethers--inspirationally focused and moderated by motivational dynamo Monroe Mann, who many have called The Tony Robbins of the Entertainment World.&nbsp; Our meetings are ALWAYS inspiring; always hands-on and practical; always future focused (i.e. YOUR future); and often have an adventure portion to them, i.e. a Citibike adventure in NYC that starts with a motivational pow-wow and finishes with an invigorating kick in the pants.&nbsp; <br> <br>More specifically, each meeting has a three-part focus: <br><i> <br>FIRST:<\/i> we start off with a motivational topic introduced by the moderator, i.e. your goals over the next month or year; or thinking about your life's biggest problem and how to solve it; etc.&nbsp;<i> <br> <br>SECOND:<\/i> we have a workshop portion during which you can talk and interact with fellow members, discussing the particular topic introduced earlier.&nbsp; Sometimes the workshop may simply be sipping coffee and chatting, and at other times, it may be an outdoor activity like riding Citibikes or hiking, or doing some other fun activity like going to see a movie, or browsing the stacks at a bookstore. <br><i> <br>FINALLY:<\/i>&nbsp; each Meetup concludes with a final motivational pow-wow to go over solutions to whatever problems were introduced during the beginning of the meetup.&nbsp; During this time, everyone gets together and shares what they learned, and verbally and in writing, outlines their plans and to-do lists for the next few weeks or months. <br> <br>The idea is that each Meetup will leave you encouraged and motivated, armed with solutions to whatever issues you are facing, and a battle plan for the next few weeks to tackle your goals and dreams.&nbsp; More often than not, you'll also make new friendships and reinforce old ones. &nbsp; <br> <br>Regarding the activities: we might have writing workshops; we might meet at Broadway Dance Center; we might go for a walk in the park; we might go to Playland; we might simply meet for a chat to go over our one, three, and five year goals.&nbsp; THE ACTIVITIES ARE MERELY A MEANS TO AN END: the activity becomes a casual and fun way to allow the wisdom and inspiration of the pre\/post event pow-wows to percolate in your mind.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: the focus of Break Diving is simple--to guide one another to become our best by inspiring one another to overcome difficult challenges on the road to reaching our dreams.&nbsp; In other words, this Meetup group's purpose is to help inspire you to DIVE into this crazy world and FIND YOUR BREAKS AND OPPORTUNITIES.&nbsp; We want you to become... a Break Diver! <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Sound good?<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>If so, come join our collective of winners!&nbsp; If you are ready to grab life by the horns and finally do what you know you were meant to do, welcome to your new home, and welcome... to the first day of the rest of your life.&nbsp; Note: Membership requires application and approval.&nbsp; If you already know two members, your application will be processed more easily. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>MODERATED BY:<\/b><\/p>\n<p> Monroe Mann, the founder of Break Diving, and a dude who epitomizes the philosophy of No Rules, No Excuses, No Regrets that he espouses. In his short life to date he has: <\/p>\n<p>* written and published 8 self-help and business books, one of which is a Barnes &amp; Noble # 1 bestseller <br>* served his country as an intelligence office in Iraq and was nominated for a bronze star <br>* produced and directed the now successful comedy horror film \"You Can't Kill Stephen King\" (available at Best Buy and Amazon Instant Video) and is listed on IMDb as an actor, writer, producer, director <br>* Lived in Europe for two years, China for one, and Iraq for one, and now speaks French, Italian, and Chinese--all at above conversational levels, and knows basic Arabic. <br>* Earned five advanced degrees: Juris Doctor, MBA, Masters in Entrepreneurship, Masters of Law in Commercial Real Estate, and is now completing his PhD dissertation in Psychology <br>* Earned his EMT, Lifeguard, and Wilderness EMT certifications and volunteered as such in Haiti after the earthquake <br>* Gone on a one-week dogsledding adventure, driven cross country from NYC to San Diego, traveled cross-country by Amtrak from Seattle to New York City, been to over 30 countries, won an ostrich riding competition in South Africa, dove with sharks in the Bahamas, played with falcons in Mongolia, performed on stage with New York City Opera, and the list goes on and on and on! <br>* Bottom line: he has given hundreds of motivational speeches to people and organizations around the world and helped change the lives of thousands, and he wants to help change yours for the better too! <\/p>\n<p><b>Why does he want to run this meetup group?<\/b>&nbsp; Because his greatest joy in life is helping others to realize that \"impossible\" is just an excuse.&nbsp; And when you get inspired, you will in turn be helping to inspire him.&nbsp; Maybe most importantly, he likes making new friends with those who are also doing or trying to do great things with their lives.&nbsp; It's a win, win, win!&nbsp; So join, join, join! <\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/a\/4\/highres_440740356.jpeg","photo_id":440740356,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/a\/4\/600_440740356.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/a\/4\/thumb_440740356.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":69331402,"name":"Monroe Mann"},"members":33,"name":"Break Diving NYC - No Rules, No Excuses, No Regrets.

Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.

Just like driving a car it becomes second nature over time, but you must practice, practice, practice! <br><\/p>\n<p>What I learn I like to share with others, because it helps me become a better photographer. We can all learn from each other, share tips, and support each other in our efforts to become better photographers. If you don't try, you can't fail, and if you don't fail, you can't learn. Let's get together and make it happen! Join us for events, and 1 on 1 sessions; we will be visiting various locations in NYC, as well as participate in seminars, and exhibitions.<\/p>\n<p>This group requires membership dues, and is fee-based, because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service.

We'll cover a wide range of topics such as where to start with no experience, hunting regulations, firearm laws, practice, hunting tactics, finding land, etc. As well as create a place where people can meet others, pool resources, and share experiences and encouragement.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/0\/5\/highres_440084037.jpeg","photo_id":440084037,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/0\/5\/600_440084037.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/c\/0\/5\/thumb_440084037.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176741352,"name":"Eric Ruggiero"},"members":38,"name":"NYC Outdoorsmen & Women","id":18762919,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Outdoorsmen-women","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Newark","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437657113000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"wrestling","name":"Wrestling","id":2161},{"urlkey":"mixed-martial-arts","name":"Mixed Martial Arts","id":15514},{"urlkey":"muay-thai","name":"MUAY THAI","id":15879},{"urlkey":"jewish","name":"Jewish","id":16684},{"urlkey":"kickboxing","name":"Kickboxing","id":18225},{"urlkey":"grappling","name":"Grappling","id":21218},{"urlkey":"brazilian-jiujitsu","name":"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu","id":22237},{"urlkey":"mma-mixed-martial-arts","name":"MMA Mixed Martial Arts","id":35023},{"urlkey":"brazilian-jiu-jitsu","name":"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu","id":46818},{"urlkey":"bjj","name":"BJJ","id":47359},{"urlkey":"wrestling-grappling","name":"Wrestling & Grappling","id":78827}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MMA-Beginner-to-Expert\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Anyone who wants to learn real fighting techniques from excellent teachers in a safe environment.<\/p>","lon":-74.1399993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":178595482,"name":"Andrew"},"members":50,"name":"MMA Beginner to Expert","id":18762925,"state":"NJ","urlname":"MMA-Beginner-to-Expert","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437660648000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sportsfans","name":"Sports Fan","id":83},{"urlkey":"collegefootball","name":"College Football","id":2600},{"urlkey":"football","name":"American Football","id":11660},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"florida-state-football","name":"Florida State football","id":25780},{"urlkey":"auburn-tigers","name":"Auburn Tigers","id":39693},{"urlkey":"sec-football","name":"SEC Football","id":45906},{"urlkey":"ncaa-football","name":"NCAA FOOTBALL","id":67540},{"urlkey":"seminoles","name":"Seminoles","id":80213},{"urlkey":"auburn","name":"Auburn","id":113716},{"urlkey":"fsu","name":"FSU","id":125967},{"urlkey":"watching-college-football-games","name":"Watching college football games","id":153765},{"urlkey":"sec-college-football","name":"SEC College Football","id":231501},{"urlkey":"auburn-football","name":"Auburn Football","id":476062}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SEC-Football-Families-in-Brooklyn\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>As a father of two young children living far away from even the expanded SEC vicinity, I have a hard time finding like-minded individuals with whom to watch football as it was meant to be played.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through the New Age Movement. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit.

Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.
