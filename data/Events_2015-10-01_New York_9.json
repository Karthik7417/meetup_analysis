You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

Most of her clients are foreign tech entrepreneurs seeking to enter the U.S. market and tech startups hiring foreign specialists. Entrepreneurs often have a difficult time getting a work visa in the U.S. because our country does not offer a \u201cstartup visa\u201d or any other option well-suited for startup founders.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena.

We're fortunate to have Derek join us as he'll discuss details of the paper and a Q\/A session. You can checkout Derek's paper <a href=\"http:\/\/lincolnlabs.com\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFurther Description<\/p> <p>The United States economy is barely growing. The engine of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and new firm creation, has been declining for the past three decades. Today, we are the lobbyists for the future, advocating on behalf of start-ups that don't exist yet. We can grow the economy through unleashing the full forces of innovation across the economy. Here's how to foster permissionless innovation.<\/p> <p>For as long as we can remember, technologists have thrown a Heisman (or perhaps another one-finger hand gesture) to the government. We get it. Government is clunky and slow and boring. It\u2019s where good ideas go to die. But here\u2019s the thing: government isn\u2019t going away. Public policy matters, and it matters a hell of a lot to innovators and entrepreneurs whose ideas are changing the world.<\/p> <p>Lincoln Labs is the connecting hub for these two worlds. We think better communication will lead to more liberty-minded laws and regulations, a more efficient government and a freer society, which in turn makes it easier for innovators to innovate. So what exactly do we mean by liberty? Liberty means freedom, individuality, self-sufficiency. It means creativity, free will and latitude. Translation: it means government being less of a roadblock.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/lincoln-labs\/events\/225385245\/","yes_rsvp_count":33,"name":"Pushing for economic growth in the future","id":"225385245","time":1443135600000,"updated":1443147809000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440866316000,"name":"Lincoln Labs NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18879750,"urlname":"lincoln-labs","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07424","country":"us","city":"Little Falls","phone":"973-837-0199","address_1":"101 Newark-Pompton Turnpike","name":"The Fine Grind","lon":-74.244862,"id":888105,"state":"NJ","lat":40.88423,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.2692070007,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440726866000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be reading The Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown in September.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change <\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a><br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains\/events\/224700013\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Happiness and \"The Secret\"  7-9pm at Barnes & Noble in White Plains","id":"mhqchlytmbgc","time":1443135600000,"updated":1443193890000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398801633000,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","group_lon":-73.75,"id":14180342,"urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"25 1st Avenue","name":"The Bhakti Center","lon":-73.988495,"id":23900738,"state":"NY","lat":40.723782,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.81711006165,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434304279000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Kirtan is a form of devotional chanting whose roots go back over 500 years to India.

It's a casual atmosphere that might include some connection games. It's a great way to introduce friends to the concept of OM and the community itself since there will be lots of people there with years of experience in the practice. OMing will not take place AT the event but for those trained in the art there will be a circle beforehand at the usual time. The event is free! The door will open at 7:30 sharp and we will go until about 9:30. You're welcome to come anytime in between, unlike our other events which have tighter time tables. BUT we can't guarantee there will be any food left and you might miss some fun so try to come on time!

He is the CEO of a startup Internet of Things company and former founder and CEO of a few successful technology companies. His professional focus throughout most of his career has been on commercialization of new technology and particularly in managing disruptive IT innovations. Jim spends most of the year in Washington, DC though he finds his way to Charleston, SC, Europe and on various adventures as often as possible.<\/p> <p><br\/>On the strictly professional side, he began his career in the US Foreign Service where he served as a commercial attach\u00e9 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Later he worked as a consultant for William Kent International focusing on commercialization of new technologies for a variety of Fortune 500 companies.<\/p> <p><br\/>For a number of years, Jim has lived in the Washington, DC area and focused on the start-up and development of technology based IT and healthcare businesses. Some of his ventures include development of patented devices to reduce repetitive stress injuries, applications of touchscreen technology to improve data capture in electronic medical records and creation of a web portal to facilitate the management of clinical research data. Most recently he served as CEO of a company providing connectivity and mobility solutions to a Fortune 500 client base.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll get a chance to hear about his experience in the Foreign Services and his\u00a0 journey in tech, with Q&amp;A and community shout outs afterwards! Also join us for good coffee, good bagels, and excellent conversation.<\/p> <p>Until then, stay cool and classy...

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p><b>How long will the meetup be? <\/b><br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend.

Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p><b>Do members need to bring anything? <\/b><br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome? <\/b><br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level.

This will be my 6th trip to run a Community Arts and Yoga Program at Hopital Adventiste d'Haiti. I first went down to Haiti after the earthquake in July 2010, and I have returned every year\u00a0since to work with hospital patients and young people in the surrounding neighborhood. The pictures below are from my trip. \u00a0We were having a lot of fun with this group tree pose!<\/p> <p><b>What you can give:<\/b><br\/>A financial contribution is the best way to give. The money goes directly to pay for the young people in my programs to go to school. School in Haiti is 80% fee-based, and can range from US$100-$400 a year (costs of school fees plus uniforms, books, exam fees, etc). I go with each student and their guardian and pay at the school directly, after making sure their grades merit the support. Last year, we were able to raise enough money to send 12 children and teens to school.<br\/>Backpacks, school supplies(notebooks, pens, pencils, etc), sneakers (especially men's size 10 and above) and sandals. I also need one large suitcase and one carry-on luggage to carry these supplies.<br\/>The young people also ask me for electronics - if you have a laptop, cell phone, or iPod you have to give, you will make someone extremely happy.<\/p> <p><b>How you can give:<\/b> Supplies: You can bring supplies to the Rubin or coordinate with me for other options.<br\/>Financial contributions: Cash or checks will be collected at the Rubin or online through Paypal or Chase QuickPay(use [masked] as my email address).

School in Haiti is 80% fee-based, and can range from US$100-$400 a year (costs of school fees plus uniforms, books, exam fees, etc). I go with each student and their guardian and pay at the school directly, after making sure their grades merit the support.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 8 and 15 mini dates each lasting between 3 and 6 minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>FAQ:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE?<\/b><br\/>Please no sneakers, t-shirts or gym attire.<br\/><b><br\/>CAN I PAY AT THE EVENT DOOR?<\/b><br\/>We do no accept payment at the event door.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again. We may be biased but we definitely think this is a much better way to meet people than online dating or at a random bar.<\/p> <p>You will go on between 8 and 15 mini dates each lasting between 3 and 6 minutes each (we lengthen or shorten the date time according to how many people attend). Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date!<\/p> <p><b>FAQ:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE?<\/b><br\/>Please no sneakers, t-shirts or gym attire.<br\/><b><br\/>CAN I PAY AT THE EVENT DOOR?<\/b><br\/>We do no accept payment at the event door.

Egypt is also the land of secrets. Another history, a secret history, tells of Egypt as the inheritor of deep wisdom and magical ability from an even earlier culture. It is the account of the Egyptians themselves. This alternate history is echoed by parallel accounts from the myth and history of other ancient cultures, as well as myriad secret societies and occult sources. The remarkable number of parallels in these stories provides a unique window into this other Egypt.<\/p> <p>A new kind of counterculture is emerging around the unexpected discoveries of a small but growing circle of scientists, authors and researchers. The focal point of this counterculture centers on an alternative interpretation of ancient Egypt - not as mankind's earliest attempts at primitive civilization, but as a fully developed, and inexplicably advanced culture, who's scientific and metaphysical achievements we are only beginning to fully appreciate.<\/p> <p><b>All Are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224408599\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Magical Egypt: Navigating the Afterlife","id":"fpbtflytmbhc","time":1443220200000,"updated":1443233117000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":21,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1412231663000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Space Rental Fee","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Friday Japanese\/English Language Exchange<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\nJoin us for 2 hours every \u201cFriday Japanese \/ English Language Exchange!\" In this event, you will get to learn about English and Japanese as well as socialize with other members!

In particular, because Je Tsongkhapa is an emanation of the Wisdom Buddha Manjushri, his faithful followers never experience difficulty in increasing their wisdom. There are many other benefits from practicing Offering to the Spiritual Guide.

We also accumulate a great deal of merit \u2013 positive mental energy \u2013 the cause of good fortune.<br\/>During a Tsog puja we arrange a table of food and drinks \u2013 making it look as beautiful as we can. We imagine that we are preparing a banquet of delight for the holy beings to enjoy. We then invite the holy beings to the place of offerings and imagine they enjoy this blissful banquet.<br\/>Afterwards, we enjoy the Tsog offerings with our Spiritual friends.

We will be staying at the Heart Lake wilderness campground at the Adirondacks Loj. This campground is conveniently located at one of the three main trailheads that provide access to many of 46 High Peaks. We will have to coordinate car\/tent shares ahead of time, and solo tents most likely won't be permitted (unless it happens that we have a big 4-5 person tent on one site). The campsite is semi-developed, so we will have access to drinking water, and a restroom with running water and showers.<\/p> <p>It takes about 5 hours of driving to reach ADK Loj from New York City. Plan on leaving the city in the early afternoon on Friday, and arriving at the campground by 10 PM (you can check in at the campground as early as 2 PM). Arriving at the campsite on Friday means we can get up and start our hikes early on Saturday. Depending on the hikes you choose to do, you may need every bit of the daylight you can get.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll have to vacate our camp sites by 11 AM on Sunday, so before we go hiking on Sunday, we'll have to pack up all of our gear into cars, and move cars to the hiking parking lot.I suggest doing a shorter, a half day hike on Sunday and leaving the ADK by 4-5 PM - this will allow you to get back to the city at a decent time.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/7\/c\/600_394913372.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Cost, RSVP and\u00a0Cancellation\u00a0Policies:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The price for this trip is $28 per person and includes the cost of the campground, and the basic campground supplies only (firewood, cooking gas...).<\/p> <p>Food is not included in the price - you are responsible for bringing your own meals for the weekend!<\/p> <p>Please send your payment via paypal to:<\/p> <p><b>[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>Very Important:<\/b>\u00a0<\/i>You must select\u00a0\"sending money to family or friends\"\u00a0option.<\/p> <p>This will ensure that we receive the full\u00a0amount\u00a0you send us; otherwise a fee will be taken out of the\u00a0amount\u00a0you send, and you'll have to send another payment to cover the difference.<\/p> <p>If you do not have a paypal account and really don't want to open it, please email me for additional payment options.<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>There is a limited number of spots available for this trip.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please RSVP yes only if you are certain about going and ready to submit your payment. If the interest for the trip surpasses the capacity, members that RSVPed \"YES\" but failed to submit their payment will be replaced with members from the waiting list that are ready to commit.<\/p> <p>Cancellations made 14 days or more before the start date of the event will receive a full refund; for cancellations made within 14 days there will be no refunds.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please answer all RSVP questions. These questions are\u00a0necessary\u00a0for the campsite reservations, and will also help us plan and organize room and tent shares.<\/p> <p>If you do not make any arrangements on your own, you can either look for drivers\/passengers\/tent roommate using the message board, or we will suggest roommate\/driver\/passengers\u00a0based on the preferences\u00a0and departing location indicated in your RSVP answers.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/2\/8\/600_415846632.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Gear:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>This is a car camping trip. You'll need to either bring a tent, or to secure a space in someone else's tent - as the number of tents per campsite is limited we'll have to coordinate tent shares. You'll need a sleeping bag and a sleeping mat. Please keep in mind your sleeping bag temperature rating - in the late September, the temperature can easily drop to 40 during the night.<\/p> <p>Proper\u00a0footwear\u00a0is essential for all hikes in this region - a pair of\u00a0comfortable, broken-in shoes, with good\u00a0traction. Please no flip-flops, clogs, skate shoes and similar\u00a0footwear.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bring enough water containers to carry enough water for the entire day. There is a drinking water source at our campsite, but don't forget to bring your hydration packs, bottles. There are a few brooks\/creeks flowing through the region so depending on what hike you decide to go on, you may be able to filter the water on the trail.<\/p> <p>You are responsible for bringing your own food for this weekend. Along with the food, bring any spices, dishes, utensils, and such necessary for preparation of those meals. We will have a communal stove you can use to boil water\/heat up food, and a fire ring with camp fire later in the evening.<\/p> <p>You will need a small backpack to carry your food, water, and extra clothing during the hikes. Some of the ADK hikes are very steep and challenging, so you will need to use your hands to climb up\/down rocks and boulders, hold on to the roots and branches, so you need your hands to be free.<\/p> <p>The weather in the ADK can be\u00a0unpredictable, and can change in the matter of minutes. Although they're barely above 4000 feet, most of the peaks are bare and exposed so with a bit of a wind chill at the top, a sunny day can turn into a cold one - so be ready and dress in layers. Bring an extra layer, a hat, \u00a0and rain\/wind jacket that can fit into your backpack.\u00a0A pair of gloves can be helpful on a cold, windy day.<\/p> <p>As on any given hike - it is always a good idea to have your own map of the area you are hiking. You can purchase any ADK High Peaks trail map you find; I find none of them to be great - but National Geographic map #742 may be a bit better than others. Along with the map, on a terrain like this you should have your own compass as well, and know how to use it. If you have a hiking GPS, let me know and I can forward you links to Garmin compatible GPS trail maps.<\/p> <p>Headlamp\/flashlight is a must on this trip. Campground is fairly dark and you'll need your headlamp right upon your arrival, in order to setup your tent. Some of the hikes are long and it's not uncommon for people to finish those hikes well past dusk.<\/p> <p>Insect replant spray is always good to have handy when in the wilderness.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will have an access to a bathroom with running water and showers - but don't forget to bring your towel,soap,shampoo, slippers, and other toiletries.<\/p> <p>Cell phone signal is intermittent and can't be relied on in this region...but if you have the phone on you - in case of back country emergencies, such as lost or injured hikers, and wildland fires, please notify the DEC Forest Rangers at[masked]-0235.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/0\/4\/4\/600_394917412.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Hikes:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>There is a huge variety of hiking trails available in the vicinity of the campground, ranging from easy walks to the most difficult in the country top list hikes.

As you can see, the number of spots is very limited, so first come first serve. The details about pick up and drop off are below. To reserve a spot just RSVP to this meetup.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/c\/d\/600_440793485.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our recent day trips to the Catskills were awesome, so we're doing it again. Some folks were running, some were hiking, but all had fun and made new friends. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RAWTRAIL\/events\/past\/?scroll=true\">our photos and comments from the past trips.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>There are lots of ways to enjoy a day at North-South Lake Campground, but the main point of interest to us is probably the <b>famous Escarpment Trail<\/b>. If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not traversing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/b\/8\/600_442244984.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/7\/4\/600_441415156.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

In turn, diseases related to poor nutrition \u2013 including diabetes and heart disease \u2013 tend to be concentrated where demand for emergency food is greatest.<\/p> <p>As a natural extension of the anti-hunger work we began more than 30 years ago, City Harvest developed\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs to respond to the need for emergency food, improve access to fruits and vegetables for residents in low-income communities and provide nutrition education that will inspire affordable, healthy meal choices. Through our\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoods\u00a0programs, City Harvest partners with residents, community organizations, afterschool programs, and local businesses. Together we work to achieve a long-term impact in the fight against hunger by engaging residents in healthy choices and enhancing the local food landscape. Building off our nutrition education classes which began in 2000, and our Mobile Markets which began in 2004, City Harvest has since expanded\u00a0Healthy Neighborhoodsprograms to high-need communities across the five boroughs.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the location given","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HarlemGo\/events\/225533805\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":12600000,"name":"Volunteer Opportunity: City Harvest Mobile Market - Hamilton Heights","id":"225533805","time":1443271500000,"updated":1443391172000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344731038000,"name":"HarlemGo Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":4524292,"urlname":"HarlemGo","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Goers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Staten Island","address_1":"Tennyson Drive  (Armstrong Ave & Robinson Ave))","name":"Crescent Beach Park","lon":-74.154121,"id":24084013,"state":"NY","lat":40.540062,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.8997192383,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441970990000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us to volunteer your time to help clean up Crescent Beach.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Gloves and Trash Bags provided.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Meet like minded people. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Donuts &amp; Coffee will be offered. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Contact the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Events-NYC\/members\/184985147\/\">Laura<\/a> with any questions.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/b\/b\/600_441848123.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Fun-NYC\/events\/225280411\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Crescent Beach Cleanup!","id":"225280411","time":1443272400000,"updated":1443367681000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430853477000,"name":"!

A husband and wife balancing work and responsibilities all while raising their three sons. Over a 4-year period we soon realize the middle son is struggling in ways that do not seem common or typical. Is it a phase? Growing pains? The Mom, in particular, is faced with the daunting challenge of finding answers and help for her child. In a time where the impact of mental health challenges for families, parents, siblings and the community are just being realized -- this poignant story touches on a parents worst nightmare: What if you lost your child to a mental disorder?\u00a0 \u201cNo Letting Go\u201d is a powerful, heartfelt and poignant story of the strength of family and the bonds that connect us.\u00a0 As a society, we can no longer afford to stay silent. \u00a0<br\/>This film is adapted from the award-winning short film \u201cIllness.\u201d\u00a0 In 2013 and 2014, \u201cIllness\u201d won 7 awards, received over 20 nominations worldwide and was under consideration for the 2014 Academy Awards.<\/p> <p>\u00a0THE BLIND STIGMA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mentalhealthfilmfest.nyc\/upcomingfilms\/2015-films#\">&lt;\/a&gt;This thought-provoking short documentary discusses mental health within the black community.\u00a0 It chronicles and testifies the stories of five individuals on their trials and triumphs with mental health. Each story is told bravely and effectively with additional context provided by mental health professionals, religious leaders, caregivers, and your everyday citizen. Within the black community, mental health is deemed as a 'swept under the rug' stigma that has been creating false illusions and assumptions for a long time. That stigma is the core component of the African Canadian response to mental illness, and therefore African Canadians who suffer from mental illness are less likely to seek treatment. As a result, very few studies have been done on the impact of mental illness in the black community.\u00a0 \u201cThe Blind Stigma\u201d powerfully removes the veil of shame that clouds the topic of mental illness in the black community, challenge that misconception, gives a voice to black Canadians living with mental illness and leaves the audience more informed and empowered. #ChangeTheStigma<\/p> <p>\u00a0PATIENT\u2019S RITES: A MUSICAL DOCUMENTARY Using the institution of popular song married to the music video idiom, I have created a long-form, 48-minute musical documentary titled \u201cPatient\u2019s Rites\u201d. It exposes the familiar tropes and stereotypes associated with the mental health community while opening a dialogue about preconceived and prejudicial ideas, stigma, the realities of the mental health system and how openness can aid in respecting psychiatric survivors who are our fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, friends and neighbors. Think of it as a therapy session set to music.<\/p> <p>\u00a0CRACKING UP In \u201cCracking Up\u201d, you\u2019ll see a group of people who suffer the stigma of mental illness on a daily basis; strangers fear them, staring and whispering behind their backs. Many of them have survived suicide attempts, psychotic breaks and have been in and out of institutions for years. But ultimately, they are the underdogs who set out to achieve something that even they don\u2019t believe they will be able to do\u2026<br\/>Cracking Up features naturally gifted people from all walks of life who happen to be afflicted with mental illnesses. Through the art of stand-up comedy, they learn to confront their demons and set out on a journey of hope and possibility.<\/p> <p>\u00a0NEVER LOOK DOWN &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.mentalhealthfilmfest.nyc\/upcomingfilms\/2015-films#\"&gt;<\/a>A young woman struggles with depression until her little sister with Down Syndrome shows her that each life is beautiful no matter what obstacles stand in the way.\u00a0 Their stories illustrate the beauty that each life inherently has.<\/p> <p>\u00a0HOW TO TOUCH A HOT STOVE &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.mentalhealthfilmfest.nyc\/upcomingfilms\/2015-films#\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;Featuring narration by actor John Turturro and exclusive interviews with Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel, Oliver Sacks, Temple Grandin, Elyn Saks, Susanna Kaysen, Joanne Greenberg, and others, \u201cHow to Touch a Hot Stove\u201d points to complex variations in human experience and differences in thinking, feeling, and perception. It identifies the new civil rights movement that has emerged to combat the marginalization of those with 'mental disorders', explores why that movement is more complex than other civil rights movements, and reveals the often disparate perspectives held both by professionals and those with lived experience -- as it challenges audiences to go 'beyond the movement' and make a difference!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Tickets begin at $25 for a session and $40 for the day and up.

We encourage creative offensive and defensive weapons, but NO use of fire, projectiles, chemical or electro-based systems. We reserve the right to refuse or demand modification to any drone deemed a potential hazard. Standard drone combat consists of two drones fighting head to head in a pre-defined arena. The objective is to knock the opponent\u2019s drone to the floor while avoiding your own drone hitting the floor. Combat starts with each drone ready-to-fly and idling in a designated landing zone or ring. At the sound of the buzzer, each drone lifts into the air.<\/p> <p>Each player begins with 3 points. One point is deducted each time a player\u2019s drone touches the floor. The first player to reach 0 points is declared the loser.<\/p> <p>Only drone-on-drone physical contact is permitted. Players may use flying, hitting and bashing to attempt to force the other drone into the ground. Drones may not use fire, projectiles, electric shocks\/signals or chemicals\/materials to interfere with the other drone. If combat results in both drones hitting the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other, then both players loses a point. However, a game-winning point or \u201ckill\u201d point can NOT be obtained if both drones hit the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other (ie. The winning drone must NOT hit the floor with 3 seconds of the losing drone hitting the floor for final kill point).<\/p> <p>Each time a drone crashes, Pilots have 90 seconds to lift off again. During this time they are permitted to enter the arena to make emergency repairs, replace batteries &amp; parts or make adjustments to their drone. Pilots have 90 seconds to get their drone flying or they are eliminated from the match. During this time the healthy drone is allowed to land and rest, but it must land upright and completely within it\u2019s starting zone or ring. If for any reason the drone hits the floor outside of the ring upon landing or otherwise crashes or can\u2019t lift-off again, it will lose a point as if it had crashed in combat.<\/p> <p>Matches end at 5 minutes. The drone with the highest score will be declared the winner. If there is a tie, the winner will be determined by tennis ball firing squad.<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE<br\/>=\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 FPV Racing INFO: \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022= Important FPV Guidelines:<br\/>For FPV racing, or any FPV event where multiple people are flying at the same time, it is best to keep the video transmitter frequencies separated as much as possible to allow as many flyers in the air at one time as possible. If you have a 5.8ghz setup, please be prepared to change your video transmitter to one of the following frequencies. Keep in mind that most transmitters default to channel 1, so it\u2019s best to pick another one so there are fewer conflicts. Preferred 5.8ghz band FPV Frequencies:<br\/>Boscam\/Fatshark = the manufacture and name for the more common frequency bands.<br\/>1st Number = the channel within that band<br\/>Number in parentheses = the boscam channel number on a 32 channel VTX\/VRX<br\/>Last Number = the actual frequency for that channel Boscam 4 (34) 5645ghz<br\/>Boscam 1 (31) 5707ghz **<br\/>Fatshark 1 (41) 5740ghz **<br\/>Fatshark 4 (44) 5800ghz<br\/>Fatshark 7 (47) 5860ghz<br\/>Boscam 8 (38) 5945ghz ** Only one person at a time can use these frequencies as they overlap We will have frequency tags and a whiteboard to help manage who can fly when. Please be considerate and do not power up your VTX if someone else is using that channel. Always check if that channel is being used and call out when you are about to power up so others can speak up if it is not a good time to do so. Even if you are on another channel, the power surge from turning on a transmitter is enough to disrupt someone else\u2019s video for a few seconds, which is all it takes to lose position and crash. PILOT FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT<br\/>(redundancy is safety!)<br\/>Since most pilots are using the Vtx (5.8ghz video transmitter) bands, please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark\/Immersion or Boscam) and channel. Here's the basics: 1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. 2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles\/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping. 3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video (unless you check in with the race coordinator first to add your frequency to the list.)<\/p> <p>4) For racing, the best spread of channels currently seems to be Fatshark\/Immersion channels 1, 4 and 7, and Boscam channels 1, 4 and 8. Everyone should initially set their transmitters to one of those channels.<\/p> <p>5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat. --------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Suggested equipment to bring: 1) Your aircraft(s) and ground station. Be prepared to let everyone know the frequencies you'll be using for your Tx, Vtx, etc. You may want bring your rig in a mobile chest of some kind with wheels, it is a small enjoyable hike each way.<\/p> <p>3) AMA License: (highly recommended if you are flying, you can get it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>)<\/p> <p>4) Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses. 5) Sunscreen and water. 6) BYOP - Bring Your Own Power generator, Batteries and charging station. There are no power outlets at this location.<\/p> <p>7) A fold out chair to sit comfortably while in FPV. GENERAL INFO: NO FLY ZONE: For safety, the no fly zone is anywhere outside the race track and infield. Please launch your aircraft at the edge or in the grass\/dirt area. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there's lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control. We have a 100% safety record and intend to keep it that way. FLY ZONE: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone as much as possible. Please pilot your aircraft from within the no-fly zone. If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intensions so other pilots can avoid you. CRASH &amp; TRASH: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless. KIDS: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear. RESPONSIBLE FLYING: Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.<\/p> <p>RACING: Please race at a speed and agility that you can comfortably maintain control of your rig. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx, etc.\" It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. And most important, have a blast of fun! Rotors Up! Looking forward to seeing you there!

We encourage creative offensive and defensive weapons, but NO use of fire, projectiles, chemical or electro-based systems. We reserve the right to refuse or demand modification to any drone deemed a potential hazard. Standard drone combat consists of two drones fighting head to head in a pre-defined arena. The objective is to knock the opponent\u2019s drone to the floor while avoiding your own drone hitting the floor. Combat starts with each drone ready-to-fly and idling in a designated landing zone or ring. At the sound of the buzzer, each drone lifts into the air.<\/p> <p>Each player begins with 3 points. One point is deducted each time a player\u2019s drone touches the floor. The first player to reach 0 points is declared the loser.<\/p> <p>Only drone-on-drone physical contact is permitted. Players may use flying, hitting and bashing to attempt to force the other drone into the ground. Drones may not use fire, projectiles, electric shocks\/signals or chemicals\/materials to interfere with the other drone. If combat results in both drones hitting the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other, then both players loses a point. However, a game-winning point or \u201ckill\u201d point can NOT be obtained if both drones hit the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other (ie. The winning drone must NOT hit the floor with 3 seconds of the losing drone hitting the floor for final kill point).<\/p> <p>Each time a drone crashes, Pilots have 90 seconds to lift off again. During this time they are permitted to enter the arena to make emergency repairs, replace batteries &amp; parts or make adjustments to their drone. Pilots have 90 seconds to get their drone flying or they are eliminated from the match. During this time the healthy drone is allowed to land and rest, but it must land upright and completely within it\u2019s starting zone or ring. If for any reason the drone hits the floor outside of the ring upon landing or otherwise crashes or can\u2019t lift-off again, it will lose a point as if it had crashed in combat.<\/p> <p>Matches end at 5 minutes. The drone with the highest score will be declared the winner. If there is a tie, the winner will be determined by tennis ball firing squad.<\/p> <p>Pilots click here to register: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/dSports\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/dSports<\/a> PLEASE NOTE<br\/>=\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 FPV Racing INFO: \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022= Important FPV Guidelines:<br\/>For FPV racing, or any FPV event where multiple people are flying at the same time, it is best to keep the video transmitter frequencies separated as much as possible to allow as many flyers in the air at one time as possible. If you have a 5.8ghz setup, please be prepared to change your video transmitter to one of the following frequencies. Keep in mind that most transmitters default to channel 1, so it\u2019s best to pick another one so there are fewer conflicts.

Please be considerate and do not power up your VTX if someone else is using that channel. Always check if that channel is being used and call out when you are about to power up so others can speak up if it is not a good time to do so. Even if you are on another channel, the power surge from turning on a transmitter is enough to disrupt someone else\u2019s video for a few seconds, which is all it takes to lose position and crash.

If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video (unless you check in with the race coordinator first to add your frequency to the list.)<\/p> <p>4) For racing, the best spread of channels currently seems to be Fatshark\/Immersion channels 1, 4 and 7, and Boscam channels 1, 4 and 8. Everyone should initially set their transmitters to one of those channels.<\/p> <p>5) Please arrange the\u00a0video transmitter\u00a0on your aircraft so that the dip switches\/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TD0ftmZsji8\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TD0ftmZsji8<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>--------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Suggested equipment to bring:\u00a0<\/p> <p>1) Your aircraft(s) and ground station. Be prepared to let everyone know the frequencies you'll be using for your Tx, Vtx, etc. You may want bring your rig in a mobile chest of some kind with wheels, it is a small enjoyable hike each way.<\/p> <p>3) AMA License: (highly recommended if you are flying, you can get it here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/)\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.modelaircraft.org\/<\/a>)<\/a><\/p> <p>4) Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses.\u00a0<\/p> <p>5) Sunscreen and water.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6) BYOP - Bring Your Own Power generator, Batteries and charging station. There are no power outlets at this location.<\/p> <p>7) A fold out chair to sit comfortably while in FPV.\u00a0<\/p> <p>GENERAL INFO:\u00a0<\/p> <p>NO FLY ZONE:\u00a0For safety, the no fly zone is anywhere outside the race track and infield. Please launch your aircraft at the edge or in the grass\/dirt area. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash\/buzz everyone, there's lots of pilots \"blind\" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control. We have a 100% safety record and intend to keep it that way.\u00a0<\/p> <p>FLY ZONE:\u00a0All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone as much as possible.\u00a0Please pilot your aircraft from within the no-fly zone.\u00a0If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intensions so other pilots can avoid you.\u00a0<\/p> <p>CRASH &amp; TRASH:\u00a0Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless.\u00a0<\/p> <p>KIDS:\u00a0we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. \u00a0For ground\/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous\/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. \u00a0It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear. \u00a0<\/p> <p>RESPONSIBLE FLYING:\u00a0Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together.<\/p> <p>RACING:\u00a0Please race at a speed and agility that you can comfortably maintain control of your rig. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are \"Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx, etc.\" It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. And most important, have a blast of fun! \u00a0<\/p> <p>Rotors Up! Looking forward to seeing you there!\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>(Special thanks to Scot &amp; Kevin for helping with the rules and\u00a0guidelines )<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AerialSports\/events\/224595548\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"duration":115200000,"name":"Aerial Sports League NYC Drone Games @ World Maker Faire, 2015","id":"224595548","time":1443286800000,"updated":1443403845000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1384286114000,"name":"Aerial Sport League (ASL)","group_lon":-122.38999939,"id":11078462,"urlname":"AerialSports","group_lat":37.7400016785,"who":"sport pilots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Montclair","address_1":"7 S Fullerton Ave","name":"East Side Mags","lon":-74.217728,"id":23548665,"lat":40.813698,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.7271261215,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434732201000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Batman Day 2015 is upon us! \u00a0Come out to East Side Mags for a day of fun-filled Batman-related goodies!<\/p> <p><br\/>We've got a ton of stuff going on so strap in and get ready: \u00a0HERE COMES BATMAN DAY!<\/p> <p><br\/>-Awesome Batman-themed coloring sheets, crossword puzzles, word-searches and more table activities<\/p> <p><br\/>-Batman-themed trivia contest starting at 4pm until 7pm<\/p> <p><br\/>-All Day Batman Raffle ($5 entry, winners announced on Sunday, 9\/27) with Batman-themed prizes includes comics, novelty items, posters and more!<\/p> <p><br\/>-A special Batman movie double feature where instead of charging admission we'll be asking attendees to bring canned, healthy food for donation to Toni's Kitchen Food Pantry here in Montclair, NJ! \u00a0Be like Batman and help those in need!<\/p> <p><br\/>-Rumor has it that Batman might be here IN PERSON! \u00a0Keep your eye out and let us know if you spot him!<\/p> <p><br\/>-Come to East Side Mags in Batman-related cosplay\/costumes and get DOUBLE STAMPS on your purchases! \u00a0Ask us for details!<\/p> <p>UPDATE (9\/25\/15): \u00a0We have 2 major announcements for all you Bat-Fans out there!<\/p> <p><br\/>*Stephen Coughlin will be here from 4pm-7pm to sketch for our customers! \u00a0Stephen is the amazing (and Montclair-local) artist\/writer of Sanctuary, an all-ages graphic novel! \u00a0 Come say hi and get a cool sketch!<\/p> <p><br\/>*We have our BIG raffle prize announced! \u00a0Enter the raffle ($5 per entry) and you can win some BIG Batman merch!!! \u00a0See images posted here for the GRAND RAFFLE PRIZE!<\/p> <p><br\/>*Batman Trivia will take place between 4pm-7pm! \u00a0Prizes a-plenty!!!<\/p> <p><br\/>*SAVE on all our Batman merchandise!<\/p> <p>**10% off all Batman related toys and apparel<\/p> <p>**20% off all Batman trade paperbacks and hardcovers<\/p> <p>**30% off all Batman back issues (does not include wall books or indie art work)<\/p> <p>\n\nSee you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/eastsidemags\/events\/223359759\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Batman Day 2015","id":"223359759","time":1443276000000,"updated":1443289198000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420211737000,"name":"East Side Mags","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":18291451,"urlname":"eastsidemags","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Mags"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Queens","address_1":" 47-01 111th Street","name":"New York Hall of Science in Queens","lon":-73.851433,"id":24082925,"state":"NY","lat":40.747177,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.27039670944,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441836243000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/5\/0\/600_441812336.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>PicoTurbine will be at the 2015 NYC MakerFaire!

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

The Law is summed up in two phrases from the Book:<\/p> <p>\u201cDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201d (AL I:40) and<br\/>\u201cLove is the law, love under will\u201d (AL I:57).<\/p> <p>The central goal of a Thelemite (as adherents refer to themselves) is to discover and perform his or her True Will, which is generally defined as the innermost Nature or proper life course of the individual. The techniques used to achieve this goal fall under the heading of Magick.<\/p> <p>Time of the workshop to be announced.<\/p> <p>We will be at our table through the day.<\/p> <p>We will not be meeting at our regular time today; only at the Pagan Pride Festival.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will have a table with our banner and a photo of Aleister Crowley.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Aiwass-Study-Group\/events\/224837906\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":21600000,"name":"Aiwass at Pagan Pride","id":"224837906","time":1443279600000,"updated":1443303598000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1124484061000,"name":"Aiwass Study Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":207532,"urlname":"Aiwass-Study-Group","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Thelemites"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":19.0593948364,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442844975000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>National Alpaca Farm Days is almost here and Bluebird Farm Alpacas in Peapack, NJ is getting ready for our open house weekend on Saturday, September 26th and Sunday, September 27th from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m!

The walks are being offered in partnership with the Fort Greene Park Conservancy.<\/p> <p>The tours begin in Fort Greene Park at 11am on the final Saturday of the month from May through September 2015.<\/p> <p>The guided walk will explore 400 years of history through the area\u2019s historic architecture and landmarks and will venture into the neighborhood\u2019s beautiful mix of pre-Civil War homes and late 19th century industrial district just outside the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The tour will focus on how the neighborhood has developed from when the Dutch first arrived in the early 1600\u2019s and highlight notable residents, such as Author Walt Whitman and Doo-Wop Singer Little Anthony. Information on Whitman, along with the reciting of some of his works during the tour, is provided by the Walt Whitman Project and the American Opera Projects.<\/p> <p>Many local residents are aware of some of the neighborhood\u2019s notable historic events or people, such as the Prison Ship Martyrs\u2019 Monument and Walt Whitman, but many lesser known stories are widely unknown. The tour will highlight these stories. For example, the tour will pass the home of the first professional baseball player, the birthplace of Michael Jordan, and The Chocolate Factory, a factory that once made Tootsie Rolls.<\/p> <p>The tour includes a 1.5 walk, beginning in Fort Greene Park and concluding at 99 Ryerson St. The event is FREE, but space is limited and registration is required.<\/p> <p>Spaces are still available on the May, June, July, August and September tours.

And, last week\u00a0we talked about Investigation\u00a0as the discernment of wholesome or unwholesome aspects of our relationship to experiences and mind states.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Energy, the third factor, is both the capacity for action and our ability to act. There are many nuanced aspects of energy. It is the strength we\u00a0utilize\u00a0to stay resolute, to persevere and to persist as we cultivate and grow in wisdom. Energy is also the\u00a0courage we need to face challenges for the sake of our intended accomplishment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Since we use energy in all of our activities, we can be mindful as to whether we are using our energy skillfully or not. This is where we can grow in wisdom and find balance with\u00a0the\u00a0effort we bring to our experience.\u00a0For example, if our energy is low, do we make an effort to engage or fall into inaction?\u00a0Are we staying in our comfort zone and not growing in wisdom? Conversely, are we pushing too hard and our mind state is rigid and prone to self-judgment? How do we find the energy that arises naturally when we are open, balanced\u00a0and at ease?\"<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

Start investing in yourself by treating yourself right. I can't tell you how many times I didn't feel like doing yoga but how great I felt afterwards.<\/p> <p>Think about how you have an opportunity to do yoga in a community setting, meet like-minded people, and support a local business at the same time!<\/p> <p>I would like to continue the yoga and would love to see more benders. Please take advantage of this opportunity because it may not be here for long. See you on Saturday.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

A group of interested parties (the \u201cWorking Group\u201d) met in August 2008 to explore the creation of a new museum of mathematics \u2014 one that would go well beyond the Goudreau in both its scope and methodology. The group quickly discovered that there was no museum of mathematics in the United States, and yet there was incredible demand for hands-on math programming. Accomplishments to date include: opening Manhattan\u2019s only hands-on science center, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors; creating the popular Math Midway exhibition, which delighted over 750,000 visitors at museums throughout the United States; leading math tours in various U.S. cities; running dozens of Math Encounters and Family Fridays presentations; delivering many other programs for students, teachers, and the public to increase appreciation of mathematics; and creating the largest public outdoor demonstration of the Pythagorean Theorem ever.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-math\/events\/223216142\/","yes_rsvp_count":36,"duration":10800000,"name":"FIELD TRIP: Museum of Mathematics","id":"223216142","time":1443286800000,"updated":1443300163000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293578639000,"name":"Math for Math's Sake!","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1755448,"urlname":"nyc-math","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Pythagoreans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432076250000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mini_Adventures\/events\/223940633\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":10800000,"name":"FREE EVENT Play badminton & volleyball outdoors w Good Music (New Date Setp 26)","id":"bgsdhlytkbjc","time":1443286800000,"updated":1443300167000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1168846446000,"name":"Mini Adventures For Free - Hiking, Dancing, Sports & More","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":404476,"urlname":"Mini_Adventures","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Adventure Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"338 West 46th Street","name":"Sangria 46 Restaurant","lon":-73.989418,"id":5043842,"state":"NY","lat":40.760281,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.712340533733,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441465120000,"rating":{"count":8,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are going to have a scrumptious mid-afternoon lunch\/brunch of the best food ever!!

Written in what DeLillo calls \"super-omniscience\" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter\u2014the \"shot heard around the world\"\u2014and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand.<\/p> <p>\"It's all falling indelibly into the past,\" writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that \"global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways,\" and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.<\/p> <p>Through fragments and interlaced stories\u2014including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others\u2014DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Queens-Literati\/events\/223638836\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"September --  Underworld by Don DeLillo","id":"223638836","time":1443286800000,"updated":1443395336000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1245713588000,"name":"The Queens Literati","group_lon":-73.8799972534,"id":1477759,"urlname":"The-Queens-Literati","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Humble Bookworms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11231","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"253 Smith Street","name":"La Casita Yarn Shop","lon":-73.992521,"id":1161940,"state":"NY","lat":40.683073,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.6356716156,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432048306000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The 2015 NYC Yarn Crawl will be held Friday, September 25 thru Sunday September 27.

In New York, the opera, the theatre, and grand parties consumed the ruling class' leisure hours. Sherry's Restaurant hosted formal horseback dinners for the New York Riding Club. Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish once threw a dinner party to honor her dog who arrived sporting a $15,000 diamond collar. Millionaires built\u00a0stately and often gaudy homes in New York City. For example,\u00a0the childhood home of Huguette Clark, built in 1907 by her father,\u00a0William Andrews Clark, had 121 rooms, 31 baths, four art galleries, a swimming pool, and a private underground rail line to bring in coal for heating. It cost Clark $7M\u2014that's about $162M in today's dollars\u2014to build, but stood for only 20 years, bought by a developer after Clark's death for less than half the construction cost and demolished to make way for a wealthy apartment house at 960 Fifth Avenue.<\/p> <p>On this walking tour, we will discuss rich people's\u00a0grand\u00a0mansions, wraparound terraces,\u00a0extravagant weddings,\u00a0lavish parties, oversized carriage houses, conspicuous leisure,\u00a0costly hobbies, spacious apartments, prissy\u00a0social clubs, and wealth fest.<\/p> <p><b>This is a walking tour with much commentary.\u00a0We'll be walking about 2 1\/2\u00a0miles. We will be zigzagging around historic Carnegie Hill and the Upper East Side. There will be plenty of stopping at points of interest. If you don't like a lot of stopping, then this type of walk is not good for you. The tour lasts about 2 hours and\u00a020 minutes.<\/b><\/p> <p>Below was the Carnegies\u2019 organ in the reception hall.

Make sure you don't miss this meetup as our buddy and the founder of this group Matt will be back in town and chilling with us until we decide we're sick of him (read: never).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pokemondsnyc\/events\/225396445\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":14400000,"name":"PokemonDSNYC Meetup September 2015: The Return of Pokemon Jesus","id":"225396445","time":1443290400000,"updated":1443307456000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1301957535000,"name":"Pokemon DS Meetup NYC","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1809892,"urlname":"pokemondsnyc","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Pokefans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"72 Noble Street","name":"Brooklyn Expo Center","lon":-73.958214,"id":23797833,"state":"NY","lat":40.728321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.24326252937,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440691577000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi ladies!<\/p> <p>It's been a while since we've hit up a good ole' beer fest, so let's check out the Brooklyn Pour!
