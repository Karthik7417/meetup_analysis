Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a012\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0 12\/29\u00a0 Stephen Clarke<\/p> <p>1\/5\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/12\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/26\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>2\/2\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\/9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/23\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>3\/1 \u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/8 \u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

While the talk is focused on using OpenVPN in a home environment, the topic will be applicable to utilizing it in small businesses and with providers on the internet.<\/p> <p>What this talk will not cover is the maths behind the encryption technology; it will be called magic and just assumed to work as expected. If you have a specific question[s] you would like me to [try to] address during my talk, please feel free to send me an email directly or reply to this post.<\/p> <p>The meeting will take place at OmniTI, located in Fulton, MD. The ddress is 11830 West Market Place Fulton, MD 20759. The building is located near the Harris Teeter, easily seen as you approach on rt 216.

We do not currently have a piza sponsor, so if you or someone you know is interested sponsoring this for us, please contact me directly. Until a new sponsor is found we will ask those partaking in the food and drink to make a donation (not required) to help offset the cost.

This length of presentation allows for Q&amp;A time from those in attendance. The members are a friendly group and we welcome topic on Linux, IT security, and related fields of interest to the group.<\/p> <p><br\/>When there is not a presenter we hold an open discussion meeting for members to talk about any topic which comes up.<\/p> <p>Our meetings are held at the offices of OmniTI in Fulton, MD. From 6:30-7:00pm we enjoy some social time over pizza and soda. The presentations start about 7pm and last until they are done. The meetings generally wind up about 9pm.<\/p> <p>If you are presenting at a Con, to your office, want to practice your public speaking, or just want to present on a topic that you are learning about please feel free to contact us.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter the building anywhere and follow the Columbia Insight Meditation signs to the room","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group\/events\/227564452\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":5400000,"name":"Insight Meditation Class","id":"cjtwjlyvdbnb","time":1455150600000,"updated":1455157996000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334625474000,"name":"Columbia Insight Meditation Group","group_lon":-76.8700027466,"id":3684172,"urlname":"Columbia-Insight-Meditation-Group","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"20715","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bowie","address_1":"3209 Stonybrook Drive","lon":-76.745195,"phone":"301-464-1737","name":"Bowie Community Center","id":1098031,"state":"MD","lat":38.986055,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.0913066864,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428343868000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/0\/e\/600_435374350.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Ooooo you gorgeous people!

Bring plenty of business cards and your appetite for a hot breakfast and structured networking.<\/p> <p>Here's how it works: When you arrive, check in, grab your name badge, and take a seat. Breakfast will be announced shortly after you get settled (you may be able to grab a coffee before the food comes out). Make sure you are sitting with people that are new to you! Your first \"rotation\" will be with the initial people at your table, so introduce yourself, share information, and collect\/distribute business cards. Welcome announcements and acknowledgements will take place, followed by two or three more rounds of networking. Each round will require you to get up from your chair and relocate yourself to another table where you will start the process all over again! Depending on the number at your table, you will have between 60 and 90 seconds to introduce yourself and tell your tablemates about your business, so prepare and practice your \"elevator speech\" early! This breakfast is hosted by the Northern Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce and will be attended by numerous chambers and business groups.<br\/>Networking and Connecting<br\/>Did you know that Entrepreneur's Exchange introduced the concept of the \"joint breakfast\" years ago? It's like speed dating but you meet 8 to 10 new people in each round. EE participates in six or more joint networking breakfasts each year at different locations throughout the Baltimore\/Washington area, traditionally hosting the summer breakfast in Annapolis in June. Other participating organizations include local chambers of commerce, business networking groups, technology groups, and more. Don't miss the opportunity to meet business owners and entrepreneurs from around the area and make a lot of connections - sign up for the next joint breakfast and see what all the buzz is about!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entrepreneurs-Exchange-Meetup\/events\/228059550\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Joint Chamber Networking Breakfast","id":"228059550","time":1455193800000,"updated":1455226212000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1392246230000,"name":"Entrepreneur's Exchange Meetup","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":12854102,"urlname":"Entrepreneurs-Exchange-Meetup","group_lat":39,"who":"Entrepreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":14.9994421005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453838124000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Leaders of the Roundtable<\/b> is a membership fee based organization that meets once a month for CEO's.<\/p> <p>If you would like to inquire about membership email Tim at [masked] or call[masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>OUR MISSION<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0Why make those critical business decisions on your own, or by the opinion of one?

Auburn Cemetery, originally named 'The City of the Dead for Colored People'.<\/p> <p>Mount Auburn Cemetery is the oldest owned and operated African-American cemetery in Baltimore City. This burial ground was founded in 1868 and the deed was signed by the Reverend James Peck, Pastor and the Trustees of Sharp Street Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872. For a number of years it was the only cemetery in Baltimore City where African-Americans could be buried in dignity.<\/p> <p>Mount Auburn Cemetery is the continuation of a tradition begun in 1810. The Reverend Peck and the Trustees of Sharp Street Church purchased land in Mount Winans to continue this tradition for members of the African American community. The land was officially dedicated and named, \"The City of the Dead for Colored People.\" The name was changed to Mount Auburn Cemetery in 1894. The Cemetery was incorporated January 4, 1982. Today, Mount Auburn Cemetery exists as a monument to our history and heritage. It is the resting place of Joseph Gains, first African-American light heavyweight boxing champion; Lillie Carroll Jackson, civil rights activist; William Ashbie Hawkins, first African-American to run for the United States Senate in Maryland; John Henry Murphy, founder of the Afro American Newspaper; freed slaves; and other persons from all walks of life.<\/p> <p>Mount Auburn Cemetery was designated a Historic Landmark in Baltimore City in 1986 and an Historic Site in 2001 on the National Register of Historic Places.\"<\/p> <p>This visit will be a nice way for the Grave Friends of Baltimore to honor and appreciate and further educate ourselves about the rich and diverse cultural history of our African-American community, past and present, here in Baltimore.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\".

Paper Love by Sarah Wildman is the book written by the author we went to hear a few months ago at chizuk Amuno. \"Years after her grandfather's death, journalist Sarah Wildman stumbled upon a cache of letters in a file labeled \"Correspondence: Patients A-G.\" But instead of dry medical histories, she found a trove of letters connecting her to the past, including letters from Valy - Valerie Scheftel, her grandfather's lover who had remained behind when he fled Europe six months after the Nazis annexed Austria. Valy's name wasn't unknown to her - Wildman had once asked her grandmother about a dark haired young woman whose images she found in an old photo album ,and had been told \"She was your Grandfather's true love.\" Now, with the help of the letters, Wildman discovered a woman desperate to escape and clinging to the memory of a love that defined her years of freedom. Obsessed with Valy's story, Wildman began a quest that lasted years and spanned continents. She found an entire world of people searching for the same woman.

Many groups compete for power, sometimes working together, but often at odds as schemes progress and alliances form and unravel. Thrown into this volatile mix is the Cult of the Dragon,a cabal of dragon-obsessed zealots whose plans go much deeper than the power struggles of mortals. While each mini-adventure takes place against the\u00a0backdrop of the struggles in Phlan, none focus too closely on any of Phlan\u2019s plots or sites. Each gives just a small taste of the deeper troubles in Phlan, instead focusing on giving the players a fun, quick mission that can be completed in less than an hour.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe first 1\/2 hour of the meetup will be meet and greet and character builds<\/p> <p>use these site to assist you in this Endeavour<\/p> <p>\n\n\nD&amp;D 5e Basic Rules (Player's Guide):\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/2015\/downloads\/dnd\/BasicRules_Playerv3.4.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/2015\/downloads\/dnd\/BasicRules_Playerv3.4.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/2015\/downloads\/dnd\/BasicRules_Playerv3.4.pdf<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>D&amp;D Basic Set Pre-Gen Characters:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/downloads\/dnd\/StarterSet_Characters.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/downloads\/dnd\/StarterSet_Characters.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/media.wizards.com\/downloads\/dnd\/StarterSet_Characters.pdf<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>AL Legal Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide Races \/ Classes \/ Backgrounds:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/dndadventurersleague.org\/the-sword-coast-adventurers-guide-and-you\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dndadventurersleague.org\/the-sword-coast-adventurers-guide-and-you\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/dndadventurersleague.org\/the-sword-coast-adventurers-guide-and-you\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Blank Character Sheets:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/features\/character_sheets\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/features\/character_sheets\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/features\/character_sheets<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Maryland-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Adventure-League\/events\/228830235\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":14400000,"name":"Defiance in Phlan  ADL-- DDEX 1-1","id":"228830235","time":1455663600000,"updated":1455712020000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1414526009000,"name":"Baltimore Maryland Dungeons and Dragons Adventure League","group_lon":-76.3000030518,"id":17925552,"urlname":"Baltimore-Maryland-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Adventure-League","group_lat":39.4700012207,"who":"Adventures"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21212","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"5851 York Road, 21212","lon":-76.60994,"phone":"410-889-6005","name":"Amazing Spiral","id":18099092,"state":"MD","lat":39.362984,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.08164262772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413986047000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tuesday Night Magic Event!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>(We also do, Friday Night Magic Tournaments, every other Wednesday and Pre- and Release Parties on Saturdays)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please join us for Tuesday'[\\ Night Magic<\/b><\/p> <p><b>6pm sign up<\/b><\/p> <p><b>6:30 start time<\/b><\/p> <p><b>cost: $15 \u00a0(Pay by cash or credit card when you come to Amazing Spiral)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>$5 if you bring 3 booster packs<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gaming-Community\/members\/136069892\/\">David Wright<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Format for these events is Draft.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a012\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0 12\/29\u00a0 Stephen Clarke<\/p> <p>1\/5\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/12\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1\/26\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>2\/2\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\/9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\/23\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>3\/1 \u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/8 \u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

We encourage international interacting by providing channels for communications and exchange. They do this through programs providing cultural training for teachers and students; empowering students to be world leaders; developing ambassador teams in communities; opportunities for direct public interaction with people from around the world; and hosting in communities and homes. One of their annual events is an International Film Festival. This year we will see films from Israel, Slovakia, Philippines, Panama, and Syria. The films are co-sponsored by their respective embassies and introduced by someone associated with the project. All films will be shown Tuesday nights at 7pm at Maryland Hall (probably downstairs in the gym like last year). They will all be shown at various venues around the DC\/Baltimore metro area as well.

What he finds is beyond his wildest imagination. Filmed in magical Mt. Shasta and Northern California, his adventure into the heart of the North West wilderness becomes a quest to realize his highest potential. Based on ancient prophecy, contemporary truth seeking and the future of spirituality, The Last Avatar is a film that takes transformational and spiritual themes and makes them exciting for audiences of all ages.<\/p> <p>Filled with love, magic, mystery, prophecy, conspiracy, psychics, underground cities, secret societies, light bodies and much more. The Last Avatar tells the story of the discovery and emergence of Kalki Avatar- the final Avatar of our current Age of Chaos. Kalki is also a metaphor for the innate power and potential that lies within humanity to awaken and create a world of truth, harmony and possibility. In the words of Kalki Avatar, \u201cWe are becoming conscious of our power to re-make the world.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Last Avatar gets to the heart of how the world got into this mess and how we get out.\u201d<br\/>~ David Icke, Author and Public Speaker<\/p> <p>\u201c A visionary, metaphysical feature film with a strong message and plenty of action\u2026 a colorful tapestry woven with the best from Eastern and Western religious and prophetic cosmologies. All this, in a compelling story that will hold your interest to the very end. This is a film that is itself a wake up call. It encourages us to divest ourselves of negative programming and move into higher planes with the help of our light bodies. It addresses the chaos that is happening in the world today and suggests a solution.<br\/>After watching this film for the second time, I had the very same feeling I had after watching Little Buddha (1993). I was inspired, I was tingling with energy, and so very, very happy. I recommend this film to all that are looking for a possible solution to and a definite escape from chaos, both in their own lives and in the world.\u201d<br\/>~ Jennifer Hoskins, New Dawn Magazine<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS\/events\/228482247\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"IONS Movie Night: The Last Avatar featuring Neale Donald Walsch","id":"228482247","time":1455753600000,"updated":1455760191000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421254044000,"name":"Baltimore Friends of IONS","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18334650,"urlname":"Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Psychonauts, Explorers, Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bel Air","address_1":"17 N Main Street","name":"Collector's Corner","lon":-76.349777,"id":23682023,"state":"MD","lat":39.537163,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":6,"distance":22.3997421265,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455285701000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>An unexpected envoy arrives in Sporedome and offers to give aid against the fire giants of Maeri-mydra, if you are willing to help his people with a small problem.<\/p> <p>This is an adventure for PCs level 5-10.<\/p> <p>Dungeon and Dragons Encounters run every Wednesday from 7pm - 9pm at the Collector's Corner Outpost in Bel Air, Maryland.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch - \"Scout\" - returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\",\u00a0<b>Go Set a Watchman<\/b>\u00a0perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past - a journey that can only be guided by one's own conscience.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWritten in the mid-1950s,\u00a0Go Set a Watchman\u00a0imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision - a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of\u00a0To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/9\/0\/600_446135728.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Since our discussion is held at the Nordstrom Market Cafe, I plan on enjoying dinner during our discussion.

During Satsang we open up to the guidance of a True Master and welcome his grace to open our hearts to what is already always there.<\/p> <p><b>cost: donations are welcome<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you want to learn more about Mooji's pointings watch this:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cgxGqINlh48\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cgxGqINlh48\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cgxGqINlh48<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Watch this video from Mooji as he describes the value of Satsang and what it can bring to your life:<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cgxGqINlh48\">&lt;\/a&gt;<br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOv8LdCjTyo&amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOv8LdCjTyo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOv8LdCjTyo&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>This event will occur for First and third Thursday of each month. \u00a0<br\/>Next gathering will take place\u00a0March\u00a03rd\u00a0and 17th.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Organizer of this Event: David Utts<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/536554093189535\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/536554093189535\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/536554093189535\/<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><i>***Night of this event, please contact presenters at the information above to ensure questions will be addressed promptly.\u00a0Receptionist not available to answer calls in the evenings and messages will be returned the next day.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donuts driveway","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/228481999\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Mooji Sangha Satsang gathering","id":"228481999","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455848433000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":12.8690757751,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455376627000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In this 1.5-hour MeetUp, you will receive:\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>-----a history of this revolutionary program\u00a0<br\/>-----a free assessment of your current walking patterns\u00a0<br\/>-----a demonstration of common incorrect walking habits.<\/p> <p>The following areas of your life may and can be improved by Secrets of Natural Walking:\u00a0<\/p> <p>--Pain in your joints\/back\/neck?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>--Diabetes, high blood pressure, digestive system disorder?<\/p> <p>--Out of shape?\u00a0<\/p> <p>--Stressed?

With the recent death of their father Colonel Prozorov, they await a return to Moscow where the elusive \"good life\" can begin again.<\/p> <p>Chekhov's works (The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard) are often seen as the last echo of a fading classic Russian literary tradition before Stalinism made \"socialist realism\" into a suffocating orthodoxy.<\/p> <p>Chekhov, having been a product himself of an abusive broken home, had a keen understanding of trauma, human nature, dysfunction, and the irony of existence, which is expertly portrayed in this glimpse into the life of one tragic Russian family.<\/p> <p>Tickets <a href=\"https:\/\/web.ovationtix.com\/trs\/pesptpm\/10034707\/1057263\">here <\/a>$25-40.

His voice is sometimes described as wildly erotic, soulful, loving, and deep. and his Midas Touch seems to be constant: if you can get Roland on your track, its going to be magic. Roland also carved himself a nice slice of house music\u2019s pie with his phenomenal deejaying and production skills. His contributions infuse many artists best works, including Bob Sinclair, Armand Van Helden's gorgeous \"Flowerz.\" Not surprising, though it is another track blessed by the voice of Roland Clark. Quite simply, Roland Clark has carved-out his place in history as the voice of House Music. Quote: \"If House is a nation, I Wanna Be President!\" ( DJ Roland Clark) much like a undeniable storm working with such deejays and other producers much like himself such as Todd Terry, Kenny Dope, Mark Knight, Bad Boy Bill, Meat Katie, Sandy Rivera , Terry Hunter and Rodger Sanchez, Noir, Soul Dynamic, George Morel, and Erick Morillo just to name a few.. Roland sounds if need be compared would be much like a chameleon going from a soulful sultriness to a hard house and techno. He has been sometimes pegged as the Nate Dogg of house, or house music\u2019s laureate.and most notable these days are his deejay skills and the way he gets the crowd begging for more well after the lights come on. Whatever his title or which hat he has on that day be sure that this man is just beginning after all these years and will be a force to be reckoned with in the now and future.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mixcloud.com\/djrolandclark\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.mixcloud.com\/djrolandclark\/<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>ALSO ROCKING THE DECKS WILL BE :<\/p> <p>DJ TONY SMOOTH- ( TRIBETRONIX<br\/>DJ V COCH- ( MILK CHOCOLATE CITY)<br\/>DJ PAUL HOWARD-(MILK CHOCOLATE CITY)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/housemusic-54\/events\/228612543\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":16200000,"name":"FRI.

My heart raced as I was so excited that I would be meeting my baby but so unprepared. I was low fluid I was told. We hadn't put the crib together and hadn't finished washing cloths or organizing things for the baby. Fortunately they sent me home after giving me extra fluids. But I only lasted three more days before they brought me back. At least this time we had the crib assembled and cloths washed and a hospital bag packed. But little did I think about the impact three weeks early can have on a child and how much added stress that places on a parent when there kid is not keeping up with other kids and not meeting milestones. There was a point when they sent us to Hopkins because my boys head measurements weren't increasing fast enough. Fortunately all was fine with his head. Riley was also an often sick child with several cases of pneumonia that sent us to the hospital because he couldn't breath and had reactive airway disease, similar to asthma. Riley has been lucky to be born in Howard County where there is so much support. He was born low tone which was why he was not making milestone markers. With the help of infants and toddlers which I recommend the support of for any mom he has grown out of physical therapy and has even recently learned to jump a very hard skill for a boy who has low tone. He has also tested out of needing speech therapy, and graduates out of infants and toddlers at age three which means no special education services are needed at this time. He has come a very long way. When I first talked to Judy (of Healthy Families) my boy was three months of age and I was told he was too big for the program. I was thinking how lost we were and how small he was. We took him to the library and because he was low tone and a floppy baby some parent said to me is he even aloud out of the hospital and laughed at me for even taking my three month old out of the house to the library. He was small having been born early and he was floppy having been born low tone. I actually never participated in Healthy Families Howard County. But wished I could have been a part of it as I really think with a boy like Riley I really needed it. So when I started the group because I had registered my three month old in the healthy families class which is not aloud (even though if we went by his due date he would have qualified for the program) I became some how included in the email list of moms. The first mom to touch base with me was Katie who was so encouraging. She is quiet and attended only a handful of meetups, but little is she aware that her one email started this whole meetup. I invited the entire group of moms from the email she sent me (which was all the moms in the healthy families program) to come to my meetup group since I could not come to there group. I was already a long time fan of meetup as a runner and member of a running group. So starting my own group was treading on familiar territory plus I am a teacher so leading is not so unfamiliar either. Starting with just those moms from Healthy Families and building from there I made it my mission to let every new mom know about the Healthy Families program, and have kept it a recurring meetup. I have networked with business partners that support healthy families such as Greenberries, the Yoga Center of Columbia, and Olenka School of Music. My main goal of this fundraiser is to ensure that other new moms do not miss this opportunity, as for me dealing with an early birth and so many issues I didn't even learn about the program until my boy was too old. My goal is increased awareness about the program for new first time moms (better advertising). Also to connect this meetup group with the program (don't know if this is possible yet or how.) But I believe in possibilities and this fundraiser is a start in making changes to better serve new moms from 90 days and onward through this meetup groups continuance beyond me. This year I gave birth to my 2nd and last child. Everett seems like superman after having a low tone baby, although looking at other children he seems more average. Because this is my last child I will not be a new mom or parent of a toddler forever but would like a place where moms could meet authentically to make lasting friendships to be a forever. I am still trying to make that real as I transition on with my life and my kids as they journey on ward. I don't want to forget those moments when I was a first time mom and don't want to forget those new first time moms that come after me as there will be more Riley's who need extra help, and their parents who need extra support. And I'm sure to any first time mom we all need support some days, although I'm finding as a 2nd time mom so soon (with still a very needy tot) we are just crazy at this point. Please support the mission of this group by supporting this fundraiser, and if you read this far, congratulations for being probably the only one and thank you.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Moms-of-Columbia-MD\/events\/228544065\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"Healthly Families Howard County Fundraiser","id":"228544065","time":1455978600000,"updated":1455985738000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1380331503000,"name":"New Moms and Parents of Toddlers of Columbia MD","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":10458782,"urlname":"New-Moms-of-Columbia-MD","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Moms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"21045","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"6800 Cradlerock Way","lon":-76.840939,"phone":"4435353018","name":"Owen Brown Community Center","id":776714,"state":"MD","lat":39.193601,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":13.5974941254,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455635907000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come to the Cradlerock Community Center in Support of Healthy Families Howard County.

Experiment with both low cost &amp; high end setups. Each student will be able to use their own camera and take their own images to be processed. Bring your camera, tripod, and preferably a macro or long lens. Reb will demonstrate different types of lighting techniques. You will learn the results of what happens when milk (or cream) is substituted for water or when additives are added to the water. Experiment with colored water! See the difference in the splash in a shallow pan versus a deeper pan. Increase the size of the water drops and watch what happens.<\/p> <p>Make sure you have a few large memory cards and extra batteries for your camera. Feel free to bring your own flash unit(s) to try. Using colored film, we\u2019ll experiment with different colored light sources as well as changing the size or the water drops, the interval between the time the water drops, and when the camera fires.<\/p> <p>After everyone has had a lot of time shooting, Reb will then teach you his processing technique for water drops.

This book is a great entry point for westerners who are looking to understand the Buddhist path. It is pithy, \u00a0and adapted to our cultural understanding. Here is a brief description from Rinpoche about the contents of this book:<\/p> <p>\"There\u2019s a rebel within you. It\u2019s the part of you that already knows how to break free of fear and unhappiness. This rebel is the voice of your own awakened mind. It\u2019s your rebel buddha\u2014the sharp, clear intelligence that resists the status quo.

(Not a bad thing to know how to do, right?)<\/p> <p>We'll go through a step-by-step progression to make sure you have each of the critical components of bracing nailed down. We will then do a series of drills and exercises to help build automatic bracing into your muscle memory.<\/p> <p>These sessions are a lot of fun and, since you'll be learning bracing, you can expect to make mistakes and get wet! But that's part of the fun too!<\/p> <p>The skills instruction will be for 90 minutes. You will then have an additional 20-30 minutes of pool time to practice what you've learned, or practice other skills, or just chill out.<\/p> <p>The classes are small with just four students. This insures that you will get plenty of attention during the session.<\/p> <p>Rick Wiebush will be the instructor.<\/p> <p>There will be two additional skills sessions for CKA members, on Sat.

You can still learn the fundamentals of bracing with a rec boat but it's hard to get realistic practice.<\/p> <p>2. A spray skirt that stays on the boat when you edge the boat. You can't learn to brace very well if your spray skirt comes off by itself every time you start to go over or if your boat starts to fill up with water when you edge it.<\/p> <p>Note: if you don't have a good boat for learning these skills, you can rent one from Chuck for just $15 for the two hours.<\/p> <p>3. Warm clothing if you get cold easily. The pool is heated but some people get cold after spending so much time in the water. If you get cold easily it might be wise to wear some type of wet suit, like a farmer john or jane.<\/p> <p>4. A change of clothes. There are lockers and showers available.<\/p> <p>5. It is helpful is you already know how to do a wet exit. But if not, that is the very first thing you'll do at these sessions.<\/p> <p><b>Cost and Payment<\/b><\/p> <p>The cost for these sessions is $45. Here's how that breaks down: $20 for the pool + $5 for insurance + $20 for the lesson. $20 for a 90 minute skills lesson is a great price. Add $15 if you need a rental.<\/p> <p>You must pay when you register. Pay via Pay Pal here.<\/p> <p>Refunds will only be available if there is a waiting list and someone actually takes your spot. However, there will be a $10 administrative fee for any refunds.<\/p> <p>You will be sent a reminder and more detailed information a few days before the class.<\/p> <p><b>Answer the questions<\/b><\/p> <p>In order to register you must also answer three questions:<\/p> <p>1) what's your email address?

These sessions are designed to help you learn to roll or improve your existing roll. They will be taught by ACA certified instructors (Mike Hamilton and Tom Malone) who are expert rollers and very supportive teachers.<\/p> <p>The classes will be held at the Catonsville YMCA on Saturday Jan 23 from 7 - 9 PM.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/3\/600_445724467.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What to Expect<\/b><\/p> <p>The rolling instruction will be for 1 hour 15 minutes. You will then have an additional 45 minutes of pool time to practice what you've learned, or practice other skills, or just chill out.<\/p> <p>The classes are small with just three students for each instructor. This insures that you will get plenty of attention during the session. Enrollment is limited to six people.<\/p> <p>Rolling isn't something that most people learn to do with just one lesson. So it would be best to expect that you won't actually roll. However, you will get the basic mechanics and components of your roll. Then it is a matter of a lot of practice and probably additional instruction. There will be two additional rolling sessions for CKA members, on Sat. Feb. 6 and Sat Mar 5. (You will need to register for those separately if you want to do them.)<\/p> <p>We usually go out to a local bar\/restaurant afterwards.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/d\/b\/7\/600_445724471.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What you need<\/b><\/p> <p>1. a boat that fits you i.e. one that you do not slide all around in and fall out of as soon as you turn upside down, In general, rec boats are not good for learning to roll.<\/p> <p>2.

One reviewer notes, \u201cAlthough this book is immense in its scope, Traleg Kyabgon never allows us to lose sight of the key point and ultimate meaning of all the Buddha\u2019s teachings: that it is possible to get to the root of suffering and to bring about lasting happiness for ourselves and others; and that the only way to do this is to work with, understand, tame, and transform our mind.\u201d<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will read the text aloud and then discuss it. It is not necessary to own or read the book in advance to attend a meeting. But people who plan to attend regularly are encouraged to own a copy of the book. People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to join in and share in the conversation. Visitors and members have access to all sessions on a drop-in basis; no advance registration is required. People can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able.<\/p> <p>Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center, and each meeting will open and close with the recitation of short prayers and mantras from a prayer book. There is no need to own a copy of the prayer book for these Sunday sessions because copies will be available.<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>It is the Gampopa Center\u2019s wish to provide teachings and on a no-charge basis for those wish to explore Buddhism.

Formed in 2005, the brothers quickly expanded on ideas composed the previous year by Casey for his senior thesis in music composition studies at The Ohio State University. After a few live performances, the band was picked up by New York-based Stunning Models On Display Records. With the label\u2019s support, the band finished the recording of their debut album \u201cDecades\u201d in 2006 and celebrated its release later that year with extensive touring throughout North America. Once home, Casey began the near 2-year writing process for their follow-up album \u201cLength of Arms\u201d. The sophomore effort had its soft (digital-only) release in late 2009 on Vital Music Records. The band just released their latest album, \"All Burn\" in the summer of 2015 via Kscope Records (UK) to critical acclaim.\"<\/p> <p>The Teavolve Open Mic happens <b>every Monday evening<\/b> with host rob of the band ilyAIMY. <b>The list goes out at around 6pm-ish and performances kick off at 7 running till 10pm.<\/b> Slots are 2 songs \/ 10 minutes whichever is shortest with a \"PG-13\" environment.

The free flic follows a buffet for $14 served from 6:30 pm. (The food is delicious!)<\/p> <p>The House I Live In has been admired for telling the heart-wrenching stories of many on the front lines of the longstanding U.S. \u201cwar on drugs\u201d -- officers, judges, inmates and their families. Filmed in over twenty states, it captures the breadth of incarceration by the U.S., the world\u2019s largest jailer, and the depth of human rights violations involved. The film won the U.S. documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival.<\/p> <p>Brutal deaths at the hands of police officers have more recently grabbed national attention, but this film reminds us that in carrying on the drug war, courts and corrections systems have long applied policies unjust and unwise. The results: for comparatively mild offenses, mass numbers of people have served hugely disproportionate sentences. Their own and their families\u2019 lives have been disrupted and the public has paid high costs for a war that has failed. The film recognizes drug abuse as a matter of public health and underlines the tragic errors of framing it mainly as a law-enforcement issue. We have seen a beginning of early release and amnesty for certain federal prisoners serving unduly long sentences. Yet the issues of racial injustice, mandatory sentencing, and profits of the \"prison-industrial complex\u201d remain all too timely. Two expert justice reform advocates will offer policy updates and lead discussion. Bob Ross, long active with the NAACP Prince George\u2019s chapter and its president for the past five years, will report on pending reform measures in the Maryland General Assembly. From the federal-policy group The Sentencing Project will come sociologist Nazgol Ghandnoosh, who has studied racial disparities in the justice system and the scope of reform efforts, including projects that challenge severe sentences. The audience will learn how citizens can best raise their voices for justice reform.<\/p> <p>The Reel &amp; Meal monthly series raises awareness about environmental, social and animal rights concerns. The Prince George\u2019s County Peace &amp; Justice Coalition has planned this program; for more information about it contact[masked] [masked]. The other local grassroots sponsors of the series are Beaverdam Creek Watershed Watch Group and Green Vegan Networking.

Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt.

They have a very large selection of beers and good food in a casual open bar area. \u00a0Nothing fancy, but it's relaxed and highly recommended on Yelp.
