region, followed by reds (about 30%), with whites a distant third.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve traveled to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, you\u2019ll know that even those who disdain ros\u00e9 find it hard to resist a glass of cold pink stuff on a sunny seaside terrace.\u00a0 But there\u2019s much to offer the red wine lover here\u2014big, robust wines based on the inky Mourv\u00e8dre grape, and in a distinctive marriage of Bordeaux and Rh\u00f4ne, Cabernet\/Syrah blends.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/e\/f\/600_443613519.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>THE FEATURED APPELLATIONS<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Cassis:<\/i>\u00a0 The term \u201ccassis\u201d is usually associated with the blackcurrant liqueur of the same name (which comes from Burgundy), but it\u2019s also a small seaside appellation east of Marseille, the only one in Provence that is best known for white wines.\u00a0 A combination of small production and high reputation means that little of this wine leaves the region.\u00a0 The whites are full-bodied, herb-scented wines based largely on the Marsanne grape.\u00a0 Our Domaine du Bagnol Cassis was grown on a limestone ridge 200 meters from the sea.<\/p> <p><i>Bellet:<\/i>\u00a0 My one experience with Bellet was at a little hole-in-the-wall wine bar on a narrow street in Vieux Nice.\u00a0 I loved it at first sip\u2014rich, inky dark, spicy, and with an indefinable <i>go\u00fbt du terroir<\/i>.\u00a0 It really seemed to express the countryside it came from.\u00a0 But good luck finding a bottle of it.\u00a0 This is the local wine of Nice, made in tiny quantities from the obscure Folle Noire grape.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost unheard-of to see this wine outside of Nice, let alone outside of France, so I was astonished to find a wine merchant in Manhattan selling it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have a bottle of it, and I hope it re-creates that first experience in Vieux Nice.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Palette:<\/i>\u00a0 Here\u2019s another (you guessed it) tiny appellation, wedged between the more generic appellations of C\u00f4tes de Provence and C\u00f4teaux d\u2019Aix-en-Provence.\u00a0 What sets Palette apart is that it\u2019s situated on a limestone ridge, seen most conspicuously on the nearby gleaming-white Mont St-Victoire.\u00a0 The wines come in all three colors, the robust, ageworthy reds based on the traditional southern blend of Grenache\/Syrah\/Mourv\u00e8dre\/Carignan.\u00a0 One maker dominates this appellation, the renowned Ch\u00e2teau Simone.\u00a0 Its fame comes at a price\u2014even the ros\u00e9s are $50 and up.\u00a0 But I found a bargain-priced Palette red that I hope will be just as good.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Bandol:<\/i>\u00a0 If you think of serious Proven\u00e7al wine, you think of Bandol.\u00a0 It\u2019s a seaside appellation between Marseille and Toulon, situated on a coastal mountain range that provides a very warm, sheltered growing environment.\u00a0 Conditions here are perfect for Mourv\u00e8dre, a spicy, smoky red varietal that is difficult to fully ripen elsewhere.\u00a0 Mourv\u00e8dre must make up at least 50 percent of the blend, ensuring that red Bandols will exhibit the appellation\u2019s trademark lushness and intensity.\u00a0 The pink versions are among the more serious Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9s.\u00a0 Domaine Tempier is the big name here, and commands correspondingly big prices, but our Domaine de Terrebrune is also highly respected.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4tes de Provence:<\/i>\u00a0 This is the big catch-all appellation, accounting for the vast majority of Proven\u00e7al wine production, the vast majority of which is ros\u00e9, largely based on the traditional southern formula of Grenache\/Syrah\/Mourv\u00e8dre.\u00a0 Terroir varies greatly within the region, as does wine quality.\u00a0 Although I\u2019ve sensed that my group members strongly favor red wines over white (or ros\u00e9), I felt I wouldn\u2019t be properly representing this part of France without including a C\u00f4tes de Provence ros\u00e9.\u00a0 After some deliberation, I\u2019ve chosen the 2014 Miraval.\u00a0 I hesitated\u2014this wine is very popular, highly publicized, and is surrounded by a certain celebrity personality cult.\u00a0 The vineyard is part owned by Brad and Angelina, and the back label says <i>Mis en bouteille par Jolie-Pitt <\/i>(I can just see them personally manning the bottling line).\u00a0 All of this turned me off a bit.\u00a0 But the winemaker is from famed Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape producer Beaucastel, and the wine gets very respectful reviews (even from that notorious curmudgeon Jancis Robinson).\u00a0 So let\u2019s give it a try.\u00a0 The bottle is undeniably pretty.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/f\/a\/600_443613530.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There\u2019s also a red C\u00f4tes de Provence in the lineup, featuring the little-known, very local Tibouren grape.\u00a0 Clos Cibonne is a devoted advocate of this fast-disappearing grape, which produces a fresh, light-bodied red with scents of herbal <i>garrigue<\/i>.\u00a0 Cibonne even obtained special permission to prominently feature the grape name on the label, very unusual for a French AOC wine.\u00a0 The grape is thought to be identical to the Rosesse grape of Liguria, but Cibonne\u2019s winemaker denied this\u2014because he\u2019s never heard of Liguria.<\/p> <p><i>C\u00f4teaux d\u2019Aix-en-Provence:<\/i>\u00a0 This is the second big catch-all appellation, mainly to the north and west of the city of Aix.\u00a0 Production is dominated by ros\u00e9.\u00a0 Again, terroirs and quality vary widely, the best wines coming from vineyards on the limestone ridge.\u00a0 Les Baux de Provence constitutes a western extension of the region, best known for high-quality reds.\u00a0 The wine we are having from this region is one of the stars of Provence, Domaine de Tr\u00e9vallon, famous for its Cabernet\/Syrah blend.\u00a0 But because the Cabernet content exceeds the allowed 20 percent, the appellation on the label is a mere IGP Alpilles.\u00a0 This is the Proven\u00e7al equivalent of a Supertuscan.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Good French wines call for good French food, so we\u2019ll be returning to Left Bank in the West Village, the site of this group\u2019s inaugural event.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/leftbanknewyork.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/leftbanknewyork.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/leftbanknewyork.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>More on the

Cassis\u00a0 $22\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Guide Hachette des Vins 2014<\/i> \u2605 \u2013 Si le domaine est implant\u00e9 en plein c\u0153ur du village de Cassis, les vignes en revanche s'assoient au pied du cap Canaille. Un assemblage de marsanne (63\u00a0%) et de clairette (24\u00a0%) compl\u00e9t\u00e9 d'ugni blanc est \u00e0 l'origine de cette cuv\u00e9e tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussie, jaune aux reflets verts. Fruits frais (prune, mirabelle et melon d'eau), fleurs (glycine) et notes menthol\u00e9es se marient avec bonheur pour composer un ensemble suave et \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Un vin \u00e9l\u00e9gant et onctueux que l'on verrait bien accompagner une soupe de poisson de roche.\u00a0 (Although the domaine is located in the heart of the village of Cassis, the vineyards sit at the foot of Cap Canaille. A blend of Marsanne [63%] and Clairette [24%], plus Ugni Blanc, is the product of this very successful vintage, yellow with green highlights. Fresh fruit [plum, mirabelle, and watermelon], flowers [glycine] and menthol happily blend to compose a suave and balanced package. An elegant and smooth wine that would nicely accompany a soup of rockfish.)<\/p> <p><b>2014 Miraval C\u00f4tes de Provence Ros\u00e9\u00a0 $21\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 The finest ros\u00e9 yet from this estate (the wine is made by the top notch team at Ch\u00e2teau Beaucastel), the light pink colored 2014 C\u00f4tes de Provence Ros\u00e9 sports a fresh and lively bouquet of wild strawberries, raspberries and white flowers to go with a supple, lightly textured, silky and seamless feel on the palate. About as gulpable and hard to resist as they come, it's a killer ros\u00e9 to drink over the coming 6-8 months.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16+\/20<\/i> \u2013 Very pale pink. Light, refreshing, focused nose with some smoky notes. Good, pretty fruit on the mid palate. Pretty modern with freshness uppermost but it shouldn\u2019t fall apart too soon, even if it may never be exceptionally subtle.\u00a0 Cinsault, Grenache, Syrah, Rolle.<\/p> <p><b>2010 Clos St-Vincent Le Clos Bellet\u00a0 $30\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Le Guide Bettane et Desseauve des Vins de France[masked]\/20 <\/i>\u2013 Vin puissant, volumineux en bouche, la mati\u00e8re est \u00e9norme, il capitalise les qualit\u00e9s de ce grand mill\u00e9sime ici.\u00a0 Comme souvent au domaine, un peu de patience r\u00e9compensera ceux qui l\u2019auront attendu.\u00a0 (Powerful wine, voluminous in the mouth, the body is huge, it capitalizes on the qualities of the great vintage here.

Aged 24 months in primarily <i>foudre<\/i> (5% in barrel), it sports an inky, opaque color as well as a deep, raw bouquet of cassis, liquid herbs, olive tapenade, blood, and serious minerality that continues to change and evolve over the evening. Medium to full-bodied and surprisingly elegant and pure on the palate, it possesses perfect balance, fine tannin and lively acidity that shines on the finish. Gorgeous all around, yet still a baby, it needs another year or three of bottle age and will evolve gracefully for 12-15+ years.

It was good to see everyone, i like that alot of people met each other. Were doing this again this sunday but back to the 8pm show, the club wasnt too happy that there were so many of us in the bar for so long and it makes sense. I dont have the lineup yet but i will update it as i get it tomorrow. See you then! Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us.<\/p> <p>This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups.

I dont have the lineup yet but i will update it as i get it tomorrow. See you then! Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us.<\/p> <p>This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups.

We have had far too many no-shows.<\/p> <p>You will see progress in your writing project by spending the minimum of a single hour per week on it. This is your practice\/focus time, so I hope to see you there.<\/p> <p>Join other writers for an hour of focused writing!<\/p> <p>7-8 pm - Show up early, stake out a spot and either socialize or get a jump on writing.<br\/>8:00 - Start. Introductions, and we'll share what we're working on<br\/>8:05 - Get down to business. An hour of silence and solid writing!<br\/>9:05- Brief follow up. People are encouraged to share experiences &amp; ideas, network or take off as they like. Feel free to keep writing if you've got the momentum going! Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing. It may just be \"pipe-cleaning\" for now, but you'll feel better showing up at the page. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice.<\/p> <p>WHERE: Argo Tea Cafe, Columbus Circle Subway Station. 1792 Broadway.<\/p> <p>SOME TIPS:<\/p> <p>Argo has plenty of outlets - we will be on the back, large table.<br\/>Seats are hard to come by, and I can only save so many, so please, come on time! If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP! Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/225359026\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflytpblb","time":1447030800000,"updated":1447043170000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

People are no longer tethered to one location and the 9 to 5 routine is gone. Where you work impacts productivity, creativity, and, ultimately, your ability to thrive. Dynamic workspaces are now seen as a catalyst to success. This comes as a result of a shift in mind-set with flexible workspaces recognized as a way of fostering better communication, performance and retention through design. Shared space providers continue to innovate as the workspace becomes a strategic tool for modern businesses.<\/p> <p>During this session led by SPACES\u2019 Senior Director, Simon Moore, panelists will examine how the changing nature of work and the evolving expectations and needs of today\u2019s workers are pushing workspace formats to new heights. Fluid design, collaborative environments, community engagement and maximum flexibility are disrupting the status quo and are fueling a new way to work that is being embraced by businesses across the board.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/1\/0\/600_443611248.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Simon Moore -\u00a0<\/b><b>Senior Director, Strategic Initiatives of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spacesworks.com\/\">Spaces<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Simon Moore is a key contributor to the workplace revolution.

Examples would be something that measures (or even predicts) macro indicators like inflation, gdp, unemployment and manufacturing.<\/p> <p>2) Parse sentiment in financial news\/social media text and\/or video and image content on the web using Bluemix to create a sentiment based indicator that can measure and\/or predict market direction.<\/p> <p>3) Analyze huge volumes of sec.gov data to perform real time fundamental analysis on companies using public filings using Watson. Insight should be useful in identifying undervalued stocks or short sale candidates. An offshoot project may involve scanning regulatory filings in real time and cross referencing options markets to create an indicator that could flag potential insider trading activity.<\/p> <p>4) Use Bluemix to create a polling tool that can be used to gather consensus opinion from alpha modus users about various topics like stock market direction, a stock's price or even a political election, a sporting event or new product release. Apply creativity in determining topics to poll. Then create an interactive real time visualization to display results of the poll.<\/p> <p>Suggested Bluemix APIs to Use:<br\/>Alchemy API<br\/>Concept Expansion and Insight<br\/>Language Translation<br\/>Personality Insights<br\/>Trade Off Analysis<br\/>DataWorks<br\/>Insights for Twitter<br\/>Predictive Analytics<br\/>Stream Analytics<br\/>Data Cache<br\/>Session cache<br\/>GeoCoding<\/p> <p>Write your app in Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go or bring your own runtime.

Looking to take your dreams to the next level and build a business you can be proud of? This November in New York City, The Phat Startup and the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University brings together a diverse range of industry leaders, and startup founders all influenced by Hip Hop to educate the community on Entrepreneurship.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tech 808 will explore the world of entrepreneurship through the lens of people actually in the trenches making it happen. Not a billionaire that has others building their dreams. Each talk will leave YOU inspired but also ready to take it to the next level with executable actionable advice!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Wait no Jay Z or P Diddy? We believe real learning takes place when you learn from people building out their dreams , not the person that has built an empire. We can learn from someone like Jay Z but the tactics people in the trenches are using RIGHT NOW, can make a big difference in your company. They won\u2019t be selling you their dreams, they will be there educating you on how you can go from dream chasers to businessmen and women.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blacksintech\/events\/225703270\/","yes_rsvp_count":38,"duration":25200000,"name":"Tech808: Hip Hop-Inspired Tech Entrepreneurship Conference","id":"225703270","time":1447077600000,"updated":1447106162000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1235943485000,"name":"Blacks In Technology (BIT)","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1396466,"urlname":"blacksintech","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"BIT Thought Leaders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"125 West 18th Street","name":"Metropolitan Pavilion","lon":-73.99601,"id":24198004,"state":"NY","lat":40.740616,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.722192287445,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447011823000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/2\/5\/600_443968965.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/pulse.coinvent.co\/\">CoInvent Pulse<\/a> is a business &amp; technology festival that takes place in NYC tomorrow, Nov 9th, 2015.

And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are.

It is based on the belief that we have two thoughts systems, one based on fear and separation from the Divine and another one based on love and oneness with the Divine. The Course is designed to help us become increasingly aware of the LOVE that is already present within us to let go all of the fearful thoughts and beliefs that we hold.

Just don't get lost biking to Brooklyn. \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc4\ud83d\udeb4\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udeb6\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfc7\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>SPEAKERS<\/b><br\/><b>Brian Riordan<\/b>\u00a0[@<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/riordabr\">riordabr<\/a>] is the Manager of <a href=\"http:\/\/metro.strava.com\/\">Strava Metro<\/a> at Strava, Inc.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

A lot of LI LaunchPad members with their great ideas should be there too. So its a great place to see who's who if you're looking for a job, or a consulting opportunity, or a great product that you need for your business. Or to just see what's cooking on Long Island.<\/p> <p>I'll have a table there with a two-fold agenda. One to promote my product consulting services, the other to promote my DigiTel Call-In Dictation System and to fish for sales reps. \u00a0There are lots of opportunities for sales reps, as the users of my system come from $100 million dollar businesses... law firms, police departments, insurance companies, universities, hospitals, and businesses of all types and sizes.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year this event was held in the lobby of the Cradle of Aviation Museum (one of my favorite places).<\/p> <p>This year the exhibitor list has grown, and so its across the street from that museum at the Mitchell Field Athletic Complex, 1 Charles Lindberg Blvd., Uniondale.<\/p> <p>See www.LITechDay.com where you can register for a FREE visitor pass. They welcome all attendees, including job hunters. There is still time to register for a table too... they are $199 which is a bargain given the foot traffic and opportunities to meet people and companies.<\/p> <p>The local press and News 12 should be there too, so if you have something to show and rent a table, you have a good chance for some free publicity. At the previous event, I was given an opportunity to present myself, company and products and job opportunities on Scott Passeser's Job Line radio show the following week, live... that was a kick!<\/p> <p>For the members of our group, I think this is a must-see event. For those of us from Suffolk, yes, its a 40 minute drive to Nassau, but its against traffic so its a breeze to get to.<\/p> <p>You probably need just an hour or so to do a walk through to see which exhibitors you want to spend time with. Please come see me too!<\/p> <p>Even though this is a field trip meetup, if you think you're coming please RSVP here too so I know I can expect some friendly faces to say hi.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be at my table, but I won't know where until about 1 pm.

Directed by F.W. Murnau, the film is one of the most important products of German cinematography during the Weimar Republic. Bram Stoker\u2019s heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered that all copies of the film be destroyed. However, a few copies of Nosferatu survived in various cuts. After being digitally restored in 2006, the film is now available on DVD and Blue-Ray. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><b>The Piano Performance - Markus Horn<\/b><\/p> <p>When listening to Markus Horn\u2019s new score to the movie in concert, it is more than just a piano playing along to a movie. The combination of the various musical styles turns the soundtrack into its own fascinating piece of art. Horn takes a fresh approach to silent film accompaniment on piano, by adding jazz rhythms, pop chords and abstract improvisations. Having received standing ovations all around the world for his composition to Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis, Markus Horn now presents his soundtrack to another German silent movie \u2013 Nosferatu.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It takes up to six months for the performer and the new score to be ready for the stage. Compositions, themes and motifs are developed and continue to evolve along with the storyline of the movie. The musician needs to become so familiar with the scenes of the movie that he plays and breathes synchronically, in order to create a powerful and lyrical accompaniment to F.W. Murnau\u2019s expressionist cinematic masterpiece.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe event is made possible with the generous support of Kino Lorber Films. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Admission<\/b><\/p> <p>Admission is free for this event, but your registration\u00a0at <a href=\"https:\/\/nosferatuhorn.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nosferatuhorn.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/nosferatuhorn.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a> is required to gain access.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>How do I get there by subway?<\/b><\/p> <p>6: 51st St<\/p> <p>4\/5\/6\/7: Grand Central Terminal<\/p> <p>E\/M: Lexington Av\/53rd St<\/p> <p><i>Since the event is near 1st Ave &amp; 49th St, there is going to be a bit of a walk involved, keep that in mind for your timing &amp; check google maps for details.<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p>\n\n\nI hope to see you there, please don't forget to register at Eventbrite (see link atop) for guaranteed access.

This meetup will consist of several lightning talks that will be around 20 minutes each. Here's a look at the agenda...<\/p> <p><b>Marc Sewtz<\/b> \u00a0- <b>Oracle Open World Recap<\/b>:\u00a0Couldn\u2019t make it to Oracle Open World this year? Marc will give you a brief recap of the highlights, learn about what\u2019s new with Oracle Application Express and related technologies.<\/p> <p><b>Patrick Maniraho<\/b> -\u00a0<b>Android Apps Consuming APEX Web Services<\/b>:\u00a0RESTful web services are application programming interfaces (API) that can be accessed through the HTTP protocol. Oracle APEX RESTful web services allow us to expose data to other systems as JSON feeds. In this demo, we will see how we can leverage these tools to create and consume web services to mobile ecosystem (an Android app that consumes the APEX web services). \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Dan McGhan<\/b> - <b>How We Implemented \"Extended Session\" in apex.world<\/b>: \u00a0Hopefully you've all heard of the new community site for APEX, &lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/apex.world,&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/apex.world,&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>; by now. \u00a0One little feature of that site that I helped implement was the \"extended session\" or permanent login that users can optionally enable. This prevents them from having to enter their credentials when they return to the site in the future. In this session I'll provide an overview of how this was achieved!<\/p> <p>Also, we'll be giving away a free copy of the recently released book: Expert Oracle Application Express, 2nd Edition. Hope to see you there! :)<\/p> <p><b>Note: You must RSVP for this event and seats are limited. Please RSVP with your full name and bring matching ID for security.

(There's also\u00a0a full range of appetizers, soups and salads, flatbread pizza, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, etc.)<\/p> <p>It's sure to be a great evening and a \"howling\" good time at Wicked Wolf! Hope to see the \"regulars\" again this month and also encourage newcomers to attend - we are a friendly, fun, and interesting group!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/8\/e\/600_291941102.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(Wicked Wolf is within easy walking distance from the Path; if driving, street and garage parking is available.)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Once-a-Month-Group-40\/events\/226527074\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Let's Celebrate Two Years at Wicked Wolf!","id":"226527074","time":1447197300000,"updated":1447209527000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1247252488000,"name":"Hoboken Once a Month Group- 40 +","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1487339,"urlname":"Hoboken-Once-a-Month-Group-40","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Ridgewood","address_1":"112 Oak St.","name":"YMCA","lon":-74.117538,"id":20621932,"state":"NJ","lat":40.983246,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.4746952057,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1402511696000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Start Time:(6:15pm to 7:15pm)<\/b>:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Yoga lead by Kula for Karma Instructor, Jackie Owen (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>)<\/p> <p>All levels\u00a0<\/p> <p>Addresses: Ridgewood, NJ YMCA, 112 Oak St, Ridgewood, NJ 07450 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kulaforkarma.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kulaforkarma.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.kulaforkarma.org\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>POC: Caroline Angel <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Team-Red-White-and-Blue-Central-NJ\/events\/225490312\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Yoga  at Ridgewood YMCA by  Kula for Karma","id":"dtqdtjytpbnb","time":1447197300000,"updated":1447214733000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402366475000,"name":"Team Red, White, and Blue NJ (Central and Northern Chapters)","group_lon":-74.3499984741,"id":14990722,"urlname":"Team-Red-White-and-Blue-Central-NJ","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Team Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Carle Place","address_1":"165 Old Country Rd","name":"Panera Bread","lon":-73.615768,"id":20013132,"lat":40.743511,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":19.6344127655,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432726213000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are planning to sit, chat and have fun while improving our American Sign Language skills. \u00a0We are at a great location right off of the Meadowbrook Parkway at Panera Bread. \u00a0So if you are coming from work, you can grab a bite to eat and relax too!

You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/226546119\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytpbnb","time":1447198200000,"updated":1447225562000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"230 Thompson St","name":"The Uncommons","lon":-73.998795,"id":23946176,"lat":40.729465,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":1.49474644661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446855029000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Well known fact: We are all kids at heart!<\/p> <p><br\/>Come join us at Manhattan\u2019s only Board Game Cafe!

Josh Hatton, the ambassador for Kilchoman, will be visiting Caledonia this coming Tuesday for a complimentary tasting! \u00a0Kilchoman is an Islay scotch, it's actually one of the most western distilleries in all of Scotland. \u00a0They are pretty unique in that they grow the barley, malt, distill, mature, and bottle all on the Islay. \u00a0This is a relatively new distillery, opening in 2005, but they are putting out some top notch scotch. \u00a0I feel I need to add in a disclaimer for those unfamiliar with Islay scotches. These scotches are peated, some heavily so! \u00a0So just be aware that these aren't going to be the bourbon\/sherry bombs that the Glenfiddich tasting was. \u00a0These big boys will have a heavy dose of smoke. \u00a0So come check it out if you enjoy the peat or just want to see what the deal is with peated scotches!<\/p> <p>The Logistics: \u00a0The tasting is at 8pm at Caledonia. \u00a0I will get there likely really early because I now work nearby! \u00a0This bar is small so I'm putting a limit on the group.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

The failure of scientists and philosophers to reach a consensus explanation of consciousness has led to a revival of interest in theories once widely dismissed, such as panpsychism. Robert Wright, Visiting Professor of Science and Religion at Union Theological Seminary, explores the mind-body problem with renowned philosopher David Chalmers and the MacArthur-Award-winning novelist and philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/the-weirdness-of-consciousness-tickets-19101565296\">RSVP here!<\/a><\/p> <p>DAVID CHALMERS is Professor of Philosophy and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness at New York University.

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established.

Over $5.3 billion of private capital was invested in this sector between 2012 and 2014, increasing by 30% - 50% year over year. While the food industry grows and weathers a challenged economy, individual companies battle for share of stomach has increased, the fight to obtain adequate funding has intensified, and dealing with an escalating pace of change has become an essential success attribute.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Divisions between retail and convenience, commercial and non-commercial are drying up. Funding sources, payment methods, marketing strategies and consumer demand evolve as technology changes, players shift focus and customers become savvier. Join us at the Business of Food, where thought leaders will discuss ideas, market perspectives and financing options from many sides of the food spectrum.

Wouldn\u2019t it be great to preserve the experience and data model also when you run complex analytic queries and Big Data workloads? When using RDBMSs, people who need analytics often couple a warehouse such as Netezza, Vertica or Teradata with their RDBMS OLTP database. In the NoSQL world the equivalent is SonarW. SonarW is a Big Data warehouse that looks and feels like MongoDB \u2013 it is 100% mongo-compliant, stores JSON, and has the same simplicity and elegance of MongoDB \u2013 but inside it is a column-store, it can run a single query using many threads, it indexes all fields (even thousands) using big data indexes that won\u2019t blow up memory, and more. The result is that you can store many TBs of JSON data on a single commodity node and run aggregation queries that complete in seconds. In this Meetup we delve into how SonarW works, what it does well (and what not so well) and how to use it in-tandem with MongoDB to provide fast analytics on JSON data.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Ron Bennatan worked with RDBMSs and Hadoop for 20 years before seeing the light and moving to work with NoSQL and MongoDB. He is a co-founder of jSonar and the principal author of JSON Studio. Before that he was the CTO for Big Data Governance at IBM. He authored 10 technical books on topics such as databases, WebSphere and CORBA.<\/p> <p><b>Talk 2: What's New in MongoDB 3.2<\/b><\/p> <p>New generations of database technologies are allowing organizations to build applications never before possible, at a speed and scale that were previously unimaginable. MongoDB is the fastest growing database on the planet, and the new 3.2 release will bring the benefits of modern database architectures to an ever broader range of applications and users.<\/p> <p>Speaker:\u00a0Rhea\u00a0Moss, MongoDB product management<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-MongoDB-User-Group\/events\/225945267\/","yes_rsvp_count":177,"name":"Big Data Warehousing for MongoDB \/ JSON data & What's New in 3.2","id":"225945267","time":1447282800000,"updated":1447339089000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1271084266000,"name":"New York MongoDB User Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1629296,"urlname":"New-York-MongoDB-User-Group","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"266 West 37th Street, 9th Floor (Entrance at 520 8th Avenue - use the security desk to the left)","name":"Center for Arts Education","lon":-73.991127,"id":21485912,"state":"NY","lat":40.753639,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.258654683828,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445407272000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tickets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Come join us for an evening of reflection, inspiration and refreshments.<\/p> <p>We are going to be diving into the daily practice and discussing<\/p> <p><b>how to create the perfect daily routine for you!<\/b><\/p> <p>6:00pm - 6:15pm Check In<\/p> <p>6:15pm - 6:30 pm Welcome<\/p> <p>6:30pm - 7:00pm Chris Winfield + Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>7:00pm - 7:30pm Daily Routine Activity<\/p> <p>7:30pm - 8:00 pm Closing\/ Mingle<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTickets:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/creating-the-perfect-daily-routine-tickets-19181798275<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Choose-Yourself-NYC\/events\/226204294\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Creating the Perfect Daily Routine","id":"226204294","time":1447282800000,"updated":1447292034000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421953458000,"name":"Choose Yourself NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18367616,"urlname":"Choose-Yourself-NYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Choose Yourselfers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441733263000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a permanent placeholder for\u00a0<b>Dev4X General Update Video Hangout.<\/b><\/p> <p>The meeting will take place <b>Bi-Weekly<\/b>.

Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.
