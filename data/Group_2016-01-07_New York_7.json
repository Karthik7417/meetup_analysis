We are primarily seasoned veterans but welcome young go-getters. <br> <br> We are similar to many other groups in that we are a roundtable forum and everyone gets to give their :60 second pitch. But then we go deeper into your business in our \"advisory\" round where we dive into your business issues and act as your own personal advisory board. <br> <br> We can help you: <br> - develop a sales plan <br> - develop a marketing plan <br> - with finances <br> - with HR issues <br> - secure speaking engagements <br> - become aware of other marketing and sales opportunities, trade shows and advertising mediums <br> - meet other key people and partners <br> - get more referrals! <br> <br> Call Raphi Salem (917-862-8929) today to find out more or to RSVP for any of our monthly events. <br> <br> Most events take place on Thursday mornings (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Thursday of every month) at 8-9:30AM. Then there is more networking after the meeting until 10AM. Once in a while we will gather for happy hour at a local bar, tavern, restaurant or lounge. <br> <br> Cost: Annual Membership is $500. This entitles you to attend all meetings without having to pay the $20 per meeting fee. (Payment must be made in advance via paypal here: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fDv0KA\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fDv0KA<\/a>) or to payments {at} salemglobal.com or $25\/cash at the door.) <br> <\/p>\n<p>Sponsors: We are always looking for sponsors.

opportunity for young musicians and composers to present their efforts to the public.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Curated by NY-based conductor\/composer Peter Breiner and based on the same concept as his house concerts, this series will be the result of the many encounters Breiner has had with local musicians, both professionally and personally.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You would be hard-pressed to find greater evidence of NYC being a melting pot and a cultural\/musical Mecca of the world. So far these concerts, consisting of a random collection of musicians, have always presented an incredibly high level of musicianship and artistry. The connections made at these events have serendipitously led to further collaborations and opportunities.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Starting in January 2014, a beautiful space at Bohemian National Hall will be filled with music that is both contemporary and looking toward the future, trying to incorporate all the latest developments in technology while at the same time firmly rooted in musical traditions and connected to Czech musical culture. As an example, one of the concerts will present a Piano Trio by Bedrich Smetana and also a Cello Sonata by 22-year-old composer Kristina Smetana.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Connections like this one will be at the heart of the dramaturgy of the series while at the same time putting out a call for new pieces and musicians and try to fit them into the random flow of events called life. Concerts of the series will take place (with a few exceptions) on the last Friday of each month for as long as the serendipity continues to work.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As a part of the evening, we will also have talks and discussions\u2014perhaps even panels\u2014about the future of classical music, with some prominent and very interesting speakers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We are not setting any age limits, but we want to gear the series towards young composers and musicians (young at heart could also qualify).<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7761104,"name":"Peter Breiner","photo":{"photo_id":167441742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/0\/e\/member_167441742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/0\/e\/thumb_167441742.jpeg"}},"members":85,"name":"New York's Sounds of Serendipity","id":11747372,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-Yorks-Sounds-of-Serendipity","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Classical players and listeners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1388809208000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"fashion-and-style","name":"Fashion and Style","id":16575},{"urlkey":"internet-of-things","name":"Internet of Things","id":79740},{"urlkey":"wearable-technologies","name":"Wearable Technologies","id":454182}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/wearables\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Wwed Bk<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":124495252,"name":"Paul Farkas","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/2\/c\/highres_215228492.jpeg","photo_id":215228492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/2\/c\/member_215228492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/2\/c\/thumb_215228492.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"Wearable Wednesday Brooklyn","id":11755012,"state":"NY","urlname":"wearables","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.75,"who":"WwedBk"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Chatham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1388854528000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"event-planning-fundraising","name":"Event Planning & Fundraising","id":77233}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OHA-Twig-15\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Please note, OHA Twig #15\u00a0is a private group with membership dues and is only open to those living in the Highlands section of Chatham Twp.<\/p>\n<p>OHA Twig #15 is a community group that supports the Overlook Hospital Auxiliary.

There's something for everyone at NHOC. Aside from hiking, the club is involved with many activities including camping, walking, horseback riding, bicycling, picnicking, and just about anything which broadens knowledge of and respect for nature. Some members participate in trail maintenance and other conservation efforts. During the winter months, indoor as well as outdoor activities are offered. All hikes and activities are graded on their level of difficulty - from easy (\"C\") to challenging (\"A\"). We are a friendly, social group looking for new members. \u00a0Many of our members fall into the SINGLES category and there is no better way to find new friends than by participating in an activity that you love. If you decide to become a full paying member of NHOC, you will receive our Shorelines publication several times throughout the year, informing you of all of our activities. We organize 15-30 hikes per month throughout the New York area. Parties, social gatherings, city walks, movie nights, bowling, and weekend trips are only some of the wide range of activities that we plan for our members. Annual dues is only $30 (Individual) or $40 (Family).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>As a Meetup member, you may join us for 2 hikes before becoming a full paying member of NHOC.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Here is link to our membership form:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nassauhiking.org\/NHOCMembership_form_2014.pdf\">http:\/\/www.nassauhiking.org\/NHOCMembership_form_2014.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more information, here is a link to our website:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nassauhiking.org\">http:\/\/www.nassauhiking.org<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-73.6900024414,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":95948312,"name":"Jill K","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/highres_169588202.jpeg","photo_id":169588202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/member_169588202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_169588202.jpeg"}},"members":573,"name":"Nassau Hiking and Outdoor Club (NHOC)","id":12049682,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nassau-Hiking-and-Outdoor-Club-NHOC","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Hikers, walkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1389548487000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"vegan","name":"Vegan","id":408},{"urlkey":"rawfood","name":"Raw Food","id":1983},{"urlkey":"raw-whole-food-demos","name":"Raw Whole Food Demo's","id":19084},{"urlkey":"plant-based-nutrition","name":"Plant-Based Nutrition","id":19490},{"urlkey":"raw-food-diet","name":"Raw Food Diet","id":19987},{"urlkey":"80-10-10","name":"80-10-10","id":23880},{"urlkey":"gluten-free","name":"Gluten-Free","id":24157},{"urlkey":"raw-vegan","name":"Raw Vegan","id":24509},{"urlkey":"raw-potlucks","name":"Raw Potlucks","id":28231},{"urlkey":"raw-food-preparation","name":"Raw Food Preparation","id":29659},{"urlkey":"raw-food-potlucks","name":"Raw Food Potlucks","id":34749},{"urlkey":"raw-food-prep-classes","name":"Raw Food Prep Classes","id":37954},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"low-fat-raw-vegan","name":"Low Fat Raw Vegan","id":146831}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Raw-and-Vegan-Food-Potlucks-and-Events\/","rating":4.8,"description":"<p>This is a group to bring like-minded people together.&nbsp; We are a plant-based (vegan) group focused on maintaining a Raw, Crude and Juicy lifestyle.&nbsp; Crude refers to vegan unprocessed and unrefined, raw is uncooked, and juicy...well I think you get the point ;) <br> <\/p>\n<p>We will have different events to welcome all the Raw, Crude and Juicy crowd.&nbsp; Whether you're vegan, raw, raw-curious, a juicing connoisseur, or if you are interested in taking your health and wellness to the next level - this group is for you!

So for example, we may say, \"This week we'll build the map screen for a simple mapping application that supports push-pins, on iOS\". \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We'll then break the group into teams of 2, attempting to balance out our experience and talent levels as well as possible. \u00a0 After that point, we'll all go away and dive into the code. \u00a0Each group of two will work on the project for the duration of the sprint. We'll create an environment of open collaboration by way of an online project management tool. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>The following meetup will then serve as a code review where we will conduct the following exercises as a group:\u00a0<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>1) Compare architectural decisions and defend reasons for making those decisions<\/p>\n<p>2) Discuss extensions and other third-party components used to aid development<\/p>\n<p>3) Discuss your greatest pain points, or where you flat out hit a brick wall<\/p>\n<p>4) Attempt to gain consensus on the best methods of accomplishing each of the tasks, and compile those methods into a best-practices reference<\/p>\n<p>5) Merge our best code into a common area, and promote that version as group-certified (it's probably very ambitious to try to accomplish this during an actual Meetup)<\/p>\n<p>Then we'll define the next project, and re-start the development cycle. \u00a0We can either completely start over with an altogether different project, or build new components onto the existing one, gradually working our way towards an enterprise-worthy app. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>One great thing about these short development sprints is that we can always bring on new developers at any one of our Meetups.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74.4100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/highres_368948232.jpeg","photo_id":368948232,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/600_368948232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/2\/8\/thumb_368948232.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":135765842,"name":"Todd Nakamura","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/e\/highres_205302382.jpeg","photo_id":205302382,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/e\/member_205302382.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/e\/thumb_205302382.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"NJ Mobile .NET Developers","id":13160752,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJ-Mobile-Dotnet-Developers","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Xamarians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Stamford","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1393975166000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"ruby-on-rails","name":"Ruby On Rails","id":20837},{"urlkey":"objective-c","name":"Objective C","id":21477},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"girlsintech","name":"Girls in Tech","id":65944},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"women-software-developers","name":"Women Software Developers","id":149654},{"urlkey":"ui-ux-design","name":"UI\/UX design","id":917292},{"urlkey":"women-who-code","name":"Women Who Code","id":1398192},{"urlkey":"wwc","name":"wwc","id":1489532}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Women-Who-Code-Connecticut\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p>Mission:<\/p>\n<p>Women Who Code is a global nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers by creating a global, connected community of women in technology.

Misfits of all kinds. It's called unusual because it refers to a special kind of misfit, where you are not necessarily a misfit in all aspects of your life, but one or more of them and you feel really unusual, awkward or inexplicable about why you were not able to fit in. For example, it could be at work, in your family, or in your dating life with same\/opposite sex, or your surrounding society. These are the people who are waiting to fit into those areas that they always had trouble fitting in, but wanted to fit in. I understand that the name 'misfits' is used in television\/movie titles, but I have never watched any of them.

The premise is simple: Surround everyone with positive reinforcements. Strategies and techniques are in place for people to think more positively, significantly reduce daily stress, and build self-esteem - from the very young to the very old. Programs and tools for individuals, schools, businesses, organizations, the City of New York agencies, institutions, etc. are now in place. The vehicles for doing this involve media projects, the internet, the arts and community programs.

Through the group process, you will learn to give yourself permission to express yourself fully in all aspects of your Self, to recognize the good and the healthy, while unraveling the strategies and contexts that keep you stuck. We will partner to uncover that which has been shunned or pushed to the dark and forgotten--those destructive behaviors and unfulfilling relationships that limit your emotional growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My way of being and working with you is warm, respectful, authentic, honest and compassionate. As a group facilitator, my role is to facilitate and move the conversation forward, while attending to the group process and your present moment awareness. The power of group lies in the unique opportunity to receive multiple perspectives, support, encouragement and feedback from other individuals in safe and confidential environment. These interpersonal interactions can provide group members an opportunity to deepen their level of self-awareness and to learn how they relate to others. The Relationship Circle can be a safe and supportive place to experiment with new ideas and ways of being.

Our Death Cafes are always offered: - On a not for profit basis - In an accessible, respectful and confidential space - With no intention of leading people to any conclusion, product or course of action - Alongside refreshing drinks and nourishing food \u2013 and cake!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/a\/highres_350584202.jpeg","photo_id":350584202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/a\/600_350584202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/a\/thumb_350584202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10323389,"name":"Nick","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/5\/0\/highres_185290832.jpeg","photo_id":185290832,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/5\/0\/member_185290832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/5\/0\/thumb_185290832.jpeg"}},"members":101,"name":"Death Cafe Manhattan","id":13631992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Death-Cafe-Manhattan","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1396213863000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"taichi","name":"Tai Chi","id":2543},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"qigong","name":"Qi Gong","id":9857},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"guided-meditation","name":"Guided Meditation","id":21628},{"urlkey":"internal-martial-arts","name":"Internal Martial Arts","id":28022},{"urlkey":"tai-chi-for-health-longevity","name":"Tai Chi for Health & Longevity","id":31532},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"qigong-exercise","name":"Qigong Exercise","id":85547}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TaoZen-and-Healing-Tao-Qigong-Meditation\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>TaoZen brings traditional Qigong and Neigong into our 21st Century urban lives.

Abuse ladies comes in many forms abusive men are also known as sociopath- narcissistic- antisocial sociopath) antisocial sociopath is what my ex- husband was actually diagnosed with when he was sent to prison. I would like everyone to bear in mind that regardless of what problems these men may have there is no excuse in anyway shape or form for their behavior or to abuse or mistreat another person in fact statistics have shown these men know exactly what they are doing and to who they are doing it to also that they are not capable of empathy or remorse statistics have proven that a very small- very small I empathize here percentage of abusive men change please keep that in mind.I have been through extensive therapy and still attend therapy once a week I have researched and read numerous books on abuse all kinds of abuse I have attended Many domestic violence meetings and groups I was asked to speak at a domestic violence benefit back in 2012- I will post my speech on the site- I do this because one it helps me to understand things on a different level regarding domestic violence , myself and the behavior of the abuser . SECOND it gives me the information and knowledge I need to help myself and other woman &nbsp;before it could possibly be to late. I had another group located in Brooklyn before starting this one that actually went extremely well but I had gotten sick for a little while and &nbsp;had to closed that group because I wasn't well enough to keep up with it. I have a GREAT amount of compassion-understanding and an anonymous passion to reach as many women as I can to help them realize abusive relationships are not normal or healthy in fact they are extremely dangerous not only just on a physical level but financially -Verbally and can be extremely emotionally devastating to the point where our self-worth and self-esteem are almost nonexistent everything I write here is because I have been through it and without support and the right people in your life it can be extremely hard to overcome it's sad to say but the truth is some people may never overcome what &nbsp;they have been through but with support and the right people and knowledge we can heal. it has &nbsp;been my experience that only people who have been through the same situation can really feel and understand our pain I remember I had two women in my last group one woman said to me he doesn't really abuse me he just hits me once in a while and calls me names another woman said and this is the woman I asked to leave my group said that it was okay for men to behave verbally or abusive because that's how she grew up and what her parents did and that it was excepted back then I do not agree with this at all please don't get me wrong I was not being mean or un sympathetic the woman I'm talking about is actually a friend of mine I tried to make her realize that this is not acceptable and that no one has the right to mistreat anyone then or now so I simply said if this is your beliefs &nbsp;on this matter that it would be better if she didn't attend the group just for the fact that I did not want any woman or anyone to think that abuse is acceptable or okay She actually understood we are still friends but unfortunately she thinks it's okay for men as she puts it to get a little crazy and I believe for this reason she is not able to have a healthy stable relationships for long periods at a time I will always be there for her and love her very much I have faith that one day she will get it right I also might add that at times I let her know that she is welcome to attend the group to listen and learn. My story goes something like this and I'm sure a lot of women can relate I met my ex-husband Jeffrey in early 2009 Jeffrey was loving understanding very giving very caring told me all the things I wanted to hear At the time when I met Jeffrey I had just recently come out of a relationship it wasn't an abusive relationship just that the gentleman I was with who was actually a very &nbsp;good man had gotten caught up with drugs wouldn't get help and I didn't want to be in that type of relationship that type of relationship isnt &nbsp;abusive but it is however dysfunctional in my opinion okay back to Jeffrey it was only a few months before Jeffrey's true colors came through it &nbsp;kind of started very saddle almost as if you wouldn't notice &nbsp;it But I saw it from the start. at that time because of my own insecurities and self-esteem I chose to ignore it and pretend nothing was wrong &nbsp;so what started &nbsp;with verbal abuse neglect disrespect eventually ended in physical abuse I was verbally abused almost on a daily basis with some of the most cruel hurtful words I have ever heard if Jeffrey didn't get what he wanted or if you didn't act the way he thought you should be he became very angry and aggressive I should mention I hid Jeffrey and our relationship from my family for most of the time we were together why you might say? for one because I knew he was an abusive man But at that time I believed I loved him and didn't want anyone to say why don't you leave him get away from him I had so many insecurities and my self-esteem you couldn't pick up with &nbsp;a shovel that in my head I thought it was better to be with him because my mind was telling me who would want you Antoinette as time went on the abuse got worse and worse verbal abuse constantly physical abuse to the point of a blackeye a dislocated shoulder many &nbsp;bruises &nbsp;lifting the mattress in the air while I was sleeping and throwing me off &nbsp;the bed hitting the dresser against the wall which has now cost me several herniated disc standing and arguing with him one day he grabbed my feet well my ankles which caused me to land on my back and hit my head and causing more injuries now to my neck I remember for some reason a particular time that stands out in my head Jeffrey and I had just gotten married it was only two weeks after our marriage we had a huge fight and I threw him out and he went to stay in a hotel I found out months later he actually had an affair with a prostitute in that hotel I didn't know that at the time I took him back I let him came back home and &nbsp;and he wanted to have sex So we had sex in the Middle of sex he decided to grab me and push me half out the window naked calling me a whore telling me I like it let everyone see the whore u are this was Jeffrey's way of humiliating me and getting back at me for throwing him out Jeffrey as most abusive man are extremely manipulating not to mention they can be very charming and that is how they are able to &nbsp;get you to want them even more manipulating abusive men tend to look for vulnerable weak insecure unstable &nbsp;women they are on the prowl for easy prey I'm sure some of you must be saying why would I put up with something like this but ladies and I'm sure a lot of you know there are many many reasons why women put up with abuse And one of the reasons for this &nbsp;group is to bring out the points of why we put up with abuse recognize them understand the reasoning and put ourselves on a journey to healing there is more to my story and yes with a happy ending that I will talk about in our group meetings also this doesn't have to only be in groups one on one meetings are also available for women who are not comfortable yet talking in groups. For me the first step in &nbsp;recognizing abuse was to admit there was abuse and to believe that I am worth more then to be mistreated &nbsp;and to reach out for &nbsp;help and support&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>

Our old Meetup group got deleted but we hope you all find us again! Michelle Joni's Skipping Club is a fitness party in motion that brings back the joy of skipping. The Skipping Club Summer 2014 season is May 29 - Aug 7, a full summer of themed skipping adventures. Right now, it's training season at Little Skips in Bushwick, where you can skip and learn all about it April 10, 17, 24, and 26 at 2PM. For New Yorkers in the know, Skipping Club is a great source of fitness, a dose of joy in our week, a visceral way to get outside our comfort zones, an excuse to dress up, and a way to journey back to our youth. It's also a unique way to see the city and a faaaaaahbulous social outing. Every Thursday at 2 - and select happy hours, nights and weekends, Skipping Club skips a one-mile route, with intervals, exploring a new neighborhood around the city. From the Upper West Side and Central Park to Williamsburg, dive into a new theme - sartorially and spiritually. Enjoy curated music, improv-style games, meditations, urban adventures and a delicious hand-picked food and drink spot. Come skip, rediscover your playful innocence, paint the streets with joy, emit waves of positivity into the universe, and find your rhythm! I invite you to step into my imagination... and yours.","lon":-73.9300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":65656202,"name":"Michelle Joni Lapidos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/highres_192131052.jpeg","photo_id":192131052,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/member_192131052.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/thumb_192131052.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Michelle Joni's Skipping Club","id":13957042,"state":"NY","urlname":"Michelle-Jonis-Skipping-Club","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Skippers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397737378000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"improv","name":"Improv","id":53513},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"people-that-like-stand-up-comedy","name":"people that like stand up comedy","id":422202},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002},{"urlkey":"comedy-show","name":"comedy show","id":424022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/comedycraver\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Comedy Craver Meetup is open to lovers of comedy.

We hold our events in different places in central NJ, so don't pay too much attention to the listed group location!<\/p>\n<p>We focus on a form of energy healing known as Reiki. What is it? It is better understood when broken apart. Rei is universal Wisdom and Ki is life force energy. When put together, Reiki means Universal Life Force Energy that is Divinely Guided. What Divine means is completely up to you: Reiki carries no dogma and requires no specific way of thinking, so it is compatible with any religion or set of beliefs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When people practice Reiki, they put aside their ego and thoughts to act as a simple channel for the energy, the same way a wire allows electricity to pass through. Anyone and everyone can benefit from Reiki, as the energy helps regulate blocked or deficient Ki. Your Ki is affected by your state of mind and your day-to-day life, and energetic disturbances eventually cause illness and dis-ease. \u00a0Reiki practitioners help restore your body, mind, and spirit to the natural state of pure perfection.<\/p>\n<p>Reiki is a way to purify the holistic self, reduce stress and anxiety, and ultimately further one on his or her spiritual journey. Each person takes something different away from a session, because Reiki is always for your best and highest good. If you've never received it before, we encourage you to come to a share so that you can have a taste and see what it's all about.<\/p>\n<p>Come join other beautiful souls as we share, explore and unfold the magic of Reiki!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74.4300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/highres_353782452.jpeg","photo_id":353782452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/600_353782452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_353782452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":123272232,"name":"Lindsay Barber","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/highres_241727166.jpeg","photo_id":241727166,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/member_241727166.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/thumb_241727166.jpeg"}},"members":147,"name":"Reiki Love New Jersey","id":13963922,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Reiki-Love-NJ","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Beautiful Souls"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397753633000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nursing","name":"Nursing","id":385},{"urlkey":"registered-nurse","name":"REGISTERED NURSE","id":18933},{"urlkey":"licensed-vocational-nurse","name":"LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE","id":18934},{"urlkey":"licensed-practical-nurse","name":"LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE","id":18935},{"urlkey":"nursing-student","name":"Nursing Student","id":37195},{"urlkey":"nurses","name":"Nurses","id":55568},{"urlkey":"nurse-practitioners","name":"Nurse Practitioners","id":134860},{"urlkey":"nurses-network","name":"nurses network","id":151025},{"urlkey":"networking-for-nurses","name":"Networking for Nurses","id":154006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dedicated-Nurses-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for nurses past, present and future who appreciate the devotion, hard work, caring, and especial rewarding nature of the career that is nursing.

By nature, for the past few years anyway, I've turned into a real worrier and pessimist, due to a few downturns in my life, so I thought I could use this class. Well, there was another bump in the road in my family life (my daughter lost her job) but instead of my typical hand-wringing, poor us, reaction, I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement for her...automatically, without trying. I feel I've been re-wired by Mark's weekly guidance and my subsequent daily practice. Would I say it's a miracle? \u00a0I think so......

Primordial voice is given to every single human. It is and intelligence on its own, the most amazing inbuilt guidance system, it is a healer within. PV is active in children up to the age of 3 years and can be activated during sexual experience, a serious illness or a form of mourning which is actually a healing vibration.<br>\n\nThrough Primordial Voice Technique you can reach untapped phenomenal abilities everyone possesses. These abilities are often hidden deep inside and accessed through the power of one\u2019s own Primordial Voice, a very powerful teaching allowing to re-recognize one\u2019s own strength.<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice teaches you to reach forgotten self confidence and live in agreement with your own true self. A grown-up person has 2 voices: a \u201cthinking\u201d voice which is active, and primordial one which is usually dormant. A \u201cthinking\u201d voice is a voice connected to the intellect that communicates the data registered by the brain. The vocal cords and muscles are used to produce a thinking brain. Primordial Voice is connected to the \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cheart\u201d , it is produced by trachea and smooth muscles that are connected to our subconscious mind. It communicates our inner wisdom, our inner guidance; it says, \u201cI lead you, I guide you\u201d.<br>\n\nKnowing your Primordial Voice and recognizing it is the most powerful tool to the secret of life, making the right choices, committing to the right situations, and interacting with the right people. Remember, you have spent many years trying to change yourself just to fit the general standards, to acquire qualities that are not yours and do not reflect your unique nature. The question is whether or not you have succeeded? And does your success set you free?<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice is not about changing or improving: it is about KNOWING yourself and living in accordance with your TRUE SELF. Knowing who you are is the key to your freedom. The PV program is a course consisting of several stages of special exercises, breath work and energy work, and although it takes time to master this technique, even one hour of this work will give you the experience of what it is like to be your own master. Suppression of your Primordial Voice creates patterns of disharmony and disruption of your body\/mind connection and well-being.<\/p>\n<p>By opening to Primordial Voice and freeing its movement in your body, you will experience:<\/p>\n<p>Connection with the source<br>\n\nFreedom of the creative force within<br>\n\nFeelings of bliss and happiness<br>\n\nA strengthening of your intuition<br>\n\nA shifting of blocks in your life force (Qi)<br>\n\n??????????????????????<br>\n\nPersonal power<br>\n\nA deepening and improvement in your voice<br>\n\nAn expansion of personal skills and professional effectiveness<br>\n\nYou will be heard!<br>\n\nAnd you will learn how to heal yourself with Primordial Voice on a deep physical and emotional level.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/4\/8\/highres_356174152.jpeg","photo_id":356174152,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/4\/8\/600_356174152.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/4\/8\/thumb_356174152.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":143611642,"name":"Lada Levit","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/6\/2\/highres_193148802.jpeg","photo_id":193148802,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/6\/2\/member_193148802.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/6\/2\/thumb_193148802.jpeg"}},"members":256,"name":"Primordial Voice Meditation in New York","id":14092382,"state":"NY","urlname":"Primordial-Voice-Meditation-in-New-York","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Great Neck","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1398458371000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"landlords","name":"Landlords","id":484},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"commercial-real-estate","name":"Commercial Real Estate","id":16671},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-RES\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Premier Real Estate Network.<\/p>","lon":-73.7300033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/2\/4\/highres_356363332.jpeg","photo_id":356363332,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/2\/4\/600_356363332.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/2\/4\/thumb_356363332.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13510134,"name":"NY Real Estate Society","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/3\/8\/highres_193336952.jpeg","photo_id":193336952,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/3\/8\/member_193336952.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/3\/8\/thumb_193336952.jpeg"}},"members":121,"name":"NY Real Estate Society","id":14107292,"state":"NY","urlname":"NY-RES","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"NYRE Society Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1398471052000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"russian","name":"Russian Language","id":982},{"urlkey":"expatrussian","name":"Expat Russian","id":3511},{"urlkey":"russkie","name":"Russkie","id":16510},{"urlkey":"russians","name":"Russians","id":20978},{"urlkey":"russian-food","name":"Russian Food","id":28522},{"urlkey":"russian-culture","name":"Russian Culture","id":28841},{"urlkey":"russian-speaking-families","name":"Russian Speaking Families","id":37547},{"urlkey":"russian-parties","name":"Russian Parties","id":45163},{"urlkey":"russian-moms","name":"Russian moms","id":49821},{"urlkey":"former-ussr-countries-culture","name":"Former USSR Countries Culture","id":60072},{"urlkey":"russian-parents","name":"Russian parents","id":171374},{"urlkey":"russian-speaking-moms","name":"Russian Speaking Moms","id":285001}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Russian-American-Network\/","rating":5,"description":"Russian American Network goal is to join forces to build stronger Russian-speaking community in NYC Metro.

It is reassuring beyond words to know this truth - which we demonstrate through Mediumship (communications with spirit). Our mission is to share the light, love and knowledge of spirit without divisive dogma or restrictive rules. We create an open and loving atmosphere within the Church; one which welcomes people from all faiths and denominations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A MEDIUM AND\/OR MEDIUMSHIP?<\/b><br>\n\n A medium is a person who is sensitive to the thought and energy vibrations which come to us from those in Spirit. A medium can attune to the Spirit people, and is able to describe them and relate their thoughts, emotions, memories, and messages. Mediumship is a natural gift of the Spirit and has many purposes: it brings comfort to the bereaved; it offers spiritual nourishment for the soul; it becomes a vehicle for God\u2019s Healing Spirit; and it demonstrates the potential of the individual to break through self-imposed limitation and, thus, become part of a Greater Whole.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL HEALING<\/b>?<br>\n\n An important part of of the Spiritualist experience is healing. Healers are simply channels for healing; the source of all healing is God. Our trained and designated healers direct healing light and energy according to each individual's needs. At every Sunday service during a period of meditation, we offer the opportunity to sit in one of our healing chairs for hands-on energy healing (given by a touch on your shoulders).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>IS SPIRITUALISM A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION?<\/b><br>\n\n Spiritualism is the vehicle through which all religions have been given birth. We embrace the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth. We consider Jesus a great prophet, medium and healer. His connection with the Divine was so strong that one could consider him as God's Presence on Earth. Was he the only such manifestation of God's Love and Grace? No. During times of spiritual crisis, God sends messengers of the Word to help guide us; Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna and Mohammed, to name a few. One can be Christian and a Spiritualist; one can be Jewish and a Spiritualist; one can be Buddhist and a Spiritualist; etc.<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n SUNDAY SERVICE:<\/b><br>\n\n The highlight of our Church week is Sunday worship. Our worship service integrates music, prayer, healing, meditation, inspiration and Spirit communication into the beautiful and unique experience of Spiritualist worship. Each week our church invites a guest minister. Sunday service begins at 11:00 AM and ends at approximately 12:15 PM. You are cordially invited to join us in the Church Hall for coffee, refreshments and fellowship following the service. (Doors Open at 10:30 AM for Silent Prayer and Meditation).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>The Typical Order of Service:<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Opening Song and Prayer<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Declaration of Principles<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Sermon \/ Sharing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Healing Prayer and Meditation<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Laying-on-of-Hands Healing<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Offering<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Announcements<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Hymn<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Spirit Greetings (Mediumship)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Closing Song: \"Let There Be Peace on Earth\"<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>WORKSHOPS:<\/b><br>\n\n Our guest ministers and other spiritual practitioners provide workshops on various subjects relating to Spirituality, Mediumship Development, Psychic Development, Healing and much more.

Sounds good so far. Almost two thousand years earlier another also very sharp Greek dude named Aristotle wrote that not only is happiness the greatest good, it\u2019s the only end in life, everything else being just a means. Okay, that makes sense too.<\/p>\n<p>This group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions:<\/p>\n<p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>2. Spend more time socializing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>5. Stop worrying<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<\/p>\n<p>8. Become present oriented<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>10. Work on a healthy personality<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>11. Be yourself<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Here's some background on the research our group is based on:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

I formed this walk group for people who are new to the area (or old) or even considering moving into an area and would like to explore the different cool parts of the towns and cities along the Hudson. I always feel that people move into a specific area only after having probably zipped through the neighborhood sitting in a car. Well yes, one does get a \"vague\" idea of the place but do you really get to enjoy it? Then do you come back again and again to take in the flavour? Maybe, maybe not. So as a way to give back to the society I decided to form this meetup. Usually the walks will not be over bearing or long. However for your &amp; everyone else's enjoyment, you have to be physically fit to be walking and being on foot for at least an hour or more. To keep it interesting we can end the walk in an interesting place to eat or drink from time to time. Every meetup we'll be exploring different areas for Jersey City, Hoboken and West NewYork. If you want more cities to be added feel free to get in touch with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/6\/0\/600_358735392.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p>*Members should understand and agree that they will be obligated to pay the bill for the food or drinks they have incase the meetup ends at a place of food or drinks.<\/p>\n<p>*As a member of this group you are not allowed to solicit other members for your products, business or services. NO EXCEPTIONS! This is a meetup for fun lets keep it that way.<\/p>\n<p>* If you RSVP to a meet you are expected to show up.<\/p>\n<p>*No shows will be strictly not tolerated! You have to inform at least 24 hours in advance.<\/p>\n<p>* You have to wear comfortable and appropriate clothing and foot wear.<\/p>\n<p>Liability Waiver:<br>\n\n Walking and similar outdoor activities have inherent risks associated with it. Your participation in my walks, carpools or other events could be dangerous and can result in serious injury, medical emergency or even death.

This makes it different from more legit hockey leagues in the area and probably more fun.

Whether you are a longtime meditator or new to the practice, you are welcome to join us. Instruction will be given. Together, we can practice staying grounded in the present moment by stopping, focusing on our breathing, and observing our thoughts and feelings without getting lost in them. By sitting and walking in this way, we can gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By continually practicing with the support of community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened and our concentration deepens. There will be guided and silent sittings and a period of walking meditation, along with a reading and time to share and practice mindful speech and listening. The practice is influenced by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, Pema Chodron, and the teachers of the Insight Meditation tradition. There is a suggested donation of $10.

Traditional street hockey comprises sticks and sneakers. Not roller-blades. While we do sometimes play roller hockey, you&nbsp;should assume that a given session is the traditional sort. You're welcome to bring your roller blades and muck about in them before or after our sessions.&nbsp;<\/span>Occasionally, we also mix things up such that each team, for example, will have have 4 people in sneakers and two in blades. And it always works.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our games tend to run at an intermediate level. While some players are quite advanced, others are sometimes completely new to the game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you're totally new to the game, you should feel welcome. If you'd like some tips or even lessons, I'm happy to offer them - and for free. &nbsp;I love coaching, and my experience at it is fairly decent: I've coached people of all abilities - including players who went on to make pro leagues. Most recently, I provided one-to-one training for a 2014 US women's deck hockey player. Feel free to take me up on the offer because I really do enjoy it!<\/p>\n<p><span>There is a small fee for each session. Just $5.

But if you don't have a stick, write the organizers and they'll be able to bring you one. &nbsp;Make sure to specify if you shoot Left or Right!<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p><span>While we don't require that you wear any protective gear (and while most people don't even wear gloves), you should seriously consider the merits of gloves, shin&nbsp;<\/span>guards, mouth guards, and helmets with cages.<\/p>\n<p><b>RULES<\/b>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Standard rules of hockey apply, with some minor exceptions (see below).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To help ensure safety - especially for those who choose not to wear helmets, face masks, mouth guards, or shin guards - we have a few very strict <i><b>'stick-related' rules<\/b><\/i>:<\/p>\n<p>1.
