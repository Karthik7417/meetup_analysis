The brewery and destination-taproom, which opened in April of 2105, opens Sunday nights as a showcase style stand-up comedy club open to the public 21+ with no cover charge or ticket fee. Guests are able to order charcuterie boards, dinner and pints during, before and after the show. With a Sunday night show time of 9PM there is ample free parking is available.<\/p> <p>Season 1, the 2015 dates are as follows: September 13th, 20th and 27th, October 4th, 11th and 25th, November 1st 8th 15th and 22nd December 6th 13th 20th and 27th.<\/p> <p>The opening night on September 6th filled to capacity and guests were entertained by 7 professional comedians and show host C.J. Browne. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to offer a curated show of experienced local comedians. Since the room and setup require excellence the showcase is not an open mic night. We are absolutely psyched about the success of opening night. We played to a full house that loved the show.\u201d Show performer Gary Peterson says \u201cThe Slumbrew comedy show was such a fun room to work, because the owners care about making it fun. A packed house of young heroes supporting the local scene makes this place special.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/226247612\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"HEARTS NIGHT  with  Good Friends and Food in Medford","id":"226247612","time":1448407800000,"updated":1448631361000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"438 Somerville Avenue","name":"Cambridge Hackspace @ P.irateship","lon":-71.10244,"id":24079947,"state":"MA","lat":42.381321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.22099041939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440949966000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Spend some time on your project by bringing it along to our weekly project night, an evening designed around you and what you're working on.<\/p> <p>This weekly event is about finding time to tinker, being creative, and meeting other members of the community. \u00a0You'll get the chance to see what others are working on, share your projects, and to get inspiration and feedback from fellow tinkerers.<\/p> <p>On any given Tuesday night you have people working on\u00a0electronics, knitting, writing code, wood-working, or just their plans for world domination.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<\/p> <p>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Now, for the first time, acclaimed historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire.<\/p> <p>In An Indigenous Peoples\u2019 History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz adroitly challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military. Shockingly, as the genocidal policy reached its zenith under President Andrew Jackson, its ruthlessness was best articulated by US Army general Thomas S. Jesup, who, in 1836, wrote of the Seminoles: \u201cThe country can be rid of them only by exterminating them.\u201d<br\/>\u00a0\nSpanning more than four hundred years, this classic bottom-up peoples\u2019 history radically reframes US history and explodes the silences that have haunted our national narrative.<\/p> <p>.........................<\/p> <p><br\/>Because of space limitations, a maximum of 16 people can attend.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door).

Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

As a young teenager, Julian became serious about music as a career. Since then, discoveries and pursuits have ranged from intense classical studies, to the expressive world of jazz and improvising, as well as many fiddle and folk traditions. The Appalachian music surrounding Julian\u2019s home in Asheville NC has been central to his musical upbringing. In addition to gigging and playing in various bluegrass and folk bands, the most developmental experiences have been the countless hours of jamming and learning from fellow musicians. Julian is currently a 3rd-semester student at Berklee College of Music where he studies jazz violin among other styles and skillsets. Julian\u2019s passion for music is rooted in its emotional impact, and the power it has to transcend reality and unify people. Overall, Julian strives to be at the forefront of musical innovation and create down-to-earth music that respects existing musical traditions while staying fresh at the cutting edge.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Ethan Setiawan<\/b> is a mandolinist from Goshen, Indiana. Before turning 18, he managed to participate in Savannah Music Festival\u2019s Acoustic Music Seminar, was awarded a full ride scholarship to Berklee School of Music, performed on NPR syndicate Prairie Home Companion and won the 2014 National Mandolin Championship. While he started on cello in third grade, he was drawn to the mandolin after getting bored learning ukulele. Soon after, Ethan was traveling around the country going to mandolin and music instructional events such as the Mandolin Symposium, the Swannanoa Gathering and the Berklee 5-Week Summer Performance Program. Though Ethan is currently attending Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA, he took lessons from jazz mandolinist Don Stiernberg through high school. Other artists he\u2019s studied with include Clarice Assad, Bela Fleck, Julian Lage, Daniel Hope, and Mike Marshall.

Includes an all out five course meal and fancy wine choices (an organic wine usually etc). I've gone before and its the best meal ever and you'll be glad. Its also super healthy with lots of vegan, gluten free, and healthy options if you're into that (like I am). There's also dessert if you're into that (like I am too!) We did this last year with half a dozen of us ladies and met new friends and had fun. Its an upscale food selection but you can come more casual if you like no pressure to dress up. But I've bumped into super hot body builders there so you never know ;) No stress to RSVP here since I'm not taking meetup payments and payment $85 (ouch!!! but it includes 5 course dinner 1 drink and tip etc so worth it a good value) is required in advance to make it easy on us all. If money is a problem I'll split it my dinner with you for $45 each since there's a split service charge. You can Facebook wire to pay so there's no spaz last minute if you flake. These events are very stressful to organize the day of the event so feel free to RSVP here and when you are sure you are coming and ready to pay you may RSVP on Facebook for a seat I'm\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1697230817180061\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1697230817180061\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1697230817180061\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0to wire the payment, there is also a Facebook event for this meetup but all RSVP are tentative without full payment in advance. No messing around with cards\/cash\/payment at the event because its a set price anyway (or half meal) for the meal and you can choose from about 2-5 different options for each of the five courses. I'm friends with Casey Lee (Casey D) and a lot of other ladies from this group for years who know I'm a real person and I've scheduled and organized meetups for over a year and they're super fun! Other ladies also know we have to be lame strict about payment or ladies will flake and the other group members or organizer has to pickup the tap and there is a cat fight (I'm gonna win I'm now a Lion) and I hate that nonsense drama.<\/p> <p>Payment policy is as follows: send me a friend request and you can wire $45 to split with me or another lady or $85 for your own meal, its worth it and my personal preference but I absolutely will split with any lady if she wants to come but money is a factor. If there are two ladies who want to eat like birds and split their dinner I'll let you two ladies do $45 each so I can have my own meal. Its a holiday lets have fun! I am friends and Facebook friends with ladies here already.<\/p> <p>LAST MINUTE: There is a good chance there will be extra room at the event if you want to rsvp last minute that's also fine before 5 pm. The option is to split the dinner with myself or another lady if you wanna do last minute. I want to be as welcoming as possible to new people and also it helps if someone else flakes you can take their place and its cool for everyone. But don't just show up \u00e5nd crash that's lame and disrespectful. This is a 20s - 30s young ladies dinner party, not a hacker space or IT security event (those you're supposed to crash into that's a community that encourages free spirits).<\/p> <p>Here's the Menu: (all tentative and subject to add-ons and specials because its a harvest meal and what's in season)\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.walnutgrille.com\/harvest-dinner-special\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.walnutgrille.com\/harvest-dinner-special\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.walnutgrille.com\/harvest-dinner-special<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I know it is expensive but it is a special holiday treat for those of us who have worked hard all year and want to enjoy a foodie event then this is definitely it. (Or for people who are working very hard to try to work hard that works also don't kill yourself for a paycheck lol;) The food is killer! I haven't met someone who's complained and I'm acquainted with the chefs he's super VIP level quality specialty chef. Thanks for your interest!

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix. While these are general guidelines, always read the comments section for the latest\u00a0updates for today's meetup.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonSoccer\/events\/226782360\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":6300000,"name":"Friday Lunchtime Soccer (OUTDOOR)","id":"mvjjglytpbkc","time":1448644500000,"updated":1448668788000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1338390106000,"name":"Lunchtime Soccer Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":3969152,"urlname":"BostonSoccer","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.68380987644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446734395000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(Note: Carpools available!)<\/p> <p>Join Ben and Regan for a day of games at their annual Day After Thanksgiving Leftover Pot Luck.\u00a0 Arrive whenever you're ready and leave when you want to.\u00a0 We'll be ready for guests by 1 and won't kick anyone out before\u00a0midnight.\u00a0 If there is enough interest, we can game throughout the night.<\/p> <p>What to bring (select all that apply ;)<\/p> <p>Games - We have plenty, but we don't have them all.

There are great views of the presidentials from ledges just south of the Owl's head peak and more from the Mt Martha peak. The ascent is a mix of easy and more difficult grades through hardwood forest. There is a steep section to the col between the two peaks. The descent will be fairly easy following a snowmobile route.<\/p> <p><b>Totals: 7.0 mi, 2663' of elevation gain, 4:20 book time\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level: Intermediate\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sunset is at 4:15 pm<\/b><\/p> <p>Depending on the time we finish, weather, etc...

Some people hike faster, some slower, some like to be in front, middle, or back. Some like to hike a steady pace, others like to stop often.

Do not worry about keeping up with the person in front of you, but DO keep an eye on the person behind you. Someone will be the slowest person in the group. It may be you. Congratulations, you set the pace.<\/p> <p><b>EQUIPMENT:<\/b>\u00a0You should be equipped for a winter day hike including plenty of food and water, multiple layers of clothing (NO COTTON), sturdy trail shoes or hiking boots, rain gear, head lamp, sun block, a hat, and basic first aid supplies.

His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature. This may explain how and why he developed a mind that simultaneously admired arts and appreciated the sciences. Dr. Sung has a B.S. in Psychology from Soochow University in Taipei, , an M.A. in Linguistics (with a minor in Cognitive Science), an M.A. in Educational Psychology (with a minor in Psychology), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in Psychological Foundation, Learning, and Cognition, and a minor in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Psychology).\u00a0<\/p> <p>He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students. He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative.\u00a0<\/p> <p>From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives. Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015. He is also an Associate Professor at NWHSU.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He is currently developing a not-for-profit organization (YUAN3 CHIH4 EDUCATION) to promote global sharing of educational and health care resources.

Dr. Yung-Chi Sung M.A., Ph.D.<br\/>Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Yung-Chi grew up in a family of teachers. His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature. This may explain how and why he developed a mind that simultaneously admired arts and appreciated the sciences. Dr. Sung has a B.S. in Psychology from Soochow University in Taipei, , an M.A. in Linguistics (with a minor in Cognitive Science), an M.A. in Educational Psychology (with a minor in Psychology), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in Psychological Foundation, Learning, and Cognition, and a minor in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Psychology). He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students. He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative. From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives. Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015. He is also an Associate Professor at NWHSU. He is currently developing a not-for-profit organization (YUAN3 CHIH4 EDUCATION) to promote global sharing of educational and health care resources. In his spare time he enjoys reading, writing, dreaming, dancing (recently salsa and argentine tango), and occasionally playing poker (currently no-limit Texas Hold\u2019em).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonchina\/events\/227002466\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Spiritual Art of Chinese Calligraphy and Tai Chi","id":"227002466","time":1448722800000,"updated":1448731670000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286765768000,"name":"The Boston China Interest Network \u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5174\u8da3\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1720042,"urlname":"bostonchina","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":1.23526775837,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429481060000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi there,<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a great group for any skill level.\u00a0 People will match themselves up for mixed doubles play for social and skill play.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP to both sessions if you want to play after 1st session ends.

Lured by the promise of America, Eilis departs Ireland and the comfort of her mother\u2019s home for the shores of New York City. The initial shackles of homesickness quickly diminish as a fresh romance sweeps Eilis into the intoxicating charm of love. But soon, her new vivacity is disrupted by her past, and she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.

To an Irish girl coming across the ocean, the New York borough is an unknown, a blank space for reinvention \u2014 or perhaps simply invention, since Eilis Lacey is something of a blank space herself. But it\u2019s 1951 and there\u2019s nothing for her in County Wexford, so she goes along with her family\u2019s decision to ship her off to the States. Perhaps the place name will come to mean something to her, or she to it.<\/p> <p>To\u00edb\u00edn\u2019s book is a subtle and masterful portrait of a passive-aggressive heroine \u2014 a girl who goes along and lets others do for her until she finds herself stalled at a crossroads of her own making. The movie, fashioned by talented experts, is something less merciless and more lovely to behold. Crowley and his creative team \u2014 cinematographer Yves B\u00e9langer, designer Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9guin, composer Michael Brook, costume designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux \u2014 build a cinematic snow-globe of nostalgia, a portrait of two worlds that aches with family lost and freedoms found. It is a beautiful film to<i>experience<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Eventually, there\u2019s a young man, Tony (Emory Cohen), an Italian kid with a thing for Irish girls in general and Eilis in particular. Cohen can be a mannered actor \u2014 in \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d he piled on the baby-Brando shtick \u2014 but he brings a gentleness to this movie that allows Ronan\u2019s Eilis to come into herself as a person. Maybe the movie\u2019s Tony doesn\u2019t have the rough edges of the book\u2019s, and maybe that makes some of Eilis\u2019s decisions easier in the long run, but that\u2019s in keeping with the movie\u2019s essentially benign view of human nature.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here we get into spoiler territory; consider yourself warned. A family tragedy calls Eilis back home to Ireland, where she stuns old friends with her new sophistication and comes into the orbit of Jim Farrell (reliable Domhnall Gleeson, looking more like his father Brendan than usual). Suddenly the life that was denied her before is available, and right there is the choice: the old world or the new?<\/p> <p>The girl hesitates for the longest time, and Ronan \u2014 who probably has a less romanticized view of her character than we do \u2014 finally lets us feel the fear that lies behind Eilis\u2019s passivity. Yet there\u2019s a cruelty between the lines of To\u00edb\u00edn\u2019s novel that has been smoothed over in this film; the jaws of the author\u2019s trap are covered in movie velvet. The deep, abiding sadness and hope we feel in the final frames of \u201cBrooklyn\u201d are more comforting than the last lines of the book, in which Eilis looks to the horizon and forces herself to imagine nothing more. To\u00edb\u00edn wrote of the ways our lives choose us. The movie, by contrast, dramatizes how we choose our lives. You come away from the screen version of \u201cBrooklyn\u201d fully satisfied and a little less enriched by doubt.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the lobby after the movie and go to a nearby restaurant for discussion.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group\/events\/226771845\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Brooklyn","id":"226771845","time":1448745300000,"updated":1448851065000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1155954187000,"name":"Boston International\/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":307808,"urlname":"Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Boston","address_1":"338 Newbury St, 3rd flr","name":"Karma Yoga Studio -- Newbury","lon":-71.086685,"id":19514562,"lat":42.348469,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.16876602173,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422410774000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join me this Saturday at Karma Yoga Studio (right above Trident Cafe on Newbury St.) for \"Namaste Saturdays\" which is a 45 minute meditation class followed by 30 minutes of group reiki.

Though the descriptors vary widely by country and region, here are some more commonly used ways to describe the wide variety of rum that is available:<br\/>\u00a0\n<b>Gold rum<\/b>, also called \"amber\" rum, is a medium-bodied rum that gets its dark color from aging in a wooden barrel. More flavorful than light rum, it is considered midway between light and dark varieties of rum.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Dark rum<\/b>, also known as brown, black, or red rum, depending on its actual color, is a grade darker than gold rum. It is usually made from caramelized sugar or molasses. Because it is aged longer, the result is a significantly stronger flavor than light or gold rum. One can detect hints of spices, as well as strong molasses or caramel overtones. In addition to providing the substance for many rum drinks, dark rum is the rum that is most commonly used in cooking.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Flavored rum<\/b>\u00a0 is infused with flavors of fruits, such as banana, coconut, or orange. A flavored rum is generally less than 40% alcohol, and is most often used in tropical-themed mixed drinks, but can also be served by itself, either neat or on ice.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Light rum<\/b>, often called \"silver\" or \"white\" rum, in general, has very little flavor except for its sweetness. Light rums are sometimes filtered after aging to remove any color. Light rum is frequently used in mixed drinks rather than drunk by itself, due to its lack of flavor.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Overproof rum<\/b> is significantly higher than the standard 80 proof, and can be as high as 150 or 160 proof. An example of overproof rum is Bacardi rum. Overproof rum is usually used in mixed drinks, rather than served on its own.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Premium rum<\/b> is in a special market category. Premium rums are generally from boutique brands, and are carefully aged and produced. As one would expect, they are more flavorful than \u201cmixer\u201d rums, and tend to be enjoyed straight.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Spiced rum<\/b> is usually based on gold rum, and gets its flavors from the addition of spices such as cinnamon, rosemary, absinthe\/aniseed, pepper, and very often, caramel.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Blind-Tastings\/events\/223535244\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Rum tasting with Caribbean food","id":"223535244","time":1448755200000,"updated":1448823174000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348239833000,"name":"Boston Blind Wine Tastings","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":5036692,"urlname":"Boston-Blind-Tastings","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Tasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"295 Arsenal Street","name":"VFW Hall","lon":-71.170036,"id":12293992,"state":"MA","lat":42.363747,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.12445545197,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446855155000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's time for our annual burn-off-that-big-Thanksgiving-dinner Zydeco dance with Slippery Sneakers.

We're also delighted to have a return performance by guest musician Amanda McCarthy!<\/p> <p>\n\nIn the wake of recent events in American history where people have claimed that the religious liberty upon which America was based is being threatened, Jase will offer a brief insight into where the concept of \"religious liberty\" originated, including its historical context from England and how this shaped early Colonial life. Jase will be using some archival documents from the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford and will demonstrate where some historical facts are stranger than the fiction often believed and reported today.<\/p> <p>\n\nDoors for the event open at 10:00 AM for coffee and conversation, with the program starting at 10:30.

Different spiritual traditions teach methods of \"awakening\" kundalini for the purpose of reaching spiritual enlightenment. The Yoga Upanishads describe Kundalini as lying \"coiled\" at the base of the spine, represented as either a goddess or sleeping serpent waiting to be awakened. In modern commentaries, Kundalini has been called an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force, or \"mother energy or intelligence of complete maturation\".<\/p> <p>Kundalini awakening is said to result in deep meditation, enlightenment and bliss. This awakening involves the Kundalini physically moving up the central channel to reach within the Crown Chakra at the top of the head. Many systems focus on the awakening of Kundalini through meditation, pranayama breathing, and the practice of asana and chanting of mantras. In physical terms, one commonly reports the Kundalini experience to be a feeling of electric current running along the spine.<\/p> <p>For our purposes we will be opening and awakening your energy centers and channels to gain access to and allow your kundalini to \u2018rise\u2019 up and out of your body cleaning and clearing out all that no longer serves your highest good.<\/p> <p><b>During this workshop you will:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Learn what\u00a0Kundalini Reiki is<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0History of Kundalini Reiki<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Learn about the 3 Levels of Attunements<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Learn how using Kundalini can benefit you and others<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Enjoy a guided meditative experience\u00a0 &amp; receive Level 1 Kundalini Reiki Attunement<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Cost $40\u00a0- 2 hour workshop includes manual, level 1 attunement in person, then levels 2 &amp; 3 via remote session, and a certificate (via mail) after your 3rd attunement is complete.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Your 2nd &amp; 3rd attunements will be scheduled and\u00a0be done via remote connection at a time convenient for you.\u00a0 There will be at least 10 days between each attunement to allow for the integration of energy as needed.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nicol is a Certified Usui, Lightarian and Kundalini Reiki Master.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>No prior knowledge or attunements are required to receive and use this empowering energy!\u00a0 Upon receiving your 3rd attunment, you will be a Kundalini Reiki Master and will be certified to attune others. <\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.essencehealing.net\">www.essencehealing.net<\/a> <\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/225272015\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"Kundalini Reiki Workshop and Level 1 Attunement","id":"225272015","time":1448812800000,"updated":1448824653000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brookline","phone":"(617) 734-7028","address_1":"1621 Beacon St","name":"Athan's Bakery","lon":-71.135124,"id":1071689,"state":"MA","lat":42.339253,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":3.62871694565,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446212447000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This great coffee and pastry shop in Brookline needs to be checked out by this group :) We could share Sunday brunch there?<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Chocolate-Club\/events\/226419206\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"http:\/\/www.athansbakery.com\/ ","id":"226419206","time":1448812800000,"updated":1449004972000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1354217236000,"name":"Boston Chocolate Club","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":6048322,"urlname":"Boston-Chocolate-Club","group_lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Chocophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"Near the T stop","name":"Harvard Sq","lon":-71.063408,"id":1084288,"state":"MA","lat":42.325962,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":2.38062906265,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448677213000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi,\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDon't you want to do good?\u00a0<\/p> <p>How about meet new young professionals at the same time?\u00a0<\/p> <p>After doing good we'll walk to one of my favorite local cafes to enjoy food, chat more, meet new young professionals.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nJoin us for the annual Global Warming walk.

The schedule will follow in order:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Safety, Landings and Balance<\/p> <p>Class 1 will be focusing on how to land, move and stay safe practicing Parkour outdoor and in the real world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Vaulting<\/p> <p>Class 2 will focus on the foundation of Parkour - getting over low-level obstacles fast and efficiently through the use of vaulting.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Precisions<\/p> <p>Class 3 will focus on accuracy of jumping and foot\/eye coordination honing basic standing and running jumps.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Wall Techniques\u00a0<\/p> <p>Class 4 will focus on conquering obstacles too large or tall to vault, in tandem with using walls as a means to keep a more efficient run.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Tumbling\/Acro<\/p> <p>Class 5 focus is on tumbling and\u00a0acrobatic\u00a0skills, in pursuit of fully understanding movement in a 3D space and total\u00a0proprioception.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Flow + Speed<\/p> <p>Class 6 links together all the previous lessons into one cohesive movement, and a timed obstacle course setting.<\/p> <p>------<\/p> <p>What if I've never done anything like Parkour before?\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>This class, Parkour 101, is a introductory level class. We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Anything else?<\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewEnglandParkour\/events\/226743756\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"[Boston] Parkour 101 - Introduction to Parkour \/\/","id":"cllfmlytpbmc","time":1448812800000,"updated":1448817216000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284132267000,"name":"New England Parkour and Free Running Group","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1704666,"urlname":"NewEnglandParkour","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Traceurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"Raymond Street","name":"Raymond Park","lon":-71.126945,"id":8316962,"state":"MA","lat":42.386372,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":3.43781137466,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1342868836000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/7\/0\/event_140885232.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Raymond park is approximately ten minutes by foot from the Porter Square Red Line T station.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Raymond Park is at the intersection of Raymond St. and Upland Road.

John Pulling, Jr. climbed the steeple and held high two lanterns as a signal from Paul Revere that the British were marching to Lexington and Concord by sea across the Charles River and not by land. \u00a0This fateful event ignited the American Revolution.<\/p> <p>Founded in 1722, Christ Church in the City of Boston, known to all as the Old North Church, is Boston\u2019s oldest surviving church building and most visited historical site. \u00a0In 1775, on the eve of Revolution, the majority of the congregation were loyal to the British King and many held official positions in the royal government, including the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, making Robert Newman\u2019s loyalty to the Patriot cause even more extraordinary. The King gave the Old North\u2019s its silver that was used at services and a bible.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"296 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Urban-Sketchers-Boston\/events\/227036435\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Sketching the historical North End (and having great coffee!)","id":"227036435","time":1448823600000,"updated":1448897941000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390851834000,"name":"Urban Sketchers Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":12513512,"urlname":"Urban-Sketchers-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Urban Sketchers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"01923","country":"us","city":"Danvers","phone":"978-777-1879","address_1":"66 Maple St","name":"Toys N Things","lon":-70.937019,"id":1079316,"state":"MA","lat":42.567062,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.8631620407,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1365968008000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>TnT's weekly PFS game that runs every Sunday starting at 2PM.

We want to warmly extend an invitation to Deaf people or others fluent\/skilled in the language (CODAs for example) to join our group.<\/p> <p>This is an easy-going, casual, ASL get-together to meet people who enjoy American Sign Language, who want to brush up on their signing skills, and want to learn more ASL by using it as often as possible.<\/p> <p>We strive to have a good time and communicate without using voices. If we need to, we draw or write what we don't know how to sign, and if lots of folks show up, we split up into small groups and mix and mingle, so we can actually see one another clearly, face-to-face and get a good conversation going.<\/p> <p>Don't be afraid or shy if you're not \"perfect\" at ASL, because being \"perfect\" is not the point of this group. No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again. This isn't an ASL class, since none of us are certified ASL teachers, so there's really <i>no<\/i> pressure or expectation--other than that we all use ASL to communicate. We all learn from one another!<\/p> <p>IF you've taken an ASL\/Sign Language class before (<i>or have had exposure to someone who uses the language<\/i>) and know the basics (<i>alphabet, numbers 1-20, and even a small vocabulary of signs<\/i> ), then join us to get your fingers, hands, face and body moving, ASL-style!<\/p> <p>IF you haven't taken an ASL class, or don't know the basics, <b><i>don't be discouraged<\/i><\/b> ... you can come along anyway and learn by watching, and gradually, participating.

But it can be hard to figure out exactly how to ask for what you want, and what the person you're with wants. So let's practice!<\/p> <p>This event is part of Pleasure Pie's Experiential Growth Series. It\u2019s about learning to communicate in sexual situations in a way that makes people feel comfortable and respected, through discussion and practice. :)<\/p> <p>Here's how the evening will go:<\/p> <p><b>Discussion<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll start the evening with a thoughtful conversation about consent. What are some ways you can ask for consent without it being awkward? How can you say yes? How can you say no? How can you react when someone says no to you?<\/p> <p><b>Kissing ice breakers<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll transition into sexy time with some kissing games, like spin the bottle.<\/p> <p><b>Make out time!<\/b><\/p> <p>Next, we will have some time to practice what we've talked about with one another, respectfully. Everyone will be strongly encouraged (but not required!) to ask someone if they can kiss them. Everyone will also be strongly encouraged (almost required) to say no to someone at least once (if you want to say yes to everyone who asks you to kiss, you can say no to someone, and then ask them again in a minute).<\/p> <p><b>Safer space<\/b><\/p> <p>Pleasure Pie strives to create safer spaces. We will share what that means to each of us and come up with some guidelines during this event, but for now you can check out some guidelines we've used in the past <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleasurepie.org\/safer-space-guidelines.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Donations<\/b><\/p> <p>This event is sliding scale. You are welcome to attend for free, or donate $4 - $25. Any donations go to Pleasure Pie for organizing the event and The Democracy Center for hosting us. No judgment on whether or not you donate, and any donation you're comfortable giving is very appreciated!<\/p> <p><b>Accessibility<\/b><\/p> <p>This will be in the Rosa Parks room in The Democracy Center. It is private and cozy. Unfortunately, the building isn't wheelchair accessible. Please let me know if stairs are a hindrance to you.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP<\/b><\/p> <p>You must RSVP to attend this event!

This is for people of all genders, races, ages, etc. Feel free to invite people! RSVP is required.<\/p> <p><b>Is it weird if I don't kiss anyone during this event?<\/b><\/p> <p>You are not required to kiss people!

If you're kissing someone, you are welcome to ask them if you can touch their body, but we are setting a few boundaries:<\/p> <p>1. Don't take off or move anyone's clothes (including your own). Everyone should stay clothed enough to walk down the street.<\/p> <p>2. Don't touch anyone's genital areas (even if it's through their clothes).<\/p> <p>For the record, we have absolutely no problem with sex parties, but this event is not a sex party.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BOSPleasure\/events\/226955890\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Consent is Sexy Make Out Party","id":"226955890","time":1448841600000,"updated":1448853749000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328819937000,"name":"Pleasure Without Borders Boston","group_lon":-71.0299987793,"id":3265302,"urlname":"BOSPleasure","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Sex Positive Intimacy Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":6.94232988358,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447627683000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Taste new flavors among silk curtains, glowing lanterns, and did I mention belly dancers?

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward so we can stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues both as individuals and together as a community. We have seen a huge surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas. We hope you'll come to this session willing to share a current event you've learned about over the past month or so.

Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character,\u00a0Frame by Frame\u00a0follows four Afghan photojournalists as they navigate an emerging and dangerous media landscape\u2014reframing Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9, intimate interviews, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen archival footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects audiences with four humans in the pursuit of the truth.<\/p> <p>Bios:<\/p> <p>When Alexandria Bombach\u00a0and Mo Scarpelli first landed in Kabul in 2012, they were struck by the beauty, hope and complexity of a country that is often represented as war-torn and hopeless. With collective experience shooting non-fiction stories in more than 20 countries around the world, they teamed up to raise $75,000 for the film on Kickstarter, and then returned to Afghanistan in 2013 to find more in-depth perspective of Afghanistan through the eyes of local photojournalists.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/films\/frame_by_frame\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/films\/frame_by_frame\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/films\/frame_by_frame<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/films\/frame_by_frame\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>*****************************************************************<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>About UMASS Film Series (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/films\/frame_by_frame\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/about\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.umb.edu\/filmseries\/about<\/a>)<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>The University of Massachusetts Boston Film Series is an initiative of the Chancellor's Office.<\/p> <p><br\/>The UMass Boston Film Series pays particular attention to emerging and iconic directors of acclaimed documentaries that have obtained recognition for their unique, relevant, and exceptional cinematic efforts.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/226468274\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"tqrcmlytpbnc","time":1448928000000,"updated":1448946236000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","city":"Brookline","address_1":"1402 Beacon St.","name":"Knight Moves Cafe","lon":-71.125008,"id":17048572,"state":"MA","lat":42.34145,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.09387183189,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441845247000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I think it would be fun to try a speed dating event combined with a game night.

The program will begin with a free informational lecture at Cabot Hall (4 Joy Street, Boston) on Monday, November 30th at 7:00pm<br\/>Attendance at the first lecture is mandatory. Students admitted to the program will then attend a follow-up meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 6th, at Cabot Hall followed by two weekends of instruction in the White Mountains on January 23-24 and February 6-7.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/226950695\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytpbnc","time":1448929800000,"updated":1448995164000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","city":"Somerville","phone":"(617) 629-7641","address_1":"424 Highland Ave.","name":"Blue Shirt Cafe","lon":-71.12162,"id":842417,"state":"MA","lat":42.396206,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":3.64066934586,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447425313000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>In his book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Singularity-Is-Near-Transcend\/dp\/0143037889\">\u201cThe Singularity Is Near\u201d,<\/a> futurist Ray Kurzweil says that technology will soon solve our greatest energy, education, health and climate challenges.<\/p> <p>But the skeptics fear that once our machines become literally millions or trillions of times smarter than we are, there is no reason to think they\u2019ll view us any differently than we view ants or pets.<\/p> <p>The military is already commissioning \u2018killer robots\u2019 with autonomous power to use lethal force without human intervention.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?317915-1\/book-discussion-final-invention\">In this C-Span video<\/a>\u00a0(different from the one below), documentarian James Barrat talks about his book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Our-Final-Invention-Artificial-Intelligence\/dp\/0312622376\">Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era<\/a>, in which he explores the threat of runaway Artificial Intelligence.
