A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life. This meditation will occur every Monday evening unless notified otherwise.

However, we regularly do this with the past. Emotionally traumatic events or abuse often lead to a constant replaying of events from our past. We dwell on these events and wish they would have turned out differently. We constantly try to assign blame and find our mistakes. We think of justified retribution that we could employ to get even.<\/p> <p>I believe the old adage of \"living well is the best revenge.\" First, let me say that while this sounds easy, it is not, and that adage doesn't tell you <b>how<\/b>\u00a0to live well. Living well and letting go is a skill. Letting go can be learned and is a valuable coping mechanism for a happier life in the future. The skill is easy to explain, but hard to master and will take long periods of intentionally invoking introspection and self awareness to change your ingrained thought patterns. Below is a list of strategies I use when practicing this skill. Please join us on Monday, May 16, at 7pm where Bob Gordon will be presenting further on how to \"Let go\".<\/p> <p>1) Do not run from your emotions or\u00a0self medicate.

Miller, Howard County politician and businessman. Don Miller was president of Miller Chevrolet and was interested in trees and other plants. One must get permission to visit this small stream valley. It contains a diversity of species: spring beauty, fringe tree, blackhaw viburnum, arrowwood, mapleleaf viburnum, spicebush, oak, hickory, red maple, dogwood, black gum, ash, tulip tree, beech, wild geranium, false solomon's seal, bedstraw, jack-in-the-pulpit, mayapple, New York fern, sensitive fern, blackberry, black cohosh and sedges. This is the fifth year that we will explore this area as we add to our survey of its flora and note changes over time.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Leader:<\/b> Heidi Pringle, Maryland Native Plant Society and Natural History Society of Maryland<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> FREE<\/p> <p><b>Notes:<\/b> A climb down a small steep hill is necessary to enter the forest. There is also a stream crossing that requires a big step over the shallow stream. There are only animal trails, and participants are asked to be very careful not to step on the native plants. The leader has encountered only one tick, but tick populations change each year and there are many deer. Please take precautions for ticks. Wear long pants, since there is an area with poison ivy that must be crossed. There are muddy areas.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> hand lens, pad and pencil\/pen, rain gear, boots<\/p> <p><b>Directions: <\/b>From Rte. 29 take Rte. 40 West past Chatham Road then make the first left onto Plumtree Drive.

Students in this course, which is suitable for all levels, hone their drawing skills by focusing on specimens from the outstanding collection of the Natural History Society of Maryland, which includes beautiful gems, minerals, plants, fossils, seashells and coral, as well as preserved insects, butterflies and moths, reptiles, birds and mammals. On site at NHSM and under the guidance of a drawing instructor, participants will focus each week on a different aspect of the collection, spending time to closely observe, study and render a variety of fascinating natural forms.

But what about the database that the code interacts with? Often the changes needed to bring new functionality to the application are elevated into the QA or production environment manually by a series of scripts with no easy recourse if a misstep occurs. It doesn't have to be that way. Database &amp; Schema migration tools allow a user to push updates in an automated and testable way. When combined with virtual or container technology the team finds that it's possible to bring up a database, seed it with data, run tests against it, and then dispose of it within a matter of minutes.<\/p> <p>Peter Matseykanets is a backend development team lead at LMO Advertising with extensive experience in multiple RDBMS, from open source like MySql to corporate solutions like Oracle. An adherent of automated database migration Peter has become adept at using the technique to drive DevOps at LMO to a new level, allowing database changes to be tested and deployed with a great deal of confidence. He'll be sharing the principles and an example of performing Database &amp; Schema Migrations.<\/p> <p><br\/><i>We will meet at TEKsystems in Linthicum.

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Fox's Den is a popular basement gastropub on Main Street with a doorway entrance located next to Lou Lou Boutiques. It's a casual place with a nice ambience and a trendy menu based around upscale pizza and appetizers. They offer a variety of specialty drinks, wines, and beers. Happy Hour is from 5:00 to 6:00 pm.<\/p> <p><i><b>Fox's Den adds a 20% gratuity to groups of five or more, so make it clear when you arrive that you're a single customer running your own tab.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

Eating or drinking is optional but I certainly plan on enjoying something to eat and drink during our discussion. The Nordstrom Market Cafe is located on the second floor of Norstroms in the Columbia Mall.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Lars Thorvald's wife, Cynthia, falls in love with wine--and a dashing sommelier--he's left to raise their baby, Eva, on his own. He's determined to pass on his love of food to his daughter--starting with pur\u00e9ed pork shoulder. As Eva grows, she finds her solace and salvation in the flavors of her native Minnesota. From Scandinavian lutefisk to hydroponic chocolate habaneros, each ingredient represents one part of Eva's journey as she becomes the star chef behind a legendary and secretive pop-up supper club, culminating in an opulent and emotional feast that's a testament to her spirit and resilience.<\/p> <p><br\/>Each chapter in J. Ryan Stradal's startlingly original debut tells the story of a single dish and character, at once capturing the zeitgeist of the Midwest, the rise of foodie culture, and delving into the ways food creates community and a sense of identity. By turns quirky, hilarious, and vividly sensory, Kitchens of the Great Midwest is an unexpected mother-daughter story about the bittersweet nature of life--its missed opportunities and its joyful surprises. It marks the entry of a brilliant new talent.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Kitchens of the Great Midwest<\/b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library.

Members of Amazing Spiral Healing group receive a discounted price. (Payment plans and scholarships are also available.) Register at thetagrace.com Contact [masked] or[masked] with additional questions. The Towson location will be provided upon registration.<br\/>The heart of this seminar is the practice of techniques that allow you to change life patterns held in place by core, genetic, historic and soul beliefs, either self inflicted or externally imposed. With ThetaHealing we believe you inherit beliefs and emotions from your ancestors. This level we call the genetic level. Students experience an opening to the Unconditional Love of the Creator. The student will learn to identify his\/her own beliefs as well as to practice pulling them for others in the seminar. This practice can quickly reveal systems of belief, showing the body how to replace limiting beliefs or feelings with positive ones.

Members of Amazing Spiral Healing group receive a discounted price. (Payment plans and scholarships are also available.) Register at thetagrace.com Contact [masked] or[masked] with additional questions. The Towson location will be provided upon registration.<br\/>The heart of this seminar is the practice of techniques that allow you to change life patterns held in place by core, genetic, historic and soul beliefs, either self inflicted or externally imposed. With ThetaHealing we believe you inherit beliefs and emotions from your ancestors. This level we call the genetic level. Students experience an opening to the Unconditional Love of the Creator. The student will learn to identify his\/her own beliefs as well as to practice pulling them for others in the seminar. This practice can quickly reveal systems of belief, showing the body how to replace limiting beliefs or feelings with positive ones. Other topics and exercises include:<br\/>*Learn why we create things in our life and what we learn from those experiences.<br\/>*Discernment when working with guides and guardian angels.<br\/>*Introduction to manifesting in your life.<br\/>*Future readings.<br\/>*Balancing moods<br\/>*Soul mates, waywards and implants<br\/>*Seven Planes of Existence<br\/>*The Power of Connecting to the Creator of All that Is<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Healing-Community\/events\/229968536\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":178200000,"name":"Weekend Basic Theta Healing Course","id":"229968536","time":1463776200000,"updated":1463955854000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394040570000,"name":"Baltimore Amazing Spiral Healing Community","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":13174702,"urlname":"Healing-Community","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21794","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"West Friendship","address_1":"2210 Fairgrounds Rd","lon":-76.964615,"phone":"410-730-4589","name":"Howard County Fairgrounds","id":262805,"state":"MD","lat":39.310272,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.516166687,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463589920000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Turf Valley's Preakness\u00ae Celebration Hot Air Balloon Festival Presented By Bob Lucido Team!<br\/>Let's meet at the parking lot at Howard County Fairgrounds and ride over together to Turf Valley for the Balloon Festival.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at&lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0Hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Head towards the water taxi stop near the UA campus.

In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden.<\/p> <p>Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, \"There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...\"\u00a0<i>Slaughterhouse-Five<\/i>\u00a0(taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945.

A lot of people are finding that they are being drawn more and more to the healing arts to help themselves, their families and their communities.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are offering an amazing opportunity for you to learn the first level of Reiki. The class will be delivered by Reiki Master Will Halm who has decades of Reiki healing and teaching experience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Below is a bit more information about Reiki and it's benefits. Please feel free to comment below or contact us with any questions.<\/p> <p><br\/>What is Reiki?<\/p> <p>Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's \"life force energy\" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.<\/p> <p>How can Reiki help me?<\/p> <p>Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery.<\/p> <p>What does a Reiki treatment feel like?<\/p> <p>A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results. In a standard treatment Reiki energy flows from the practitioner\u2019s hands into the client. The client is usually laying on a massage table but treatments can also be given while the client is seated or even standing. The client remains fully clothed. The practitioner places her\/his hands on or near the clients body in a series of hand positions. These include positions around the head and shoulders, the stomach,and feet.Other, more specific positions may be used based on the clients needs. Each position is held for three to ten minutes depending on how much Reiki the client needs at each position. The whole treatment usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes.<\/p> <p>What happens after my session?<\/p> <p>Most of the time a person will feel relaxed and uplifted by a Reiki treatment. However, sometimes a person will have what is called a healing crisis. As a person\u2019s vibration goes up, toxins that have been stored in the body will be released into the blood stream to be filtered by the liver and kidneys and removed from the system. When this happens, sometimes a person can get a headache or stomach ache or feel weak. If this happens, it is a good idea to drink more water, eat lighter meals and get more rest. The body is cleansing as part of the healing process so this is a good sign.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Healthy-Living-Community\/events\/230719689\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Reiki Level 1 Class and Attunement","id":"230719689","time":1463859000000,"updated":1463868339000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1448941429000,"name":"Baltimore Healthy Living Community","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":19170317,"urlname":"Baltimore-Healthy-Living-Community","group_lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":2.82083773613,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463593892000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Can our heroes find out who is snatching young people off the streets of the old city...

This Sacred Fire is known as the Violet Flame of God\u2019s Infinite Perfection.<\/p> <p>We will invoke the frequencies of the 5th-Dimensional Crystalline Solar Violet Flame that Cosmic Law will allow to transform, transmute and dissolve fear based conditioning on a cellular level.\u201d<\/p> <p>Join us for a group Violet Flame meditation, and Sound Alchemy with crystal singing bowls.<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>I will be using Decrees with a guided \u00a0meditation and playing crystal singing bowls. Decrees have a mystical power to them. They invoke the power and spirit of your innate divinity, the power of God that resides within you. Decrees are spoken out loud and release the power of the Word through the throat chakra. Every time you speak a decree out loud, you are drawing upon spirit so that God can act in your life in an expedient way.<\/p> <p>The Violet Flame is a unique spiritual energy that can help you in all areas of your life. It can heal emotional and physical problems, improve relationships and finances, help you grow spiritually, or just make life easier. It is the most advanced spiritual tool given to mankind to cleanse our karma without having to face or problems directly. As my mentor and teacher Liz Draman used to say \"clear the trauma without the drama\". It will literally clear the negativity around a specific situation, illness, etc. when invoked. It transmutes our karmic records into pure light. It has the power to transmute, to change and raise energy that has slow vibration into energy of higher vibration.<\/p> <p>Benefits of the Violet Flame: Transform fear into courage, Transform anxiety into peace, Heal personal and planetary karma, Clears karma at a cellular level, Raises energy body to a higher vibration, Spiritual accelleration, Improves relationships, Quickens the mind, Accelerates personal growth, Purifies negative energy, Transforms families and communities, Rejuvinates the physical body, Transforms illness, and more......<\/p> <p><br\/>If there is a situation in your life that you would like to heal quickly, then this is to tool for you!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/0\/f\/600_447157135.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Off of York Road in Timonium next to Nautilus Diner","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pure-Energy\/events\/226288795\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cancelled - Violet Flame Abundance meditation","id":"rqwnhlyvhbcc","time":1463871600000,"updated":1463881008000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430870560000,"name":"Pure Energy","group_lon":-76.6500015259,"id":18578143,"urlname":"Pure-Energy","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Energizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21048","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Finksburg","address_1":"2912 Club House Road","name":"Cedarhurst Unitarian Universalists","lon":-76.894516,"id":3899262,"state":"MD","lat":39.50079,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.7049980164,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1318168829000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>7:00 to 9:00 on the\u00a0third Saturday of every month.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life.

Things change. Relationships changes. Families change. It is up to you to decide how to view these changes and how to care for yourself and family during these times. With all phases of transition, there are common things you will need and pro-active steps you can take to help make them smoother for everyone involved. Firstly, seeking out others who are going through or have had a similar experience with whom you can connect can give you a great perspective. Knowing what may be on the other side of the change always motivates me. Also, know that the emotions of anxiety, fear, sadness, depression and anger will subside with enough time and perspective. However, they do come in waves and you need to weather those waves by treating yourself with extra compassion when you feel it is warranted. Being emotionally aware is very important here. Also, guard your thoughts and embrace the changes as opportunities. Leaving behind old measures of success and finding the good in your new life is a valuable skill. Life does not end, it transforms.

I was able to talk enough to answer screening questions. Most job fairs are 60 second stand up things with handing a resume, saying what kind of position by title and leaving it at that (along with a line 10 deep behind me). Your event allowed several minutes, and I think that is much better to explain why (the effort is being shut down by the government) and brief expectations on both sides. Many booths seemed to have a technical person and not just HR, which is excellent to eliminate disconnects regarding skills \/ buzzwords.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201dIt was a great experience I had a chance to speak with hiring managers and recruiters. I will definitely be coming to the next event. I would say to anyone that would like to attend should, it is something that is worth while it is something new, much better than the traditional job fair.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201dreStart does a great job - best I have attended\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201dMy first time attending a reStart event. I thought the most impactful feature was allowing companies to review resumes ahead of time and schedule morning interviews. I received two interviews, and was able to discuss how my skills will benefit those companies in a 1-on-1 environment. It shortens the overall timeline for both recruiter and job seeker.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201dit was one of the best setup job fairs i have ever attended\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201dThis was the best part of the event! Thank you for establishing this type of format...sustain!

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us. Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!( <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/events\/231205201\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fairland Ride","id":"dznbtlyvhbgc","time":1464125400000,"updated":1464137445000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1394324650000,"name":"MVD Mountain Bikers","group_lon":-76.9400024414,"id":13234942,"urlname":"MVDMountainBikers","group_lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Mountain Bikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"200 S Linwood Ave","name":"Living Classrooms","lon":-76.577156,"id":24554882,"state":"MD","lat":39.288963,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.29698777199,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":7,"created":1463583182000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":1},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Free Baltimore Yoga hosts a free yoga class in Patterson Park each Tuesday at 6PM. \u00a0We should get there at 5:45pm in order to ensure a spot.<\/p> <p>The class is held in the Living Classrooms Center.<\/p> <p>They recommend that you bring a mat - if you do not have one, there may be an extra there, but there is no guarantee.

To live healthier happier lives. For more information go to our website: www.acourseinmiracles4clearvison<\/p> <p>It is my greatest pleasure and honor to be able to facilitate the Course in Miracles reading group. During the past 20 years I have heard from numerous people how much the Course changed their view of life and improved their situations. I am gracious for the companionship in learning and in constantly reminding myself how to release fear, and experience peace, joy and direction in my life. I am grateful for the gift of living more in the Now, and less in the past and future. I hope you too will have an easier and lighter journey, filled with laughter and joy by making the Course principles part of your daily life.<\/p> <p>Welcome to the study group. If you have any suggestions or needs, please let me know. I have participated in about 10 different meeting groups around the country to learn, and have borrowed some of their formats. I am not a scholar, nor an expert- I do not have the material memorized. I merely study with the group, and the effects on my life have been profound. I do not require participants to prepare for the meetings. Some people do the daily lessons at home, which are highly recommended. Some people read the chapter ahead of time to get an overview. It is nice to have your own book, but this is not mandatory for learning.

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;georestrict=input_srcid:e01105162751571c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17763643535889233356&amp;q=DLA+Piper+LLP+%28US%29&amp;ved=0CBgQpQY&amp;ei=wePyS5iQCYSKsQO8xaGyBg&amp;hq=DLA+Piper+LLP&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=39.379625,-76.654315&amp;spn=0.01161,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed\">View Larger Map<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/i.imm.io\/r6F0.png\" \/> <b>Parking &amp; Transportation<\/b><br\/>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

Our SHR group will gather near the big tree and picnic tables at 6:00 pm to find a good place prior to the performance starting at 6:30 pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>The Old Mill Steel Drum Band is a group of 25-30 high school performers who play a unique style of music from Trinidad right here in Maryland. Starting with four students who gave up their lunch period to play the steel pans in 2000, the program has grown to around 80 students and is still growing.<\/p> <p>The band is under the direction of Michael Miller who studied music at Towson University but is a self-taught pan player and arranger. The ensemble performs many musical styles, including calypso, reggae, jazz, classical, pop, and others. Their original upbeat Caribbean style sends rhythmic vibes that gets your feet tapping, hands clapping, and head grooving with the beat.<\/p> <p>This outdoor concert is free and no tickets are required.

The artistic quality of the works is the sole guiding principle of the ensemble: And thus the Hugo Kauder Trio guarantees musical enjoyment at the highest level in which nothing is left to be desired.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Preview here.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=47yVJki5ORA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=47yVJki5ORA<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/230073043\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Free World Music: Hugo Kauder Trio","id":"230073043","time":1464303600000,"updated":1464316054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6023921967,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1330013648000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This ASL BRIDGE meetup is every two weeks on Thursday evening from 7 to 9 p.m.<\/p> <p>This meet up will meet at Panera Bread<br\/>8541 Georgia Ave. the corner of Colesville Rd.<br\/>Silver Spring, MD --<\/p> <p><b>Parking &amp; Metro<\/b><br\/>The nearest parking garage:<br\/>Town Square Garage, 801 Ellsworth Dr. (NE) and it is free after 6:00 pm.<\/p> <p>Silver Spring Metro Station - Red line stop at Colesville Rd.<\/p> <p>www.silverspringdowntown.com has a good map of where are Panera Bread and the garage.<\/p> <p><br\/>As Evelyn Leonard is no longer hosting this meetup- this meet up now has<\/p> <p>TWO Co-hosts JOEL\u00a0 (2nd THURS. )\u00a0 &amp; KEVIN (4th THURS) of each month<\/p> <p>I am trying a new format for this meetup:<\/p> <p>This format for the 2nd Thursday ONLY:<\/p> <p>Each session should be divided into two groups.

Learning to trust is one of the biggest challenges that individuals face after divorce. Experiencing the breakup of your relationship can intensify trust issues. Because of your past experience, you might approach other relationships warily and come to expect the worst. You may find it hard to even trust yourself. It may seem at times as if you\u2019re wired to recreate the past. However, with courage and persistence, you can learn to trust again and restore your faith in love. One of the hardest things about trusting someone is learning to have confidence in your own judgment. Every person is born with the propensity to trust others but through life experiences, you may have become less trusting as a form of self-protection.<br\/>Trust is more of an acquired ability than a feeling. When you sustain the loss of a relationship due to broken trust, it makes you smarter and more keenly able to extend trust to those who are deserving of it. You can learn to trust your instincts and your judgment when you honestly deal with your fears. If you are able to come to a place of self-awareness and understand the decisions that were made that led up to trust being severed, you can start to approach others with faith and optimism. In the next session we will be exploring what trust is and ways to help being the process of mending broken trust.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Then we will break into smaller groups to \u00a0share our own experiences and\u00a0hear about others experiences. Together we will gain knowledge and insights that we can apply to form a new life and create better relationships with the people we know now and meet in the future.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Orientation Meeting begins at 7:00 PM for new members<\/p> <p>Regular Meeting begins at 7:30 PM.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainCrofton\/events\/230750829\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":6300000,"name":"Single Again - Crofton","id":"pjbvrlyvhbjc","time":1464305400000,"updated":1464384095000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282432684000,"name":"Changing Focus - Single Again in Crofton","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1694643,"urlname":"SingleAgainCrofton","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"5410 Leaf Treader Way","name":"Historic Oliver's Carriage House","lon":-76.853661,"id":9360452,"state":"MD","lat":39.223598,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.3434028625,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463166225000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us for our next Toastmasters meeting on May 26, for an evening of \"Tall Tales\".\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>A few moments from our May 12 meeting are below.

After the classical rendition you will enjoy \u201cingenious and beautiful juxtaposition of jazz treatments against iconic classical melodies\u201d according to Jeffrey Silberschlag, Music Director of Chesapeake Orchestra and Italy\u2019s Alba Music Festival. The performance will take you on a journey of mind bending \u201cWhat ifs;\u201d combining famous classical works with improvisational jazz. Through stories both fictional and funny, commentaries on each piece include an almost believable fantasy allowing you to imagine the possibility of unusual musical classical composer and jazz artist meet ups surprising the listener again and again. The Classical Project trio combines well- known musicians who discovered their mutual love of improvisation, storytelling and their \u2018outside the box\u2019 music tastes. Don Stapleson (flute) is director of the St. Mary\u2019s College Jazz Bands and performs with his group, The Don Stapleson Quartet, and has performed with Ray Charles, Wayne Newton, Nancy Wilson, and Martha Reeves. Pete Fields (guitar) has mastered diverse musical styles and unique guitar techniques with performances in the U.S. and Europe. His repertoire ranges from classical guitar, jazz, and Latin music. His release \u201cStillness of the Heart,\u201d is a collection of compositions for classical guitar and has received airplay throughout the country. Fred Lieder (cello) has been a fixture on the Washington area music scene playing classical, jazz, blues, rock and Celtic. He has arranged rock tunes for solo cello including works by the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Jimi Hendrix, and Carlos Santana. Lieder released his solo instrumental tunes on \u201cCello Blues\u201d and his first book My Cello Has the Blues. Guest pianist Brian Ganz known for his mastery of classical music is considered a leading pianist of his generation. He has performed world-wide with major symphonies and won international prizes.<\/p> <p>The program will open with Softly as in a Morning Sunrise from Romberg\u2019s Operetta \u201cThe New Moon.\u201d Some of the other blended pieces you will hear are Faure\u2019s Pavane, Nocturne in F minor by Chopin, Ravel\u2019s Pavane\u2019s For a Dead Princess, Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, Lieberstraum by Liszt, and Mozart\u2019s Turkish Rondo. For each piece Brian Ganz will play the original classical piece; Don Stapleson follows with brief commentary about how the piece became jazz and then the Clazzical Project artists offer their jazz interpretation.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/230074691\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Fourth Friday: The Clazzical Project","id":"230074691","time":1464393600000,"updated":1464434258000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"9505 Berger Road","name":"Soccer Stop","lon":-76.840172,"id":24114161,"state":"MD","lat":39.173763,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.2890796661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461109092000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Pick-up soccer games to be held at Soccer Stop from 8:00pm - 10:00pm for $10.00 per person. \u00a0Teams will be divided upon arrival.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

If you are already in the park, you can park at the other lots and either ride the road, or paved trails to our pavilion (about 2 miles of road riding), or if not in the park yet you can park along Ilchester Road, and come in via the new bridge over the river, and follow the paved grist mill trail to the swinging bridge (this is for also those of you who do not want to pay to get in).

The destination will be Cacaway Island, a popular day anchorage spot for small boats. Total roundtrip distance for this paddle will be 7-8 miles.\u00a0Bring a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and cold water to stay hydrated.<\/p> <p>Anyone with basic kayak skills should do fine on the protected waters of Langford Creek, but you should be prepared for the possibility of choppy water around Cacaway Island where it nears the larger Chester River. Our group of recreational kayakers look out for each other, but we're not certified experts at rescuing novices.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/e\/0\/600_447668416.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/7\/b\/600_434515419.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>All participants are responsible for their own personal safety!<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Our paddle events have been very successful so far because we stick together as a group in case anyone needs assistance. Let's keep it that way!<\/p> <p><b>Picnic at Cacaway Island<\/b><\/p> <p>Cacaway Island is a small uninhabited island that serves as undisturbed habitat for birds and other wildlife. Visitors may land and enjoy the beaches, but are not allowed to enter the island itself. Our favorite beach is a nice area where we can land the kayaks and have a picnic by the water.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/e\/e\/600_434515534.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/0\/5\/600_434515557.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bring something\u00a0in your kayak that's tasty to eat and drink for our picnic. We never tell people what to bring, but they always exceed expectations to make each picnic a memorable experience. There's plenty to share, and nobody goes home hungry (or thirsty).\u00a0Great <i>al fresco<\/i> dining is one excellent benefit of having a creative and fun group of members in Second Half Rally.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Following the picnic at Cacaway Island, we'll paddle back up Langford Creek to our starting point at Shipyard Landing. We should be back at our cars by 4:00 pm or so.<\/p> <p><b>Renting a Kayak From Chesapeake Kayak Adventures<\/b><\/p> <p>If you don't have a kayak, you can easily rent one from Chuck by making an advance reservation with Chesapeake Kayak Adventures. He rents high-quality kayaks with a life vest and paddle at this event for $55. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Chuck has many years of experience kayaking, teaching, and working with customers at L.L. Bean to help people enjoy paddling. He now runs Chesapeake Kayak Adventures, a mobile kayak rental service that\u00a0provides boats and gear right at the ramp to get you launched safely. \u00a0<\/p> <p>The\u00a0easiest way to arrange for a rental kayak is to\u00a0email Chuck at [masked] so he will have\u00a0your email address for contacting you. He sends invoices via email to those requesting rentals so they can conveniently pay online using their credit or debit card.<\/p> <p>The charges are 100% refundable if the group cancels the event due to weather or if the participant cancels with more than 24 hours notice prior to the event. Call Chuck at[masked] with any questions.<\/p> <p><b>Final Meetup Details<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We'll need good kayaking weather for this event. A little rain won't stop us and can add to the adventure, but we will not paddle in miserable or dangerous conditions.<\/p> <p>I'll post a notice here by 9:00 am on Sunday morning if we need to change plans or cancel due to the weather.\u00a0Call or text Jake at[masked] with any questions.

A devout listener and seeker of Sri Rudram is blessed with both worldly and spiritual benefits such as good health, peace of mind and pure joy. Slowly and steadily it draws the listener to spirituality in the quest of the truth behind human existence. The length of meditation along with the chants will be around 40 minutes. After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life. This meditation will occur every Monday evening unless notified otherwise.

How you react to stress, conflict and insecurity is your adaptive strategy. These are typically carried with us, unconsciously, from our upbringing. When your core beliefs are challenged by others or uncontrollable events in your life, ask yourself, how do I react? What words and emotions do I use to describe the events and who do I say them to? Certain strategies are better than others for resolution. I know from personal experience that ignoring, denying or running away from those conflicts can be detrimental to your emotional health. I first became aware of my strategies while reading the book entitled \"Adult Children of Alcoholics.\" Below is the exercise from the book that I was reflecting on at the time. Please join us on Memorial Day, 30 May, where Bob Gordon will be presenting on how to identify dysfunctional coping strategies and what you can do to adjust them.<\/p> <p>\"Take this simple little test. Imagine that you are walking down a hall. There is a door in the hallway. You are about halfway down the hall and coming out of that door is someone you are very angry with or someone you know to be angry with you. What do you do? Do you stand your ground and confront that person[?]... Or do you turn around and walk away? Do you make some frivolous remark that has nothing to do with what you two need to work out?

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us. Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>3\/1 \u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/8 \u00a0Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\/15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stephen Clarke \u00a0 \u00a03\/29\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p><br\/>4\/5 \u00a0Stan \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4\/12 Mira \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04\/19 \u00a0Stan \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4\/26 Mira<\/p> <p><br\/>5\/3 \u00a0Stan \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5\/10 \u00a0Mira \u00a0 \u00a0 5\/17 \u00a0Stan \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5\/24 \u00a0Mira \u00a0 \u00a05\/31 \u00a0Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.
