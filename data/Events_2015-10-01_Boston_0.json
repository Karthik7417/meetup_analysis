All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

This training will give you the confidence to pursue your personal and professional goals - from the importance of shaking hands and making eye contact, to tips on the best opening line and how to exit a conversation gracefully. An amazing side benefit is that you'll learn how to create a welcoming community space by keeping an eye out for outliers, considering yourself a host instead of a guest and knowing how to compliment someone without \"othering\" them.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>ABOUT OUR PRESENTER\u00a0<br\/><b>Robbie Samuels<\/b> has extensive community organizing, events logistics and fundraising experience. He offers capacity-building trainings and consultation to non-profit boards, development professionals and grassroots organizers.\u00a0In 2006 he co-founded Socializing for Justice to build a cross-cultural, cross-issue progressive community and network in Boston based on the philosophies of abundance and radical inclusion. In 2011, in recognition of his social justice work, Boston City Council named his birthday, September 16, \"Robbie Samuels Day\".

First of all, it must be said-- Robbie is VERY FUNNY. In fact, the workshop felt almost more like a comedy show than a skill-building workshop. It was awesome. Apart from being highly engaging, Robbie was also insightful, informative and wonderfully practical. As someone who often has trouble getting out of dead conversations, I felt like I came out of the workshop with concrete strategies for how to wrap up and end a conversation BEFORE it dies. On the flip side, Robbie also has a number of great stock comments\/questions to help keep conversations from prematurely dying. Now, I consider myself an extrovert but it is still extremely helpful to get such a clear explanation of what kinds of questions help deepen connections, and which kinds of questions one should avoid. From handshakes, to body stances, to where to keep your business cards, Robbie knows the ins and outs of how to make connections and keep them. I got so much out of this workshop. I only wish I could sit through it again (and again and again...).\" ~Beck Epstein<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSCHEDULE<br\/>6:00-6:30 Socializing -\u00a0\u00a0<b>bring your own dinner<br\/><\/b> 6:30-8:30 Training and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p><b>*\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nonprofitcenterboston.org\/site\/c.ddKGIQNuEmG\/b.1363373\/k.5381\/About_Us__Directions.htm\">DIRECTIONS<\/a> - The NonProfit Center<\/b> is located one block from South Station at 89 South Street.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/224222894\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Open Cards and Board Game Night in Medford","id":"224222894","time":1441146600000,"updated":1441164254000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861220598221,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1324425033000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Available public transportation:<\/p> <p>1.

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/224912143\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytmbcb","time":1441146600000,"updated":1441158532000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Broadway","name":"One Broadway Garage","lon":-71.083275,"id":24048844,"lat":42.362217,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.696388721466,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440451591000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's time for another connected car meet up.

ENET is assembling a panel of successful founders who made it big in different fields who will tell you what was important in their success. On September 1, 2015, the kick-off meeting to ENET's 25th year, we will hear stories of entrepreneurial challenges, surprises, disappointments, victories and triumphs. We hope you will join us. Learn from the experts: founders who have had the courage and tenacity to step out on their own, and navigate the rough waters of the unknown, and made it big in doing so. If you are thinking of starting your own business, or if you are already a company founder, learn from those who have gone before you. What they have experienced may help you avoid a pitfall or two, and accelerate your own company's progress. Why reinvent the wheel when others willingly share their wisdom? Our meeting begins with an open networking session. A question and answer session follows the presentation, and panelists are available afterwards for responses to individual questions.<\/p> <p><b>Panel:\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Diane Hessan\u00a0<\/b>is a successful entrepreneur, marketer and author.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

If you can't come on time, that's fine, we usually have a large group until 8:00 PM. M.J. O'Connors is open until 2am if you want to stay extra late, but they will open up the room to the public at 9:00pm.<\/p> <p>* If you have SciFi\/Fantasy Books or DVDs that you don't want anymore, feel free to bring them to the meetup and give them away (no sales, please). Be sure to take home anything that isn't claimed before you leave!<\/p> <p>* There is no charge for this meetup, but the restaurant that hosts us greatly appreciates your business (and doesn't charge us a room rental fee), so please come hungry (or at least buy a drink). Also, please don't forget to pay your bill before you leave!<\/p> <p><br\/>TRAVEL:<\/p> <p>It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the Park Street T stop (Red and green) and a five minute walk from either Arlington and the Boylston stops on the green line<\/p> <p>There are pay parking lots around.

What are the economic implications, for Keynes, of a man skipping dinner (or perhaps ordering chicken instead of steak) and holding his savings as cash? For Hazlitt?<\/p> <p>2. In what limited circumstance does saving not necessitate future consumption or investment for Hazlitt? Does this happen often with cash savings? Even in this limited circumstance, might Hazlitt be wrong?<\/p> <p>3. Suppose a farmer, instead of spending his money on whiskey as he usually does, saves up his money to buy a tractor that can double his output: What are the macroeconomic effects of this? Does it matter whether he puts his money in a bank or under his mattress?<\/p> <p>4. Successful speculators buy when the price is high and sell when the price is low. When do money speculators buy? When do money speculators sell? How does this relate to the business cycle?<\/p> <p>5. Keynes says, \u201cEvery act of saving involves a \u2018forced\u2019 inevitable transfer of wealth to him who saves, though he in turn may suffer from the savings of others.\u201d What is he trying to say here?<\/p> <p>6. Can cash savings increase or decrease with a constant money supply? If everyone doubled the % of their income they save in cash, what would happen macroeconomically? Would this be possible if investment and savings were by definition equal, as Keynes postulates? What would happen in a world of minimum wage laws?<\/p> <p>7. What happens when a bank increases its loans without a corresponding increase in deposits, macroeconomically? What changes if the loan goes bad? What happens when a banking cartel or central bank does this? Is Keynes right that banks can expand the money supply at will without an increase in savings?<\/p> <p>8. Is a longer production process necessarily more profitable? What would this assumption imply? In a market economy, what will happen to investment in long production processes that are no more profitable than shorter production processes?<\/p> <p>9. Keynes hypothesizes that, with enough efficient state management of capital, the marginal efficiency of capital could be reduced to zero, i.e. investments won\u2019t be more profitable than a savings account and so there will be no incentive to invest, and state or nonprofit management of capital will become necessary. Is this similar to the Venus Project\u2019s hypothesis of a zero cost world?<\/p> <p>10. Keynes introduces the concept of \u201cown rate of interest\u201d in Chapter 17. How does this do away with the interest\/profit distinction?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"You can reach our Director of Events, Natalya, @ 774-284-0420.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Austrian-Economics-Group\/events\/225022462\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Capital, Interest, and Money","id":"225022462","time":1441234800000,"updated":1441247065000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1349279652000,"name":"Boston Austrian Economics Group","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":5224182,"urlname":"Boston-Austrian-Economics-Group","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Praxeologists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02139","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","phone":"617-547-3721","address_1":"4 Pleasant Street","name":"Pandemonium Books & Games","lon":-71.105592,"id":875759,"state":"MA","lat":42.366253,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.87152814865,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427312437000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>D&amp;D Encounters is an exciting, weekly campaign that plays out one epic encounter at a time.

To access and maintain that truth of who we really are requires us to let go of any limiting beliefs, habits, memories. Then we can more fully embrace and embody the higher consciousness of our true Self.<\/p> <p>No matter where you are on your path of awakening, you will love this sacred way of being in divine energy! Whatever you want next in life, this program will help you achieve it with ease and grace. The Divine Presence becomes apparent as unconditional love and joy.<\/p> <p>Judy\u00a0guides this class based on\u00a0her ongoing deep studies in the area of conscious awakening. \u00a0The sweet, profound results of expansion in consciousness occurs in moments. At these meetings we can freely express and connect with like-hearted souls as we share in these powerful energy transmissions. All are welcome to join us and share your own experience of conscious awakening...your challenges, inspirations, intentions and joys. If being in sacred energy appeals to you, you will love this gathering.<\/p> <p>Following our personal energy activations we will gather as a group to send healing to Mother Earth and all her creatures.<\/p> <p><i><br\/>\"So much peace, it's amazing.\"<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/events\/224848279\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":7200000,"name":"Spiritual Awakening--enter into Divine Grace","id":"224848279","time":1441234800000,"updated":1441243496000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1239209619000,"name":"Evolving Beings","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":1429576,"urlname":"Evolving-Beings","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Evolving Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Abington","address_1":"340 Centre Ave","name":"D'Ann's Sports & Entertainment Restaurant","lon":-70.932098,"id":23799486,"lat":42.1101,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.6899833679,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439400818000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>EXTREME Rock &amp; Roll Bingo.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

We can meet in the lobby by the stairs at 6:45 PM to try and get seats together. There are a number of places nearby to meet before or after the movie - we can use the comment section to coordinate plans. If you can't make it at this time or at this place there are showings in CT and NH too.<\/p> <p>===============<\/p> <p>I am not sure when this event will actually happen - it looks like it will open at the Kendall Square Cinema in Boston on or\u00a0around\u00a0August 29th - there is a \"meet the\u00a0director\" event on that date.

Sitting 21,000 feet above the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the mountain\u2019s perversely stacked obstacles make it both a nightmare and an irresistible calling for some of the world's toughest climbers. In October 2008, renowned alpinists Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk arrived in India to tackle Meru.<\/p> <p>Their planned seven-day trip quickly devolved into a 20-day odyssey in sub-zero temperatures with depleting food rations. Within 100 meters of the elusive summit, their journey\u2014like all previous attempts\u2014fell short of the goal.<\/p> <p>Heartbroken and defeated, the trio returned to their everyday lives. By September 2011, Anker had convinced his team to reunite and undertake the Shark's Fin once more, under even more extraordinary circumstances.<\/p> <p>Winner of the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for Documentary,\u00a0Meru\u00a0is the story of that journey, an expedition through nature's harshest elements and one's complicated inner demons, and ultimately on to impossible new heights.<\/p> <p>==========<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/YvS6O9lVkkg\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/YvS6O9lVkkg<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/random-hikers\/events\/224668829\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"Meru (Film Series)","id":"224668829","time":1441322100000,"updated":1441744310000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1178284310000,"name":"Random Group of Hikers","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":492954,"urlname":"random-hikers","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Randomites"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Lexington","address_1":"9 Piper Road","name":"Temple Emunah (2nd Floor)","lon":0,"id":23646111,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.2828245163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1404783395000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come on down and sing it out with Vocal Revolution this Thursday!

That's probably not an exaggeration. Much.<\/p> <p>For the first time ever, EIGHT of Boston's premiere sketch teams are going to share the same stage on the same night, presenting sides of themselves you have never seen before. Each group is going to start off with one of their best sketches - polished, hilarious, well-acted. The cream of the crop, is what we're saying. Then they're going to dig into their backlog of rejected sketches - stuff that never made it to the stage for reasons of sheer terribleness - and they're going to do a staged reading of that sketch for your dark amusement. Each group is going to cap it off with a story about the genesis of their group: behind the scenes tales of madness and mayhem you'll have to hear to believe<\/p> <p>Featuring the sketch groups you know and love: World of Hurt, Vitamin Snake, Baby Cut, Mister Bismuth, The Rekcus, Brainfox, Centaur Stevens, and of course, High Country. Is this the best way to kick off your September?

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

No longer relegated to the battlefield; the sword changed as its wear became commonplace in society. Blades slimmed and guards became more elaborate as the sword evolved into a nimble thrusting weapon worn by commoner and noble alike.

My grandfather taught me the game and we played thousands of games during my childhood. Along the way, I became the co-High School Champion of Philadelphia.<\/p> <p>After over 75,000 games of chess played, I am always ready for more. I look for every opportunity to exhibit, learn, play, and teach the game that has been so great to me over the years. My goal is to play 200,000 games in my life and I am well on my way there.

This week we will continue to build on what you learn in the studio and take the class outside. If you attended part one, you will have more advanced assignments and\u00a0opportunity to practice what we learned in this session.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you did not attend part one, YOU ARE WELCOME to join this week and I will get you started with the basics that were covered in the studio. \u00a0You do need a camera that has a macro (flower) setting. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>We will really focus on creative composition skills which can then be applied to any type of photos you take in the\u00a0future.<\/p> <p>Because several of you missed this workshop I am offering it again right away. This Saturday afternoon I am combining my two favorite topics in one special photo opportunity: <b>Mindfulness and Macro Photography.<\/b> Get ready to go slow, see deeply and experience a shift in how you perceive the beauty of life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start over by the Charles River. The light will be beautiful that time of afternoon making your macro shots even more dramatic.<\/p> <p>This shift will allow you to create photos that connect your inner and outer experience in the moment. I will be introducing some of the key ideas from my book Flow-tograph: The Curious Soul's Guide to Intuitive Photography.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/3\/8\/600_379833592.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf you have a macro lens, this is the perfect time to break it out and really learn how to use it to full advantage. If you don't have a macro lens fear not! You can use the close up\/flower setting on your camera.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Before you can really connect, you need to shift into a more contemplative mindset. I will guide you through some simple mindfulness exercises you can use anytime any where to help you slow down and be more present. These simple techniques will immediately open your eyes to more subtle qualities of <b>color, light, texture and shape<\/b> that usually go unnoticed.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/0\/2\/600_129458402.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bokeh Technique: Japanese aesthetic of blurring the background so your subject captivates our attention and appreciation. This will be one of the techniques I will introduce during the workshop.<\/p> <p><b>What you will learn during this workshop:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to enter the \"flow\" state using mindful breathing techniques<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to maintain a contemplative stance while walking in nature<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0What camera settings are best for macro photography<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to create the Bokeh effect and blur the background<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to make sure your subject is in sharp focus and properly exposed<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to use creative composition for added impact<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/1\/8\/600_389898712.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You will also receive lesson cards summarizing the content of the class and assignments so you can practice again on your own after the workshop.

This hike features a ridge walk with many excellent views.

Everyone will be waitlisted until responses are screened.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please have your preferences for this Meetup set to receive messages from other members, in case I have further questions for you.\u00a0Similar, recent hiking experience is required. Guests are not allowed, everyone must be a member and signup individually. Dogs are welcomed but must be screened for ability as well.<\/p> <p>Weather conditions may cause this hike to be changed or cancelled. Updates will be given as we get closer.<\/p> <p>=========================================<\/p> <p><b>THE HIKE: \u00a0<\/b>The start is at a trailhead just outside of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/recarea\/whitemountain\/recarea\/?recid=74549\">Wild River Campground<\/a>. This is a first come, first served facility, so camping is a possibility but not guaranteed.<\/p> <p><br\/>From the campground we cross a suspension bridge and go up the Moriah Brook Trail which is described as \"<i>an attractive trail, passing Moriah Gorge, traversing beautiful birchwoods that have grown up after fires, and providing fine views up to the impressive south cliffs of Moriah<\/i>.\"<\/p> <p>We will go across the ledgy ridge up to Mt Moriah by the Carter-Moriah Trail passing several\u00a0outlooks, ledges, and excellent views. We continue on the Kenduskeag Trail across the ridge down from Moriah and up to Shelburne Moriah which has excellent views and is very exposed. From there we'll descend past two knolls with more views into the Wild River Valley.<\/p> <p>We'll descend by the Shelburne Trail and the Highwater Trail along the bank of the Wild River, crossing the suspension bridge, to close the loop and return to the trailhead.<\/p> <p><b>Totals: 16.32 mi, 3750' of elevation gain, 10:05 book time<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Level: Advanced, due to mileage and elevation gain\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>==========================================<\/b><\/p> <p><b>PACE:\u00a0<\/b>We will hike together. Some people hike faster, some slower, some like to be in front, middle, or back. Some like to hike a steady pace, others like to stop often. By signing up we have all agreed to a general average pace of <b>2.0+ MPH<\/b> which can be reached by any combination of these methods.<\/p> <p><b>HIKING AS A GROUP:\u00a0<\/b>We will stop and regroup at all trail junctions, water crossings, or anywhere the trail may be unclear.\u00a0What I like to suggest is that everyone hikes whatever way they prefer but stay with the group. Do not worry about keeping up with the person in front of you, but DO keep an eye on the person behind you. Someone will be the slowest person in the group. It may be you. Congratulations, you set the pace. Cucumber.<\/p> <p><b>EQUIPMENT:<\/b>\u00a0You should be equipped for a 3 season day hike including plenty of food and water, multiple layers of clothing for a variety of temperatures (NO COTTON), sturdy trail shoes or hiking boots, rain gear, head lamp, sun block, a hat, and basic first aid supplies.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture.

I will start at 3 with anyone who has thought about trading in their annoying weed wacker for a scythe, we will learn how to sharpen and properly use a scythe. I own 2.5 acres and have only mowed once this season. A scythe can be an alternative to regular mowing although the ultimate goal is to produce hay. At about 4 we will have a tour of the various garden beds and the early stage food forests including the hugelculture swale we started a year and a half ago. If people are interested in staying after I will have grass fed burgers from our herd and probably a lot of bbq'd zuccini. Finally as a bonus, if anyone is interested I will give a brief tour of our fossil collection which includes all 5 classes of aquatic gnathastomes which if you know what that means your probably interested.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Join us for our second event in this series, where we bring in a new educational technology, and brainstorm interesting games with a purpose. This time around, we'll have the NeuroTinker team on-site, looking for design partners for their project, NeuroBytes.<\/p> <p>NeuroBytes are tabletop electronic neuron simulators that are primarily targeted for educational use, but their decision engine \"yes-no\" behavior and the way they can be physically connected together in unique configurations opens up many possibilities for use in gaming and play. NeuroBytes can also be incorporated into networks of environmental input and output devices that work with light, sound, and motion, among many other possibilities. Joe Burdo, one of the co-founders of NeuroTinker, will bring some NeuroBytes that can be freely connected and played with. He will also demonstrate a knee-jerk reaction simulation that he and Zach Fredin, the other co-founder of NeuroTinker, are building for the physiology educational community. Their website can be found at www.NeuroTinker.com<\/p> <p>We'll be in the Havana Room, where our regularly scheduled meetings are held, one hour early.

After that, parking is a little tricky in Cambridge (lots of \"resident only\" signs), but you will find available parking on Mount Auburn St. near Friend's House and on Brattle St. as you head away from Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>Coming by the T is a great option, with the Friend's House being a lovely 15 minute walk out of Harvard Square.<\/p> <p>If you find you are running late, come anyway! The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/225054174\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytmbkb","time":1441668600000,"updated":1441680547000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"17 Water Street","name":"Harrington's Irish Pub","lon":-71.068794,"id":23774446,"state":"MA","lat":42.50251,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.8666677475,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440534538000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/d\/a\/1\/600_441307585.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Whether you have never danced a Quickstep, Jive or Waltz or you want a refresher course, these classes are for you.<\/p> <p>Begining on September 7 and continuing for 4 weeks, Tom Collis will teach you what you need to know to feel comfortable at weddings, Ceilis and other dances.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/8\/8\/600_441374984.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Tom is an experienced teacher from Ennis County Clare Ireland.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

What a Concept!<\/b><\/p> <p>This talk will explore the ongoing effort to realize semantic interoperability in health information exchange. Healthcare providers are increasingly challenged to not only provide care for patients, but to also document their efforts often in excruciating detail. Meaningful Use has increased the urgency that providers develop and sustain these efforts. While an overriding goal of Meaningful Use is better health through better health information ultimately leading to improvements in healthcare delivery, there are many differences in the way medical information is conceptualized by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administration, and insurance companies. This is particularly critical during transitions of care (movement of a patient from one setting of care to another), but even when communication occurs, knowledge is not always shared, because sender and receiver attach different meanings to the same message. An important outcome of the Meaningful Use initiative is the standard and uniform representation of patient information across all certified EHRs. This topic is significant and timely for several reasons, especially as Meaningful Use entered a penalty phase in 2015.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/d\/b\/600_441553019.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Tomasz A.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/224222923\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"HEARTS NIGHT  with  Good Friends and Food in Medford","id":"224222923","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441812211000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":2.0672056675,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1337548177000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We start off chatting about our work, including setting goals for ourselves (which is entirely optional but super helpful!), and then we write.

Not all of them are pretty. Join Boomerang, a Unitrends company, for an in-depth technical discussion covering the benefits and risks of migration, as well as an example process to replicate VMs into AWS, and to remodel these VMs as native AMIs. Use cases include one-way migration, using AWS for backup \/ DRaaS, and cloud bursting from VM environments into AWS.

As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/224889350\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytmblb","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441764752000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Boston","address_1":"1626 Tremont St","name":"TGI Friday's","lon":-71.104691,"id":23932256,"lat":42.333679,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":2.54418110847,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440015626000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/8\/e\/highres_100130062.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come join Richard and friends for a night of\u00a0Magic: The Gathering\u00a0over at\u00a0TGIFridays\u00a0in Boston.

This attitude is not restricted to meditation practice, but is true with many of our most cherished projects, in life and work as well as in spirituality. We come in early with a sense of what we are there to do. But in many ways, this agenda becomes our biggest obstacle and limitation. It ties us to expectations, rather than to the spontaneous and uncontrolled freshness of the present moment. The teaching of non-meditation challenges us to drop our agenda, to drop even our sense of \u201cdoing\u201d.

Flaubert was inspired to turn Emma Bovary into \u201ca knight in skirts.\u201d Freud studied Quixote\u2019s psyche. Mark Twain was fascinated by it, as were Kafka, Picasso, Nabokov, Borges, and Orson Welles. The novel has spawned ballets and operas, poems and plays, movies and video games, and even shapes the identities of entire nations. Spain uses it as a sort of constitution and travel guide; and the Americas were conquered, then sought their independence, with the knight as a role model.<\/p> <p>In Quixote, Ilan Stavans, one of today\u2019s preeminent cultural commentators, explores these many manifestations. Training his eye on the tumultuous struggle between logic and dreams, he reveals the ways in which a work of literature is a living thing that influences and is influenced by the world around it.<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Featuring a selection of works from across the landscape of contemporary craft, the exhibition includes more than 30 emerging and established international artists. Looking to a broad range of materials and practices, the exhibition explores the connections between craft and performance; the opportunities provided by new technologies and materials; and the power of rethinking craft\u2019s interactions with architecture and\u00a0space.<\/p> <p>This exhibition is the first of its kind within an encyclopedic museum to explore the broad possibilities of contemporary artistic engagement with craft. By examining these interactions in proximity to historical examples in the MFA\u2019s collection, \u201cCrafted\u201d demonstrates the vitality, viability, and variety inherent in choosing craft as a foundation for contemporary artistic\u00a0practice.<\/p> <p><b>Nature, Sculpture, Abstraction, and Clay\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>100 Years of American Ceramics<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>This exhibition explores ceramic art from the late 19th century to today\u2013from the Arts and Crafts movement to Midcentury Modernism to Studio Craft and contemporary practice. Outstanding works that display the transformative nature of clay include objects drawn from the MFA\u2019s rich holdings as well as a number of local private collections. The exhibition features more than 70 works organized into three thematic sections:\u00a0Sculpture and Abstraction, Nature and Landscape,\u00a0and\u00a0Surface and Decoration. Many of the objects have never before been on display in a museum, with the majority making their MFA debut. Pushing the boundaries between functional and sculptural, the works demonstrate unprecedented experimentation not only with forms, colors and glazes, but also with the role of clay as an artistic and sculptural medium. Highlighting the connections between contemporary art and the art of the past, the exhibition explores each generation\u2019s distinct style, examining how the potter has been redefined as an artist, and how ceramics have been redefined as a vehicle for artistic expression. Diverse highlights includeThe Pine\u00a0tile manufactured by Grueby Faience Company around[masked],\u00a0Gourd-shaped vase form (model no.J821)\u00a0by Gertrud and Otto Natzler from 1958, and a newly acquired porcelain sculpture,\u00a0December\u00a0(2013) by Cheryl Ann\u00a0Thomas.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Amazing-Social-In-Boston\/events\/222977161\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"MFA free Wednesday Art of Craft","id":"222977161","time":1441835100000,"updated":1441847382000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1336275388000,"name":"\ud83d\udca5 Amazing Social In Boston","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":3807302,"urlname":"Amazing-Social-In-Boston","group_lat":42.2999992371,"who":"Socialites"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brockton ","address_1":"716A Crescent St","name":"New England Comics","lon":-70.990311,"id":22506742,"state":"MA","lat":42.081268,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":19.7256793976,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1411242763000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We play Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Munchkin, and may others.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Got a game you want to play?

Java 8 brings greater expressiveness to the language, and allows concurrent programs to be more readable and reasonable. This talk introduces a few concurrent programming paradigms, and offers a deep dive into Deterministic Dataflow, which allows sequential algorithms to be systematically parallelized.

The leader (Bob Barnes) of the Wedeln Ski and Snowboard Race Team will hold dryland training every Wednesday night this Fall. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer. Bob's enthusiasm for skiing and training is contagious, he will get you working hard and getting results. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat. Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for the ski season.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/5\/600_10414789.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. Darlene Stokes and Tom Lane will also lead the group in additional exercises designed to increase flexibility and build a strong core. Last year we had many people from Meetup join us for these workouts. Some even became regular guests up at our ski house in NH. Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. The workouts last 1.5 hours and are always immediately followed by a few drinks and sometimes some food at a variety of Waltham Center Bars\/Restaurants.

Conventional treatment relies on a course of antibiotics, but with the rise of drug-resistant bacteria this approach has two major flaws: first, the antibiotics may be ineffective at eliminating the pathogen (while still quite effective at disrupting your gut flora \u2013 making you more susceptible to future infections); and second, even if they do work, continued use will only lead to more resilient bugs in circulation.<\/p> <p>Herbs offer an alternative. Their mechanisms of action are varied: some prevent adherence of the bacteria to the walls of the urinary tract, some disrupt the biofilms bacteria form to protect themselves, some kill the invading pathogens directly, and many simply improve the health of the affected tissues to the point that they can fight off infection under their own power.<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll introduce you to a variety of useful herbs in this class, and show you how to prepare and administer them for best effect \u2013 in tea, tincture, sitz bath, and more.

At this point we pass the mic around and have a group discussion about the topic. When the discussion wraps up, we continue with more refreshments and socializing until around 9:00 when all attendees are welcome to join our open steering committee meeting.<\/p> <p>We \u00a0take donations at the door to cover the cost of the meeting ($5 is suggested).

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!
