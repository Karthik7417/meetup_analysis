So I think .. perhaps, you would like it too, especially at the time close to the end of the year ... Signing up means you've read it here. Thanks.<\/i><\/p> <p>~~<\/p> <p>Dear Friends in Christ, In January of 1996, a modern interpretation of Giacomo Puccini\u2019s La Boheme opened off Broadway. The show, called Rent, enjoyed a successful 12-year run and many of the songs of its score still play on in the minds of its fans. One of Rent\u2019s more popular tunes, entitled \u201cSeasons of Love,\u201d asks a simple yet provocative question: How do you measure a year? The lyrics go on to suggest a few ways: You can measure a year \u201cin daylights, in sunsets, in cups of coffee.\u201d In the next stanza, some other possibilities: \u201cIn inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife.\u201d Finally, the song finds its way to the best possible means of measurement: Love. You can measure a year in love; by the way you love and were loved; and to the degree that you held love above every other gift and virtue. Who can possibly argue with that?<\/p> <p><br\/>And so we, as a church (within a wider Church) within a world, begin a very special year that we would be wise to measure well --the Jubilee Year of Mercy. It was first announced by His Holiness Pope Francis in April 2015 in his letter Misericordiae Vultus. These Latin words mean \u201cthe face of mercy\u201d and they are defined in the very first sentence of the Holy Father\u2019s letter: \u201cJesus Christ is the face of the Father\u2019s mercy.\u201d The pope\u2019s letter is stunningly beautiful. It\u2019s over 9,000 words long and yet this first sentence seems to be more than enough: \u201cJesus Christ is the face of the Father\u2019s mercy.\u201d Francis could have stopped right there!<\/p> <p>What does it mean to engage and celebrate a year of mercy? Well, we\u2019re about to find out. On Monday, nine of my Jesuit brothers will make themselves available for what we affectionately call the \u201cConfessions Marathon\u201d, when we take our places in the church twice per year to be humbled once again by the holiness of people who approach us so sheepishly, seeking God\u2019s mercy through the sacrament of Reconciliation. They seem so unaware of how much they teach us about mercy and yet these penitents always do more for the priests than we do for them.<\/p> <p>Our website has been loaded with spiritual resources received from the Vatican and the Archdiocese of New York. His Eminence Cardinal Dolan recently sent us a beautiful banner that now hangs in the corridor between our lobby and the Mary Chapel. This thoughtful gift was accompanied by an Advent card wishing all of us a blessed Advent, a happy Christmas, and a year of mercy and grace. Please pray for our Cardinal. He has one of the toughest jobs in the world and is working very hard at it.<\/p> <p>We will continue to share guidance from His Eminence and Pope Francis regarding the Year of Mercy. Also, I have asked our priests and all of our parish ministries to pay special attention to the theme of mercy and how it can be incorporated into homilies, meetings, communications, and activities. Early responses from Family Faith, Bible Study, Music, LGBT Ministries, and others are impressive. We have a year to dive deep and I suggest we maximize it as creatively as we can! Because, as Francis reminds us, \u201cmercy is the very foundation of the Church\u2019s life. All of her pastoral activity should be caught up in the tenderness she makes present to believers; nothing in her preaching and in her witness to the world can be lacking in mercy. The Church\u2019s very credibility is seen in how she shows merciful and compassionate love.\u201d<\/p> <p>But, as we know so well, the effects of God\u2019s mercy will go only as far as our hearts allow. A word so beautiful as mercy will be totally empty unless we choose to forgive, from our hearts, those who have hurt us and who wait to be forgiven. And, lest we be misled, mercy is most certainly a choice that we make with the help of God\u2019s grace. We decide to forgive or we decide to hold on to our anger. This is true for bishops as much as it is for neophytes. So let\u2019s plunge ourselves into the depths of God\u2019s mercy as this most sacred year begins. So much can happen within a year! How can we possibly measure it? Let\u2019s measure it in love\u2026and in mercy!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"In prayers","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GayCatholics\/events\/227404420\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"How Do You Measure A Year?","id":"227404420","time":1450648800000,"updated":1450660961000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348229327000,"name":"Gay Catholics, Christians & Friends - Social Group","group_lon":-74,"id":5035262,"urlname":"GayCatholics","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Gay Catholics & Christians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hoboken ","address_1":"16 Hudson Place","name":"Teak on the Hudson ","lon":-74.028503,"id":23873356,"state":"NJ","lat":40.735794,"repinned":false},"headcount":80,"distance":2.24639821053,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448319241000,"fee":{"amount":30,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This event is now completely sold out for men.

Winter solstice, which takes place in late December, can be a profound way to tune into the magic and beauty of the season. For people throughout the ages\u2014from the ancient Egyptians and Celts to the Hopi\u2014midwinter has been a significant time of ritual, reflection, and renewal. Creating a meaningful celebration of winter solstice, either in place of or in addition to other holiday activities, can help us cultivate a deeper connection to nature and family and all the things that matter most to us. Winter can become a time of feeding the spirit and nurturing the soul, not just emptying our bank account and fraying our nerves.<\/p> <p>Pre-Christmas celebrations While we don\u2019t know how long people have been celebrating the solstice, we know that ancient cultures built huge stone structures designed to align perfectly with the sun at specific times, such as dawn or high noon. And some ancient peoples performed sacred rituals and made offerings when the sun dipped below the horizon to ensure its daily return, especially during the darkest days.<\/p> <p>Many of the traditions now associated with Christmas are believed to have originated centuries earlier with nature-based communities and indigenous peoples. For example, the idea of Santa Claus may have come from the story of the first shamans who were said to climb high into the upper worlds and return with gifts of wisdom and prophecies, postulates Tony Van Renterghem in When Santa Was a Shaman (Llewellyn, 1995). The word \u201cyule\u201d may derive from an Anglo-Saxon term that means \u201cwheel,\u201d and in pagan Scandinavia, village people sat around bonfires of burning yule logs throughout the night while drinking mead and listening to the stories of minstrel-poets.<\/p> <p>Richard Heinberg, author of Celebrate the Solstice: Honoring the Earth\u2019s Seasonal Rhythms through Festival and Ceremony (Quest Books, 1993) describes the solstices as \u201ctimes of danger and opportunity; times for special alertness and aliveness.\u201d In Iran, families often kept fires burning all night to assist the battle between the light and dark forces. In ancient Rome, where it was called Dies Natalis Invicti Solis, or the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, masters even celebrated as equals with their slaves. Throughout history, celebrating the solstice has been a way to renew our connection with each other and with the numinous through acts of goodwill, special rituals, and heightened awareness.\"<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Montclair_Shamanic_Circle\/events\/227407332\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Sunday Night Midwinter Special - Circle of Sharing Gifts, Food, Songs...","id":"227407332","time":1450652400000,"updated":1450664643000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1314900121000,"name":"Montclair Shamanic Circle","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":2424042,"urlname":"Montclair_Shamanic_Circle","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Shamanic Practioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10983","country":"us","city":"Tappan","address_1":"32 Old Tappan Rd","name":"The Tappan Reformed Church's Manse Barn and Grounds","lon":-73.95047,"id":3768222,"state":"NY","lat":41.023743,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.0648078918,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440357418000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/b\/2\/8\/600_445059720.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Join us as we Welcome in the Light in a Joyous Celebration.

Though its title arcs toward grand philosophical inquiry, the stirring power of The Creation of Meaning lies in its intimacy of detail and wry political observation. Shot with a painterly Renaissance beauty in Tuscany\u2019s remote Apennine mountains, where memories of Nazi massacres and partisan resistance remain vivid, the film centers on Pacifico Pieruccioni, an aging but defiant shepherd whose very livelihood and traditions are threatened by a New European reality of Berlusconi-caliber corruption (hilariously evoked in a profanity-laden radio-talk-show rant) and German land speculation.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFor admissions and visitor information\u00a0 click here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/plan\/index#filmticketing<\/a><\/a><br\/>Be advised that MoMA members can now reserve tickets 2 weeks in advance.<br\/>Everybody, members and not, can reserve a ticket online.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf there's interest let's discuss the film over coffee.\u00a0 There are two Starbucks within walking distance.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n<b>IMPORTANT.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order.<\/p> <p>Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings.<\/p> <p>In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<\/p> <p><br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p><br\/>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p><br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p><br\/>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><br\/>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/p> <p><br\/>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart.

Voted one of Vanity Fair\u2019s Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex, Nicole first came to prominence as the leader of the Slow Sex Movement and the innovator of the 15 minute orgasm. Throughout her work, Nicole has expanded the horizons of sexual experience, which has earned her invitations to share the stage as a speaker alongside other luminaries such as Neil Stauss, Tony Robbins, Naomi Wolfe and Esther Perel, as well as inclusion in Tim Ferris\u2019 breakthrough book \u201cThe Four Hour Body.\u201d Nicole brings a no-nonsense, empirical approach to the question most of us ask, \u201cHow do I have a better sex life?\u201d But much more than that, her life has been spent exploring the impact our full human potential in the arena of sex and what benefits that can bring to not just individuals and couples, but to communities, organizations and societies as a whole. What becomes possible for our lives, our health, our happiness, and our prosperity when we learn to live in a continual state of orgasm? This is the territory Nicole continues to explore today.<\/p> <p><br\/>Orgasm is the willingness to sacrifice control in order to access the best and the worst that this existence has to offer. In other words, Orgasm doesn't just create life, Orgasm IS life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\u00a0<\/p> <p>Seating is limited, you must be pre-registered to attend, click this link to claim your spot here on Eventbrite! \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/onetaste-nyc-the-i-om-talks-with-nicole-daedone-registration-19958282761\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/onetaste-nyc-the-i-om-talks-with-nicole-daedone-registration-19958282761\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/onetaste-nyc-the-i-om-talks-with-nicole-daedone-registration-19958282761<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>For more information contact Marissa Ward[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>*Photo credit: Mitch Aidelbaum<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethingstodoinnyc\/events\/226892371\/","yes_rsvp_count":49,"duration":5400000,"name":"The I OM Talks with Nicole Daedone","id":"226892371","time":1450746000000,"updated":1450752121000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1213936546000,"name":"Free NYC!

Voted one of Vanity Fair\u2019s Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex, Nicole first came to prominence as the leader of the Slow Sex Movement and the innovator of the 15 minute orgasm. Throughout her work, Nicole has expanded the horizons of sexual experience, which has earned her invitations to share the stage as a speaker alongside other luminaries such as Neil Stauss, Tony Robbins, Naomi Wolfe and Esther Perel, as well as inclusion in Tim Ferris\u2019 breakthrough book \u201cThe Four Hour Body.\u201d Nicole brings a no-nonsense, empirical approach to the question most of us ask, \u201cHow do I have a better sex life?\u201d But much more than that, her life has been spent exploring the impact our full human potential in the arena of sex and what benefits that can bring to not just individuals and couples, but to communities, organizations and societies as a whole. What becomes possible for our lives, our health, our happiness, and our prosperity when we learn to live in a continual state of orgasm? This is the territory Nicole continues to explore today.<\/p> <p><br\/>Orgasm is the willingness to sacrifice control in order to access the best and the worst that this existence has to offer. In other words, Orgasm doesn't just create life, Orgasm IS life. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * We will most likely have to turn people away so if you are attending in person please register early.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/226905651\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Anime Neon Genesis Evangelon -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlytqbdc","time":1450825200000,"updated":1450837176000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1448135442000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>2016 is around the corner and it\u2019s time for New Year resolutions!

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun.

You will see progress in your writing or creative project with friends and while having fun.\u00a0 After everyone's socialized and had a nice time getting to know each other for about half an hour, the facilitator will lead introductions and possibly discuss personal creative successes such as getting published or overcoming resistance in some small way.\u00a0 <i>No critiquing, exercises, lectures, ego, competition or feeling guilty.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Suggested Donation: \u00a0 $1 to help cover meetup costs.<\/b><\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll have a meetup sign","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Montclair-Friends\/events\/224218384\/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"duration":10800000,"name":"Great tea, coffee, games, unplugged performances, writers, and artists!","id":"pscjhlytqbdc","time":1450830600000,"updated":1450843501000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1245380252000,"name":"Montclair Friends","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":1475728,"urlname":"Montclair-Friends","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Young Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10605","country":"us","city":"White Plains","phone":"914-948-2932","address_1":"252 Bryant Avenue","name":"The LOFT","lon":-73.746014,"id":769965,"state":"NY","lat":41.021411,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.7197265625,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1292971043000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/b\/b\/event_7042203.jpegCome\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/b\/b\/event_7042203.jpegCome<\/a> join your peers from <b>Westchester County<\/b> and the surrounding areas <i>(hello <b>Bronx<\/b>, <b>Connecticut<\/b>, <b>Orange and Putnam Counties<\/b>)<\/i> in a lively, friendly, <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.loftgaycenter.org\/bisexualgroup.html\">facilitated discussion group<\/a><\/b> for men, women, genderqueer, transgender, and not-quite-sure people, as well as people who fall on different places along the monogamous to polyamorous dimension, as long as you inhabit the space between totally straight and totally gay somewhere <i>(i.e., bisexual, bi-curious, questioning, queer, \u201cI don\u2019t label myself,\u201d bi-friendly or some other non-monosexual identity)<\/i>.<\/p> <p>People who wish to understand their bisexual loved ones are also welcome.<\/p> <p>This group is for people over 18.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/225552263\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytqbfc","time":1450915200000,"updated":1450928391000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":22.2845077515,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447801157000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our typical agenda: - We orient new visitors and then chat a bit, as by sharing what's new or good in our lives. - Then we meditate together by chanting mantra followed by the beautiful sounds of the gong - And finally we share thoughts and questions, learning something new sometimes, generally supporting each other best we can.<\/p> <p>Note that we meet <b>every<\/b> Wednesday, 7:00 to 8:30 pm, and <b>every<\/b> Saturday, 2 to 3:30 pm -- <b>except<\/b> for the first Saturday of the month, when we begin our meeting at 5 pm followed by an informal potluck social.

Inside, half of the house is decorated for Christmas; the other half is decorated for Hanukkah.<\/p> <p>We'll\u00a0also see an 800-pound robotic Santa Claus (he sometimes will have a conversation with you!), merry-go-rounds, Nativity scenes, stately trees bejeweled in colorful lights, inflatable figures, enormous wooden soldiers, dancing animals, candy canes, twinkling snowflakes, and much more.<\/p> <p>One interesting house has holiday greetings illuminated in three languages: English, Italian, and Greek.\u00a0On the side of the house,\u00a0a large snowflake design\u00a0periodically lights up as\u00a0a\u00a0Star of David. This house is incredible!<\/p> <p><b>How the Dyker Heights' holiday light tradition\u00a0got started:<\/b><\/p> <p>In the mid-1980s,\u00a0Lucy Spata\u00a0started the tradition of the Christmas Lights. Lucy said, \"when I first moved into the neighborhood, it looked like a funeral parlor during the winter.\" Lucy's neighbors didn't initially welcome\u00a0her \"over-the-top\" holiday lights display. In fact, Lucy said that when one of\u00a0the neighbors complained about the lights and traffic the lights attracted she told them either to join her with holiday decorations or to move out of the neighborhood. However, when another neighbor started to put up the flamboyant holiday lights to match Lucy's lights, this neighborhood tradition\u00a0really took off!<\/p> <p>We'll be finishing at about <b>9:30 PM<\/b>\u00a0near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue.<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll encounter displays that are very bright (like blast or flood lighting), so bring your sunglasses just in case!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/9\/d\/600_444490653.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk.

After we start the walk, we'll have very limited opportunities for a restroom stop because we'll be walking in mostly\u00a0residential neighborhoods.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation:<\/b>\u00a0Take the southbound \"R\" subway train to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.\u00a0After getting off the train, go to the token booth level and make a left turn upstairs. At street level,\u00a0walk east (on the southern side of 86th Street) for about half of a block to the entrances of Century 21 Department Store.<\/p> <p><b>Driving Directions: <\/b>This is a one-way walk, so we will not be going back to the starting point. If you want to take your car, you can park your car somewhere near the \"R\" subway train at 86th Street and 4th Avenue. At the end of the walk, you will have to take the northbound \"D\" subway train at 71st Street to\u00a036th Street and\u00a0then take the connecting southbound\u00a0\"R\" subway train back down to 86th Street and 4th Avenue.<\/p> <p><b>Finishing Time:<\/b>\u00a0This one-way walk will finish at about\u00a0<b>9:30 PM.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Finishing Place:<\/b>\u00a0We'll be finishing near the \"D\" subway station at 71st Street and New Utrecht Avenue. (The \"D\" subway train is the only subway line that runs in Dyker Heights, and it cuts through only one corner of Dyker Heights at 71st Street.) At the end point, you could take the \"D\" subway train, and if you want, you can take the\u00a0northbound \"D\" subway train to Atlantic Avenue, where you can then switch to another subway line.<\/p> <p><b>I\u00a0also had planned to go to a spectacular holiday lights display in the neighborhood of Greenwood, Brooklyn\u00a0but it is unfortunately not happening in 2015.

This is a continuation of the vigil - simple chants such as \"Be still and know I am God\u2026\" with the sound of alchemical crystal bowls (for those who need to lie down and absorb the healing in a deep state of trance and even sleep, we'll have blankets and mats on the floor).<\/p> <p>The midnight ritual - calling on the Cosmic Christ, the presence of that whom we understand in many different ways, whether influenced by our upbringing as well as through our own love and devotion\u2026 This is a sacred hour, a blessed time of Light and Love.<\/p> <p>May this day and night stay within your Soul for the years to come\u2026 Be brave and join our celebration, even if you stop by for an hour or so. We welcome your contribution - members of the community and newcomers alike - bring yourself and your prayers for the world's pending issues. Be Awake, be a Healer\u2026 Become Joy in Christ Light.

Michelin Guide says, \u201cMarseille marries the charm of a classic French bistro with the inimitable style of New York City and the skilled and truly professional kitchen prepares an impressive cuisine bursting with pronounced balanced flavors- Think Casablanca.\u201d Marseille hails from the same restaurant group that owns Caf\u00e9 D\u2019Alsace, Maison, French Roast, Le Monde, Nice Matin, Pigalle and L\u2019Express. Our meal last Christmas was one of the best of the year and consisted of braised lamb shank, roast beef rib eye, heirloom pork, honey glazed duck breast, Christmas turkey, grilled salmon, plus wonderful choices of French appetizers and desserts. Please RSVP early, the restaurant completely sells out every Christmas and this event will have limited seating.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup\/events\/226822509\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"name":"Sold Out Marseille - Christmas Dinner","id":"226822509","time":1451074500000,"updated":1451085957000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431373701000,"name":"Over 45+ New York Dinner Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":18590381,"urlname":"Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"On the ground floor of The Empire State Building \u2022 350 5th Ave at 34th St","name":"Heartland Brewery and Rotisserie","lon":-73.986115,"id":24153386,"state":"NY","lat":40.748333,"repinned":true},"headcount":0,"distance":0.338669866323,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444922573000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>RESERVATIONS HAVE CLOSED.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/a\/8\/600_444580616.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Wine and cocktails are available.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Please multiply the total of your bill by 1.3 to calculate both tax\u00a0<i>and<\/i>\u00a0 tip.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note: Vegetarian and gluten-frees selections are available.\u00a0 <\/b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can take a look at the Drink, Food and Dessert Menus by clicking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heartlandbrewery.com\/empire-state-menu\/\"><b>here<\/b><\/a>. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/e\/d\/600_443068397.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/0\/a\/600_443068426.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/7\/f\/b\/600_445350715.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Reservations are in the name of Meetup.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/60-NYC-young-at-heart\/events\/226081124\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Christmas Day Dinner for our members and friends who can't be with family","id":"226081124","time":1451077200000,"updated":1451096587000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1436619223000,"name":"60+ NYC young at heart","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":18733938,"urlname":"60-NYC-young-at-heart","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":1.25659668446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1450694078000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you don't have any special plans for Christmas, you and your friends should come to the party!
