All of the intricate movements carefully studied and designed by Dr. Pang Ming along with the perceptions of Qi allow us to discipline the mind and body to create healing within ourselves. This harnessing of Qi energy also has external positive healing effects on other human beings, plants, animals, things. Qi seems to interact with the spectrum of all things in creation.<\/p> <p>Please join me throughout the year of 2016 as we continue to build our practice and discover the scientific studies on the Qi of Zhineng Qigong.<\/p> <p>This Friday January 8th 4-6pm we will perform Level 1 at least 2 times. It is a great opportunity for beginners to join in and learn the movements.\u00a0Experienced practitioners are also welcomed to join in and share their experiences.\u00a0All are welcome to experience the benefits of the built up Qi field.<\/p> <p><br\/>The major process: As this group is focused on building the practice of Zhineng Qigong through the act of practicing, we will focus on the perceptions that go along with the movements. We will gradually learn and include the Three Centers Merge into our practice routine. After our Qi field is built up we will sometimes practice LaQi and FaQi.<\/p> <p><br\/>The minor process: Beginning this Friday January 8, we will discuss Dr. Pang's definition of Qi. Throughout the year we will look at the achievements of physicists in describing the structure of the universe and attempt to discover if there is a relationship between their knowledge and the definition of Qi. We will also attempt to discover the relationship of the human mind to Qi. Discussions on these theories will be kept simple and after our repetitions of Level 1 is complete.<\/p> <p>Later in the year as the weather warms we will organize some 'Qigong walk and talk' in nature trails of Bear Mountain and practice Qigong in nature as well!

We prepare ritualistic meals. We gather at the harvest table. We connect with loved ones.\u00a0<\/p> <p>And yet, how many of us are consciously practicing the art of gratitude on a daily basis? How many of us are actively seeking to find the light and joy of gratitude in every person, every relationship, every sharp edge that we meet?<\/p> <p>In an attempt to cultivate gratitude beyond the obligatory, once a year position, I would like to encourage us all to conduct \"The Gratitude Experiment\".\u00a0<\/p> <p>Starting today, until we meet on January 8th, you will be asked to\u00a0hand-write\u00a0a thank you note. Every. Single. Day.\u00a0<\/p> <p>You will tap into gratitude every time you make the conscious choice to stop, reflect, and choose to honor those people and opportunities that are present in your current life. Your ability to benefit from this exercise is directly contingent upon your level of sacred commitment to it's practice.<\/p> <p>This is a tangible practice. This is an art-form. Putting pen to paper is cathartic. It is an extension and an expression of your heart's energy center. So write freely and let the gratitude flow. We will share and discuss the spiritual lessons and personal transformations we experienced during our month-long trial.<\/p> <p>The experiment aims to shift our perception from one of \"I am lacking. I am unlucky. I am down,\" to \"I am blessed. I am grateful. I am enough.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>As I love to quote Marianne Williamson, \"A miracle is simply a shift in perception from fear to love.\" So from my heart to yours, I sincerely hope you will join me in The Gratitude Experiment. Just imagine what miracles may occur when you say \"yes\"!<\/p> <p>With love,<\/p> <p>Brianne<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-White-Elephant-Spirituality-Group-Morris-County-NJ\/events\/227267289\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Gratitude Experiment- Part 2","id":"227267289","time":1452299400000,"updated":1452311589000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388518375000,"name":"The White Elephant Spirituality Group - Morris County NJ","group_lon":-74.4100036621,"id":11642682,"urlname":"The-White-Elephant-Spirituality-Group-Morris-County-NJ","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Elephant Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10314","country":"us","city":"Staten Island","phone":"718-698-1338","address_1":"2329 Victory Blvd","name":"All Saints Episcopal Church","lon":-74.141939,"id":1463623,"state":"NY","lat":40.611709,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.4622678757,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1356557342000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open level class.

At that point will cross UNDER the Henry Hudson Bridge and head east along northernmost Manhattan through the jewel that is Inwood Park until we reach Broadway. At that point we will turn left and make our way across the Broadway Bridge into The Bronx.\u00a0<\/p> <p>After making our way through parts of Kingsbridge and Riverdale, we will veer into historic Van Cortland Park and make our way to the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail.This trail, which lies above the aqueduct which supplied water to NYC beginning in the 19th century, will carry us through many of small towns in Westchester County to our final destination, the Tappan Zee Bridge which had no pedestrian crossing. Along the way, we will have some spectacular views of the Hudson River as well as many historic sights, while having easy accessibility to the Metro North.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will have one full fledged break to eat as well as some shorter bathroom stops. We'll walk at a brisk pace. For those unsure as to whether you can do this, get your a** out there. The energy and encouragement will enable you to cover distances you didn't think were possible. Just read the comments from the previous two hikes. This is a great chance to test yourself mentally and physically while discovering new parts of NYC and the surrounding area. Look forward to seeing you all.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere will be 2-3 minute water breaks about every hour and a lunch break at about the halfway point. We had a nearly 80% completion rate for the 36 miler, so if you come with your legs, heart, and mental commitment you should be able to finish and be rewarded with a very fulfilling experience.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n-----------------------------------<\/p> <p>NOTE: You are responsible for bringing appropriate gear, supplies, clothing, first aid, and lights.

Please wear a watch so that you know when to turn around.<\/p> <p><b>Water\/Bag Storage:<\/b> There are very few water fountains along the route, so bring a water bottle if you need one while running.

One moment you swoop upward as Lawson relates her attempts to hold a koala in Australia while wearing a koala costume and explains her quirky love for taxidermied animals (who must be dead from natural causes only), and you\u2019re giggling like a three-year-old. Then your stomach drops like an artillery shell when Lawson exposes the dark side of her mental illnesses: trying not to cut herself and holing up in her bedroom for days on end. The ups and downs make this a difficult book to read all in one go. However, Lawson uses both her hilarious and heartbreaking episodes to camouflage so many life lessons and biting observations. (A poignant example: when cancer victims don\u2019t respond to medication, no one blames the cancer victim; people with mental illness don\u2019t get the same respect.) This is a book you\u2019ll want to savor. Whether or not you too suffer from depression, you\u2019ll turn the last page fired up by Lawson\u2019s conviction that you can be furiously happy no matter what life hurls at you.<\/p> <p>--Adrian Liang<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"60 Beans located on corner of Ditmars Blvd & 36th Street.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Astoria-Personal-Development-Meetup\/events\/227516485\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Book Club: Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson","id":"227516485","time":1452349800000,"updated":1452361636000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449189953000,"name":"Astoria Self Development Book Club","group_lon":-73.9100036621,"id":19179772,"urlname":"Astoria-Personal-Development-Meetup","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Conscious Rockstars"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"632 Broadway","name":"Solar Film\/Video Productions","lon":-73.996025,"id":12242342,"state":"NY","lat":40.726166,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.68011593819,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449599923000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to make a film in 5 days?

Raising a bilingual child is not easy but along with a committed community it makes it fun and enjoyable. It has been a pleasure to organizing this group and planning fun community events and educational playdates where our little ones and families have great chances to interact and have an awesome time together.<\/p> <p>Right now, the meetup.com membership fee for this group is due. It's $86 for 6 months. It would be nice and very helpful if we could all pitch in to help pay it- since I already organize and run the group and post the events....It would be wonderful if everyone can help pay the fee by making a small, fractional, suggested donation. I have covered the fee for an entire year and it would really help to have members contribute and participate in the activities<\/p> <p>Suggested Membership Fee: $10 per family bi-annually ... If you would like to pay by paypal, I would recommend that you send me a personal gift payment on paypal.com- this way you won't be charged any fees and the total money will go to the group instead of paypal. (I will send you my paypal account through private message) You may also just click on the link on the left side bar where it says chip in, (but you will be charged a small fee).<\/p> <p>Any money that is left over after I make the payment to meetup.com will go towards a party for our group! Doesn't that sound like fun? I would like this group to grow and for us all and our kids to make lasting connections and get lot's of information about our neighborhoods and resources to make our lives easier.

Spirit and health are in the mix, as we learn the connectedness of all things. This course will teach you to garden with the materials at hand: to raise abundant food, herbs, and craft materials and to improve the dynamic life level of your surrounding environment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Become more financially and ecologically balanced - learn to be a smarter consumer and what real economy means. Understand how cooperation is as important as (our cultural bias towards) competition \u00a0 Permaculture operates on all levels and scales. Don't just learn the right answer, learn what questions we should be asking.<\/p> <p>Traditional knowledge and modern culture are combined in this unique whole systems approach that originated in Australia in the 1970's. Climate change and social upheaval are upon us, as predicted by permaculture's co-founder, Bill Mollison. Learn how to move toward positive change in the world we create together - Permaculture can be paired with many livelihoods and practices to increase benefits and create abundance.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

But the media don't give LP candidates a chance. That's why we campaign from within. Within the two-party system, every one of our ideas can be adopted. (That's the history of the Progressive movement, incidentally). The system is so stacked against the LP that it's akin to shouting under water. In 2012, you couldn't ask for a better candidate for president than Gary Johnson. But he got 1% of the vote. LP has been around for 40 years and never has won a Congressional seat, Senate seat, or Governorship. The majority of LP members in state legislatures were elected when there was no Republican opponent or no Democrat opponent. Until the two-party \"system\" is splintered, there is little hope for LP's electoral success. The closeness of the two big parties further dilutes LP prospects, because in any close election, a vote for the LP candidate is perceived as \"throwing your vote away\", or worse \"helping elect the scoundrel\". Campaigning within the Republican or Democrat party is a better route to the electoral success of freedom. Campaigning within an established party allows us to shed better light on the how the incumbent leaders of the party disserve us.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If a Resistance Candidate CAN'T be president, who would you choose?<\/b><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>An outsider committed to Jeffersonian principles would be best. Right now (May, 2015) I'd like to see the two who have not held elected office, Ms. Fiorina and Dr. Carson, team up. Let them pledge to one another and to the primary voters that they are running as an inseparable team in primary states that award their delegates proportionately. In those states, the voters will decide who between them will take the VP and who will take the President slot. In winner-take-all primaries, one will stay off the ballot, but voters would know they are voting for the pair. The Outsiders would be for example \"Fiorina-Carson\" in some winner-take all states, and \"Carson-Fiorina\" in other winner-take-all states. It keeps them from diluting their campaign expenditures. If Gary Johnson ran as a Republican or a Democrat, he'd have my allegiance. He's the best candidate since Goldwater (Harry Browne, Steve Forbes, Duncan Hunter, and Ronald Reagan round out the top five in my life-time).\u00a0 Scheindlin-Napolitano would be good, and fun to watch.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Wouldn't a Resistance candidate, if elected as a Democrat or Republican. get co-opted?

I don't think a single Resistance candidate is driven toward public service by the possible riches. So big industry is going to have a hard time co-opting any of us. And at least some Resistance Candidates are committed to \"wearing a wire\", that reveals any attempts to suborn the official. But in case a Resistance member isn't serving the principles on which he campaigned, throw him out in 2 years.

I've been working with guys since 2013 to help them build confidence, overcome their limitations and achieve concrete results in their dating and love life.<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/53802042\/dsc3745copy28229-1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>My clients are smart, successful guys who are looking to become the best version of themselves. They want to become more attractive to women while maximizing their potential in all areas of life, from career and social skills all the way to fitness and health.<\/p> <p>Justin, you been a great help! I just wanted to take the chance to thank you for the effort your part to put together such a well-designed, progressive and honest program.\u00a0\u2013Kaye<\/p> <p>As a coach and consultant, my teachings are based on my lived experience as a guy who went from being clueless with girls and weighed down with social anxiety, to getting dates and relationships with awesome women consistently.<\/p> <p>I don't brag, but I currently live a life that most men will only dream about.<\/p> <p>I'm not a super handsome guy. Nor am I tall, jacked or rich. My results are 100% from hard work on myself, bringing out the best in my personality, and learning how to communicate with the opposite sex.<\/p> <p>Everything that I teach revolves around three key concepts:\u00a0Simplicity, Realism and Results<\/p> <p>I prefer to keep things\u00a0Simple\u00a0in dating (life is complicated enough as it is).<\/p> <p>Realism\u00a0means we put a limit on theory and esoteric musings, and always bring things back to the reality of what actually happens out there with women and dating.<\/p> <p>And\u00a0Results\u00a0are what we are ultimately after, so anything that does not deliver results is thrown out.<\/p> <p>Justin\u2019s advice makes a lot of sense. He\u2019s interested in pushing you out of your comfort zone but always acknowledges who you are as an individual and who you want to be as a man. He\u2019s down-to-earth and full of practical suggestions to help you attain your goals, but will never tell you your standards are too high or your expectations unrealistic.\u00a0\u2013Jeff, Brooklyn, NY<\/p> <p><b>What's Included in this Seminar?<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/53802042\/photo3copy-1.png\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>1.

My Website<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/<\/a> Vortex Healing\u00ae is a energy therapy modality that works with divine healing energy and divine consciousness that is channeled through my being into the client. When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality.

A planet promising to reveal the truth about our place in the cosmos, untainted by overpopulation, pollution, and war. Ren believed in that vision enough to give up everything to follow Suh-Mi into the unknown.<\/p> <p>More than twenty-two years have passed since Ren and the rest of the faithful braved the starry abyss and established a colony at the base of an enigmatic alien structure where Suh-Mi has since resided, alone. All that time, Ren has worked hard as the colony's 3-D printer engineer, creating the tools necessary for human survival in an alien environment, and harboring a devastating secret.<\/p> <p>Ren continues to perpetuate the lie forming the foundation of the colony for the good of her fellow colonists, despite the personal cost.

Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

This telecourse is taught by two distinguished doctors: Dr. Pat Love, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and relationship consultant, and Dr. Jon Carlson, a university professor and Psychologist. Both instructors are practicing clinicians and have authored books and articles that have attracted national recognition. They challenge students to confront assumptions on the nature of love and to critically analyze the ideals perpetuated by popular culture in order to realize the wisdom it takes to find lasting love.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/c\/f\/600_434053775.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/0\/c\/600_434053836.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/c\/7\/600_434053511.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/e\/a\/600_435681738.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/2\/d\/600_434219693.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Suggestions:<\/p> <p>A.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The Elastic Band is David Sidman on guitar and percussion, Ross Harriss on guitar and sax, and Michael Gorin on fiddle.<\/p> <p>Come dance to a live caller and band with Country Dance New York. We are an intergenerational, multiethnic, smoke and alcohol free, inclusive community with one thing in common: we love to contra and English country dance! Contra dance is a high energy American folk dance accompanied by live string music and taught by a caller. No partner or experience required. All dances are taught in advance and the figures are easy to learn.<\/p> <p>Please bring a pair of clean, soft soled shoes {no spike heels} to dance in, and a water bottle. We ask that you not use strongly scented grooming products as the smell can become overwhelming on the dance floor when things start to heat up. Country Dance New York has been hosting contra dances most Saturdays, and English country dancing most Tuesdays, at Church of the Village for almost 70 years. COV is located at 201 W. 13 St., on the northwest corner of 7th Avenue. Beginners' session on Saturdays {for contra} is from 7:30 to 8:00. Dancing for all from 8:00 until 10:45. Hang out with us at a local diner after the dance.<\/p> <p>Beginner's session on Tuesdays {for ECD} is from 7:00 to 7:30. Dancing for all from 7:30 to 10:30.<\/p> <p>Cost: $15 for general public; $12 members and for full time students with ID. Be sure to tell the people at the door if this is your first time dancing with us. They will give you a free pass to return as our guest!<\/p> <p>To see what contra dancing looks like, click here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mM5vNzFxxBs\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mM5vNzFxxBs<\/a> To see what English country dancing looks like, click here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rB40AvJnMUY\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rB40AvJnMUY<\/a> Join us on Facebook: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/2449906414\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/2449906414\/<\/a><\/p> <p>For a complete schedule of our upcoming season, and for more information, visit our website.<\/p> <p>See you on the dance floor!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-cdny-org\/events\/227780115\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Contra Dance with Alex Deis-Lauby and David Sidman's Elastic Band!","id":"227780115","time":1452385800000,"updated":1452397234000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389322725000,"name":"Country Dance New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":11984702,"urlname":"www-cdny-org","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Contra & English country dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"108 W. 40th St. (btwn 6th Ave & Broadway)","name":"Croton Lounge (Newly Renovated!)","lon":-73.985611,"id":23564130,"state":"NY","lat":40.753735,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.345946401358,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452034735000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/f\/9\/600_443957657.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>West Coast Swing is a contemporary form of swing dancing that's becoming very popular &amp; can be danced to any kind of music!\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Dancing is a great way to meet people!

Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same music as you. If you need to leave at any point, just hand your headphones into any staff member.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Awesome-Things-to-Do\/events\/227484495\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Underground Party \u2013 Subway Tour!","id":"227484495","time":1452387600000,"updated":1452399721000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1160883321000,"name":"Awesome Things to Do","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":344877,"urlname":"Awesome-Things-to-Do","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Awesome Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Port Chester","address_1":"29 North Main Street","name":"The Copacabana Steakhouse  ","lon":-73.66272,"id":24274777,"state":"NY","lat":41.000957,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":24.4011707306,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451502453000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>The Copa is located in the heart of the fast-growing village of Port Chester.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/9\/b\/600_445481627.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 The House DJ will be playing a wide variety of Dance music for us.<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/9\/f\/600_445481631.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>This will be a Multi-Group Meetup Event<\/b><\/p> <p><b>So expect a lively mix of members from<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Westchester, Putnam and Western CT including\u00a0 Greenwich and Stamford.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>There is Free Parking behind the Copa at the Abendroth Ave municipal parking lot.

The first is an older woman who offers sage advice and sorely needed comfort; the second, a maladjusted student, is not quite so helpful. A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work. But her real work is this: In order to emerge from grief and the past, she has to learn how to make her own happiness. In order to really see people, she has to look within her heart.
