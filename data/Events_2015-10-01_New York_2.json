Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/225147885\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Sunday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"225147885","time":1441576800000,"updated":1441589830000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":6.94302940369,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427042046000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/3\/7\/600_436236151.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Let's take our practice outside this Sunday in Fort Lee Historic Park! \u00a0Our lovely scenic lawn is waiting for us!

We like to think of it as a kind of spiritual singalong, and who doesn't like a singalong? We use several easy-to-learn and different Sanskrit texts and leave it to members to choose a chant they'd like the group to use on a particular evening. If you have never chanted before, come along and try out this wonderful spiritual tool. It doesn't matter if it seems strange to you--the point is precisely to buck oneself out of a sense of 'ordinary' life--or if you think you are completely atonal. You will probably derive a lot of benefit from doing chant, and it can lastingly help you forward in life.<\/p> <p>After the chanting ends, we immediately go into silent meditation for 20-25 minutes. Whereas chant tends to focus and energize the body and mind, silent meditation tends to quiet and calm the mind. It's a perfect counterpoint to the chanting.<\/p> <p>As you can see, then, the Sunday evening meetings are a kind of dual spiritual exercise: of energizing and focusing the mind (chant) and then relaxing and calming it (meditation).<\/p> <p>Come along to this or our other meetings if you feel you'd like to live a happier, calmer life and be able to live fearlessly through the cares and worries of modern life. If you can find a way to slow down and live more mindfully, you are well on the way to being an agent of joy and serenity in your own life and the lives of those living around you.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"A or 1 Trains to 190th Street, south entrance to the church.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

Currently based in New York, he focuses on issues reporting and political news, also traveling throughout the United States and beyond to reflect on the events that shape our lives. Working not only as a photographer, but as a photo editor and Assistant Director of Photographer at the Cincinnati Enquirer, and as freelance photo editor at Newsweek, Mr. Ruttle has a broad understanding of the needs of today's photojournalist as well as the editors he works with. Starting a career at a time when the working medium was mostly black and white film, he embraced digital technologies in the late 1990's and guided other staff photographers (while staying in contact with camera providers and manufacturers) as the transition from film to digital imaging took place. Assignments have taken him from the small towns of New York State and the Midwest, to coverage of a shattering earthquake in Haiti, a tsunami in South Asia and a still evolving refugee migration along the Syrian border in Turkey. Craig currently works with The Associated Press, Newsday, various other newspapers, magazines, and websites, along with an affiliation as a stock contributor to Redux Pictures, working to create self-assigned, expanded stories that transcend daily news coverage.\u00a0\u279f\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FCraigRuttle.com%2F&amp;h=aAQEbo0_g&amp;enc=AZMi_OZJuTEat_vGwC7TyRKFoGs0LshOdAsIzCNhNeBjpWpw5B1raP2QWntzk7Yjpd0&amp;s=1\">CraigRuttle.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Chad Rachman is a staff photographer for the New York Post and for Getty Images.

Manhattan. Monday, September 7th @ 2:30PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend for what perhaps may be the last trip of the season!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site. Please attach a picture if you don\u2019t have a page on a social networking site.<\/p> <p>Q) How old are you?<\/p> <p>Q) Where did you attend school?<\/p> <p>Q) Will you please tell us a little bit about yourself?<\/p> <p>FOR SAILOR APPLICANTS<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you crewed on, but not captained, a sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you captained a sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you crewed on but not captained, a non-sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you captained, a non-sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) Will you tell us a little bit about your sailing experience?<\/p> <p><br\/>Please copy and paste all questions and answers and send in an email to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Thank you!<\/p> <p><br\/>FAQ<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do you have to pay to attend a boat party?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: No, all boat parties are absolutely free.\u00a0 You may want to bring food and drinks, which are on a potluck basis.<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: The specific location is not listed.\u00a0 Where do we meet for the boat party?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Unfortunately, we cannot fit everyone who RSVPs to a MeetUp event onto the boat.\u00a0 There are some crew members and attendees who are not part of the MeetUp group, so there may be less space than it appears.\u00a0 In order to avoid miscommunication and needing to leave people on the dock, specific details (including meeting location) are sent to members individually.\u00a0 If you do not receive an invitation via email, you will not be able to attend that week\u2019s boat party.<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: How often are the boat parties?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Boat parties are generally every weekend, either on a Saturday or Sunday. They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes! Please fill out the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible.\u00a0 If you are uncomfortable posting any of the information on your profile, please email your responses to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.\u00a0 Without a complete application, you will not be considered to receive an invitation.\u00a0 The trips last several hours, so we will have 20-30 people in a confined space for an extended period of time. Therefore, we need to have an idea of who we are inviting on the boat and ensure that we have a proper crew.\u00a0 Please fill out the questionnaire if you are interested in sailing with Gotham Yacht Club.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail\/events\/225092471\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Monday Social Sail: Last Trip of the Season!","id":"225092471","time":1441650600000,"updated":1441663351000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434554860000,"name":"Gotham Yacht Club: Social Sail","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18679654,"urlname":"Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sailors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"580 Madison Avenue","name":"Sony Atrium (Just Inside the North Entrance at 56th Street)","lon":-73.973053,"id":21583002,"state":"NY","lat":40.762108,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":17,"distance":1.22162401676,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440776538000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Okay gang.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/224383756\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Master of the Rose Cross: Aum, Om, and Amen","id":"fpbtflytmbkb","time":1441665000000,"updated":1441677451000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"257 West 39th Street between 7-8 Ave. 212 307 7707","name":"Champion Studios ,14th Floor","lon":-74.005943,"id":24074722,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439079778000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>These Psychic Development and Spirit contact classes are created for people who are passionate committed and sincere about developing their Intuition, Psychic abilities and contact with Spirit.<\/p> <p>If you have always believed you are psychic, or have seen and felt Spirit during your life, or you feel compelled to explore this part of yourself- you will love this class.

Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other.

When she arrived in America, in 1939, to star in a remake of her 1936 Swedish film <i>Intermezzo<\/i>, the producer David O. Selznick recognized in the 24-year-old a new freshness and accessibility\u2014a radical break with the artificially elaborate notions of \u201cglamor\u201d that had been synonymous with female stars in Hollywood since the late silent era. In films like <i>Casablanca<\/i> (1942), <i>Gaslight<\/i> (1944) and <i>Notorious<\/i> (1946), Bergman seemed to speak directly to her public, cutting through melodramatic conventions.<\/p> <p>Bergman\u2019s search for authenticity eventually led to Italy, where she made five features with the pioneering Neorealist director Roberto Rossellini, a body of work now recognized as one of the foundations of modern cinema. After her relationship with Rossellini ended, Bergman continued to work with some of the medium\u2019s most creative filmmakers. Her last theatrical film, Ingmar Bergman\u2019s <i>Autumn Sonata<\/i> (1978), brought her back to her native Sweden.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b> <b>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/d\/f\/600_440370431.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>1941. USA. Directed by Victor Fleming. Screenplay by John Lee Mahin, Samuel Hoffenstein, from the novella by Robert Louis Stevenson. With Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, Lana Turner, Donald Crisp. Victor Fleming\u2019s elaborate MGM adaptation of the Stevenson story has a distinctly Freudian tone, with Spencer Tracy\u2019s repressed Victorian doctor discovering the thrill of unbridled sexuality (as kinky as the censors would allow) as he changes into the louche Mr. Hyde. Bergman plays the saucy barmaid who is brutalized into becoming Hyde\u2019s mistress, while the good doctor remains loyal to his aristocratic fianc\u00e9e, played by a prim Lana Turner.

Ignore the note on this page, which says, \"Max: 1 person\". We never max out room capacity. The reason it says it's maxed out, is because I can't sign you up through meetup.com. To RSVP, please send an email to alfred dot vachris at gmail dot com, with your first and last name. Then you will receive an email once a month. A photo ID is mandatory. We plan on meeting on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, but there are changes occasionally. You should receive an email, if there's a cancellation. The Conference Center's security department, requires your first and last name, so please include your full name, within the body of your email. Sometimes, the map on this meetup link above, is incorrect, so please write down the address, (at 41st Street and 8th Avenue, NorthEast corner... i.e. not in Port Authority). If you don't get an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request. I always learn something new at the group, like an advanced feature, or a glitch\/bug to beware of. For example, did you know that formulas entered in the Named Range box calculate as \"Array Entered\". It's OK, to arrive half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 6pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

With proficiency in R and Python, Luke is primed to be a major asset to any analytic force.<\/p> <p>Xavier Capdepon (MSc Urban Engineering &amp; Master in Corporate Finance)<br\/>Xavier has more than 12 years experience in analytical modeling. In a career ranging from transportation research to insurance securitization trading and esoteric securities banking, Xavier has deep roots in Data Science. From C and VBA, to SQL, R and Python, Xavier believes in knowing the best-in-breed toolkits. An experienced instructor and consultant in the field of finance, Xavier continues to deepen his abiding interest in prediction through taking the ASA\/CAS actuarial exams (first two completed) and experimenting with machine learning models using Hadoop and Spark.\u00a0Previously at Guggenheim Partners, he is currently a Fellow at the NYC Data Science Academy.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Agenda\/Content:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Demonstration of a Shiny App for building strategy from technical indicators and visualizing the return.\u00a0In this Shiny App, Luke implemented a trading strategy generated by Bollinger Band, visualized the return and eventually modified the strategy by MACD.\u00a0Bollinger Band is an elementary volatility indicator and the strategy is generated based on the belief that the price bounce back whenever it hits the edge of Bollinger Band. This is an one of the simplest strategies and personally I believe it reflects humans' most naive feeling about the stock prices.\u00a0The visualization builds up the connection between the market data and our strategy, because we can actually see how market react to it. Once the return can be seen, it is straightforward to understand why a strategy fail in certain period. In our case, we see that strategy fails when the trend price is very strong--which makes sense because when trend is strong the assumption that the price bounce back is no longer valid. Here we need to impose another popular indicator, MACD.\u00a0MACD reveals momentum of the price change. The backend algorithm basically suspends buying signal from Bollinger Band and encourages selling to stop loss when MACD shows very negative momentum. It does the opposite when MACD indicates positive momentum. This simple modification reduce the risk or improve the return in several different stocks.The importance of his method lies in the fact that concept behind the modification is simple and the math I used is basic yet the improvement is obvious. This suggests to a reasonable extent our trading result can be improved with better tool and understanding.<\/p> <p>Demonstration of a Shiny App for processing subways traveling time calculations and visualizing the subways movements in real time using a Python script.<br\/>In his Shiny app, Xavier explored the MTA data by redrawing a map of New York using the paths of both buses and subways, implemented a script to compare and visualize the travel times of the lines 4 Express train and 1 local train from the bronx to lower manhattan and to create a real time map of the 1 train.<br\/>The idea for the app is based on a comment from his sister in law who mentionned several times that, in her experience, the subways, 1 local trains and 4 express trains, were not running with the same punctuality from the Bronx to Lower Manhattan during the early morning peak. In order to investigate, Xavier used the static and real time data available on the MTA.info website.<br\/>At first, in an attempt to make sense of the numerous files and data available, he used the data to redraw the map of new york city using the paths used every day by the buses and the subways. The visualization is a map with a particularity: the transparency of the drawing package ggplot2 allows to highlight the streets used by several bus lines around new york city.Then, Xavier wrote a script to gather the data and calculate the travel time for the 1 and 4 trains from the Bronx to lower Manhattan given a depart time along the day. The visualization some trends over the day with two peaks at rush hours and lower difference in travel time between the 1 and 4 trains than expected.<br\/>Finally, using the work described previously, the Shiny app also presents a real time map of the 1 train using real time data gathered every 10 second from the MTA API using Python script.<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/>Reference:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Visualization of Trading Strategy backtesting\u00a0<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>blogpost:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/visualization-strategy-back-testing\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/visualization-strategy-back-testing\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/visualization-strategy-back-testing\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>App:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Luke\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Luke\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/216.230.228.88\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Luke\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Redrawing NY City Map using Public Transportation Data<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>blogpost: <a href=\"http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/fastest-subway-in-nyc\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/fastest-subway-in-nyc\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nycdatascience.com\/fastest-subway-in-nyc\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>App:<a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Xavier\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Xavier\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/216.230.228.88:3838\/Bootcamp2-Project\/Shiny-Project\/Xavier\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we are on 19th floor.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Open-Data\/events\/225011754\/","yes_rsvp_count":79,"duration":9000000,"name":"R Shiny demo: Trading Strategy backtesting and Find Fastest subway in NYC","id":"225011754","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441896080000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369362644000,"name":"NYC Open Data","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":8619412,"urlname":"NYC-Open-Data","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Data Scientists and Open Data-er"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441217452000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join NYC's hottest fashionistas for this special Pre-Fashion Week Rooftop Mixer!

Your expert guide will point out defunct legendary clubs like Cafe Society, where Billie Holiday made her downtown debut; and other long gone clubs like Sweet Basil's, The Village Gate, and the hard-bopping Cafe Bohemia where Charles Mingus, Art Blakey and Miles Davis chose to introduce their latest compositions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Date: September 8th\u00a0<br\/>Time: 6:30 PM\u00a0<br\/>Price: $100 \/ Person\u00a0<br\/>Tickets:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/2zh1jZ\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/2zh1jZ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/goo.gl\/2zh1jZ<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/e\/5\/600_441695813.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/f\/3\/600_441695827.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/funthingstodoinnyctoday\/events\/225168413\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Greenwich Village Jazz Crawl","id":"225168413","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441764795000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1217100557000,"name":"Alternative to the Bar Fun Things To Do In NYC Today!","group_lon":-74,"id":1235637,"urlname":"funthingstodoinnyctoday","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"NYers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10607","country":"us","city":"White Plains","address_1":"5 Prospect Ave","name":"Boxing Westchester","lon":-73.79068,"id":11543732,"state":"NY","lat":41.040035,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.6280727386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432845215000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you love the art of boxing and live in Westchester, then there is really only one place to be.<\/p> <p>Boxing914 is an excellent program designed to teach the skills of western boxing.<br\/>Learn from master coaches who have decades of experience.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.boxing914.com\">www.boxing914.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are located within Belmars gym at 5 Prospect Ave, White Plains, 10607","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boxingwhiteplainswestchester\/events\/225069634\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Free Boxing for Beginners Session","id":"jfkjhlytmblb","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441764774000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1359863174000,"name":"Boxing Westchester","group_lon":-73.8099975586,"id":7000932,"urlname":"boxingwhiteplainswestchester","group_lat":41.0400009155,"who":"Champ"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":" 212-677-8621","address_1":"123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th & 13th streets)","name":"CRS (Center for Remembering & Sharing)","lon":-73.989868,"id":346140,"state":"NY","lat":40.733528,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":1.14061510563,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1398203004000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Given by Yasuko Kasaki<br\/>Tuesdays from 6:30 \u2013 7 pm<br\/>Free<\/p> <p>Please join us in the sharing of miracles. Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't open our door from 6:30 - 7 pm while meditation is in progress. Kindly refrain from ringing our buzzer during this time.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/224750594\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytmblb","time":1441751400000,"updated":1441764723000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":3.61738729477,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439767917000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>3-4 budding developer pairs from our web development immersive class will present for 5-10 minutes on a technical topic of their choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>This meetup is a great opportunity for prospective students to visit the school, meet current students and teachers, and catch a glimpse of The Flatiron School experience.

\"The Musical Enneagram\" - some details on this series are listed below.\u00a0 We'll also have a mini-reading (this month only), showcasing a few sample short pieces of fictional writing from the breakout group (Douglas, Tom, Nicholas), who have been meeting in recent months to explore fiction-writing specifically from the point-of-view of given Enneagram types.<\/p> <p>Please consider coming out joining us.\u00a0 This meeting will be a unique opportunity to help shape our next series, as well as catching up on recent activities.<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Nicholas (Organizer)<\/p> <p><b>New Series: The Musical Enneagram<\/b><\/p> <p>Exploring the musical expressions of each of the types of the Enneagram can be a fascinating exercise that may add breadth and color to our understanding of the nature of the types.\u00a0 While it is certainly not simple or easy to say that a given composer's music clearly exhibits type-specific attributes, it turns out that some interesting generalizations based on the creator's type seem just possible. \u00a0With considerably less of a stretch, it is certainly also fair game to listen into music, given knowledge of the creator's type, and to discern new meanings, or at least new interpretations of the music, using that knowledge.<\/p> <p>The goal of this series will be to assemble a medley of great music created by - or at least somehow representative of (see more below) - each of the types of the Enneagram.\u00a0 I (Nicholas, Organizer) have spent a good deal of time over the past year making a start at such a medley.\u00a0 I do not claim that my selections represent a cross-section of music in its totality - my choices naturally begin with personal favorites of mine - but I've tried to expand these into a broadly representative spectrum of historically-important music of many genres, created by individuals for whom I have pretty good type diagnosis, and have also included specific pieces that capture - as nearly as anything I could find - something of the essence of each Enneagram Type.<\/p> <p>Given the breadth of the topic area, a medley like this can never really be considered finished.\u00a0 In the series I have in mind, I'll present something of what I've collected, but it will also be your turn to participate and to add some more music as well. \u00a0We'll discuss to get to some clarity on typing musical creators according to the Enneagram, and also to looking at music itself through an Enneagram lens, which may be necessary if we don't have enough information to be sure about the creator's type (or, if there are many creators, or very strong cultural factors at work, etc.)<\/p> <p>How can a piece of music \"express\" the attribute of an Ennegram type?\u00a0 There are many possible ways - perhaps the most obvious (and the most trivial) is the lyrics included in many songs and other musical forms.\u00a0 Think for example of the penchant of Type Two for idealizing one's experience of important one-to-one personal relationships or hoped-for relationships - and the innumerable pop songs that express similar sentiments.\u00a0 (\"All of My Love,\" \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life,\" \u00a0\"I Just Want to be Your Everything,\" ....)<\/p> <p>To go a bit deeper, we might also inquire into the \"texture\" of a given piece of music - do the harmonies, the orchestration, the basic structure of the musical elements capture something of the composer's emotional \"tone\"?\u00a0 Clearly, there will be significant issues of interpretation involved, but perhaps we can (mostly?) agree on some things after some immersion in the topic and some listening together.<\/p> <p>Lastly, in those cases when we really *know* the type of the ultimate creator, we may be able to interpret a little deeper or differently than if we didn't have this knowledge.\u00a0 Looking into a composer's biographies adds somehow to our experience of the music.\u00a0 Just what or how may be difficult to say, but we will do our best to explore together the specific effect of knowing the composer's Enneagram type.<\/p> <p>No specific preparation is asked for the September organization meeting that will begin this series.\u00a0 We'll just do some planning - possibly listen to a few sample tracks of the collection I've already gathered - and discuss how group members can best contribute.\u00a0 Please feel free to consider in advance the various genres, sub-genres and specific pieces of music you enjoy, and how examples within each might relate to its creators' type(s), if you know them.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/enneagram-4\/events\/221598006\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Org Meeting for Music Series + Mini-Reading","id":"qxnrkfytmbcb","time":1441753200000,"updated":1441766359000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1066858789000,"name":"The New York Enneagram of Personality Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":54474,"urlname":"enneagram-4","group_lat":40.75,"who":"People Interested in Enneagram"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14198327065,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441041119000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/3\/a\/600_441508474.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Let's meet up in NYC!\u00a0 And create a beautiful painting together -

Not in the quality of our readers -- we daresay that's too high a bar to set -- but in our venue and our media.<\/p> <p>To begin with, we are now settled in at our fabulous new venue, the Brooklyn Commons Cafe. The Commons holds many more people than we could before, and serves serves gourmet coffees, teas, beers both draft and bottled and good natural wine by the glass, as well as six sandwiches (portabello, mozzarella, smoked salmon, smoked whitefish, fava bean puree with olive tapenade, salami) and a couple salads (avocado, mixed greens). Plus empanadas, nuts, pastries... So the traditional event of going out with the writers after the reading will be on-site!<\/p> <p>And if you caught our three readings in April and early May, you will know that we are now streaming these events live via Livestream, where they will remain archived for a period of time. (Right now you can still catch those events by going to Livestream.com and searching for NYRSF.) This is largely made possible by the facilities at the Commons, including three robotic cameras and wireless mics -- and the professional skills of Terence Taylor, sf\/f writer and video producer. The result: Nothing less than a fully professional webcast. (Note: This doesn't let you off the hook from attending live if you're within 100 miles of the event, of course...)<\/p> <p>Add to that the fact that we are beginning our 25th Season! We have great wonders for you this year -- but with this expansion come an expansion of our costs. Our price remains the same -- FREE! -- and our suggested donation policy of $7 remains. But we need to work much harder to hustle donations, both on-site and off. So this December, look our for our first Kickstarter campaign and think good thoughts about donating (and perhaps snagging a holiday gift for a loved one. This will not only shore up the losses we take most every event, but will allow us to pay our rent, provide a (nice) stipend to the talent and staff, and perhaps even to fly a special guest now and then. Details forthcoming.<\/p> <p>And what better way to start the season with two wonderful writers -- one established and the other a new talent with his second novel.<\/p> <p>---<br\/>Rajan Khanna is an author, blogger, reviewer and narrator.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Why does this happen? How do you stop it? How do you turn it around?<br\/>3. How to tell when a man is attracted to you in the most important ways. When does he have feelings for you?

Nicknamed the Wolfpack, the brothers spend their childhood re-enacting their favorite films using elaborate homemade props and costumes. With no friends and living on welfare, they feed their curiosity, creativity, and imagination with film, which allows them to escape from their feelings of isolation and loneliness. Everything changes when one of the brothers escapes, and the power dynamics in the house are transformed.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/224862791\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytmbmb","time":1441839600000,"updated":1441901676000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"230 Thompson St","name":"The Uncommons","lon":-73.998795,"id":24007750,"lat":40.729465,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":1.49474644661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439696666000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/8\/d\/600_440564941.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Like Uncle Ted said,\u00a0boardgames night\u00a0Wednesdays!

With no friends and living on welfare, they feed their curiosity, creativity, and imagination with film, which allows them to escape from their feelings of isolation and loneliness. Everything changes when one of the brothers escapes, and the power dynamics in the house are transformed.

When you graduate, you will be stronger, more flexible and more adaptable to the impact of running. And, you\u2019ll do it very gradually under the close eye of an experienced, professional, certified running coach.\u00a0<\/p> <p>--------------<br\/><i>Read more about your coach's philosophy, rationale and approach by following this link:<\/i>\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/iyzQp1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/iyzQp1\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/goo.gl\/iyzQp1<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/>--------------<\/p> <p>This workshop series should have minimal impact on any race training plans in which you may be involved. We won\u2019t be doing very much running as part of the series \u2013 most of our focus will be on discussions to better understand why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, exercises to strengthen our muscles, and drills to practice new techniques. You will likely find that the workshop complements your training comfortably.<br\/><b><i>Please note that you must be running a minimum of 10-15 miles per week for 2-3 weeks before the first session begins (and maintain this level throughout the five weeks) in order to participate. This is for your safety. <\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>What you\u2019ll get out of this series:<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>- The ability to safely and comfortably run with a natural, \u201cneutral\u201d gait.<br\/>- Stronger calf and foot muscles that will reduce your risk of leg injuries (and potentially make you faster than you\u2019ve ever been).\u00a0<br\/>- A training plan that carefully and safely guides you through the gait transition.\u00a0<br\/>- Careful review of your current biomechanics, plus basic coaching to correct any major issues that may be identified.<br\/>- An incredibly versatile TheraBand\u2122 exercise band, for use with your exercises (a $5-15 value, depending upon where you look).<br\/>- A series of stretches and strengthening exercises that you can use to stay strong and healthy.\u00a0<br\/>- A better understanding of your body\u2019s biomechanics and how everything works together when you run.\u00a0<br\/>- A new enjoyment of running because you\u2019ll be doing it the way nature intended.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Your commitment:\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>- Registration for the five-session series is $100 per person, due before the first session begins. This works out to $20 per session, which is really a good deal for professional coaching.\u00a0<br\/>- You will be asked to sign a waiver of liability. In other words, you confirm that you are fit and already logging at least 10-15 miles per week, regularly, and take this workshop on with the knowledge that strenuous activity always has the potential to result in injury - obviously, we\u2019ll take care to minimize that risk, but it\u2019s always there.\u00a0<br\/>- You must attend all five consecutive sessions. This is for your safety and to ensure you meet the goals of the workshop. If you anticipate being unavailable for a single session, please speak with your coach who will bend over backwards to accommodate you.

Then <b><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i><\/b> may be just for you! Channeled by the same voice that authored ACIM but in more easy to understand language, Mari Perron's <i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> speaks to the heart rather than the mind. Let's explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week, taking breaks whenever Yasuko is away teaching in Japan (usually November, March and July).<\/p> <p>It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i>A COURSE OF LOVE<\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.
