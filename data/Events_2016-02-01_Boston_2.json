As surprising as that may sound, it\u2019s the natural result of the world going digital. Marketing must move faster, adapt more quickly to market feedback, and manage an increasingly complex set of customer experience touchpoints. All of these challenges are shaped by the dynamics of software \u2014 from the growing number of technologies in our own organizations to the global forces of the Internet at large. We'll look at \u00a0how to conquer those challenges by adapting successful management frameworks from the software industry to the practice of marketing for any business in a digital world.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/b\/1\/600_441982193.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nScott's Bio:\u00a0<\/p> <p>Scott Brinker\u00a0is the author of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/chiefmartec.com\/\">chiefmartec.com<\/a>, a blog that examines\u00a0the intersection of marketing, technology, and management, and he's the program chair of the MarTech\u00a0conference.

But too often, the deliverable output is unread reports, spreadsheets or dashboards, which leaves the valuable insights unused, and underachieves the team's potential. Dr. LaGatta's talk will emphasize the role of operationalizing this data science output. The idea here is that data scientists do work exploring the data &amp; building models, then once these models are productionized, they deliver their insights to analysts via a simple review dashboard, or via existing ticketing systems &amp; workflows. The output of this review is then saved in state, and used as input for further models to reduce false positives &amp; optimize for meaningful results. This methodology has relevance for Network Operations Centers, Security Operations Centers, Business Operations Centers, and more. By aligning their output with operational workflows, data scientists generate value across the org, and guarantee success for their teams.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonml\/events\/227112839\/","yes_rsvp_count":286,"duration":7200000,"name":"Operationalizing Data Science Output","id":"227112839","time":1453246200000,"updated":1453500352000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411225981000,"name":"Boston Machine Learning","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":17107302,"urlname":"bostonml","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"74 Acton St","name":"Central Rock Climbing Gym","lon":-71.198532,"id":13269882,"state":"MA","lat":42.3694,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.60749197006,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425939087000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's climb at Central Rock Gym in Watertown!

Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<\/p> <p>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/p> <p>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

no limits!\"<\/b><\/p> <p>Thanks to the efficiency and BI (business intelligence) of Fair Foods of Dorchester (FairFoods.org), founded about 35 years ago by self-reported vegetarian Nancy Jamison, we have way more than AMPLE food for any intended audiences, and the operation is bettered if MORE people take the food than if FEWER take the food.<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is NO QUALIFICATION (no test of need) and no limit to how much you can cart off (just pay $2\/bag and $1\/loaf of bread).\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's why I post it on a\u00a0meetup\u00a0like this (not merely on a volunteer meetup).<\/p> <p>There are tens of thousands of college students who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>There are tens of thousands (myriads) of homemakers and working individuals who could benefit by saving some money on their weekly produce purchases.<br\/>Lots and lots of seniors AND needy folks, and there's no operational shame in prudent fiscal management if you know that you can get quality produce at a far lower price.<\/p> <p>[The snag is that, unlike in grocery stores - or even in Haymarket, your variety of produce is severely limited here because you're getting what Fair Foods sends to any specific site; you are unable to select from a broader arrangement of vegetables and a broader arrangement of fruits. \u00a0Typically, you get about 7-11 different items -

Mike will update us on what's happening with FOSS4G, and then let's try our hand at some mappy graphic design and make some logos. In the process we'll get a little acquainted with some vector and raster graphic design software, a very important part of almost every cartographer's toolkit.<\/p> <p>You will probably want to download some software ahead of time. These are some of the common tools:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Adobe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/illustrator.html\">Illustrator<\/a>\u00a0(vector) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/photoshop.html\">Photoshop<\/a>\u00a0(raster).

Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.<\/p> <p><br\/>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent\/collaborative work time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?<\/p> <p><br\/>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Head to the basement of CGIS Knafel","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maptime-Boston\/events\/228109934\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":7200000,"name":"UPDATED January Maptime: vector\/raster drawing and FOSS4G logo design","id":"228109934","time":1453332600000,"updated":1453342282000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1402411414000,"name":"Maptime Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":15000532,"urlname":"Maptime-Boston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02062","country":"us","city":"Norwood","address_1":"55 Providence Hwy","name":"Baystate Archery","lon":-71.184433,"id":15887312,"state":"MA","lat":42.209717,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":11.9421720505,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1399510303000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meetup for practice and introduction to archery!

Five free-spirited teenaged sisters splash about on the beach with their male classmates. Though their games are merely innocent fun, a neighbor passes by and reports what she considers to be illicit behavior to the girls' family. The family overreacts, removing all \"instruments of corruption,\" like cell phones and computers, and essentially imprisoning the girls, subjecting them to endless lessons in housework in preparation for them to become brides. As the eldest sisters are married off, the younger ones bond together to avoid the same fate. The fierce love between them empowers them to rebel and chase a future where they can determine their own lives in Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven's debut, a powerful portrait of female empowerment.<\/p> <p>Trailer:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kSbbcHxJtnA\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kSbbcHxJtnA<\/a><\/p> <p>Getting Together: The movie starts at 7:10.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Presented in Digital 3D\u2122 and IMAX\u00ae 3D, the film will transport audiences to the heart of the action, creating a fully-immersive cinematic experience on an epic scale. On February 18, 1952, a massive nor\u2019easter struck New England, pummeling towns along the Eastern seaboard and wreaking havoc on the ships caught in its deadly path, including the SS Pendleton, a T-2 oil tanker bound for Boston, which was literally ripped in half, trapping more than 30 sailors inside its rapidly-sinking stern. As the senior officer on board, first assistant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) soon realizes it is up to him to take charge of the frightened crew and inspire the men to set aside their differences and work together to ride out one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast. Meanwhile, as word of the disaster reaches the U.S. Coast Guard station in Chatham, Massachusetts, Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) orders a daring operation to rescue the stranded men. Despite overwhelming odds, four men, led by Coast Guard Captain Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), set out in a wooden lifeboat with an ill-equipped engine and little, if any, means of navigation, facing frigid temperatures, 60-foot high waves and hurricane-force winds.<\/p> <p>Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Finest Hours\u201d is the unforgettable story of the Coast Guard\u2019s courageous mission, which is directed by Craig Gillespie and stars: Chris Pine; Academy Award\u00ae and Golden Globe\u00ae nominee Casey Affleck; Ben Foster; Holliday Grainger; John Ortiz; and Eric Bana. Produced by Jim Whitaker and Dorothy Aufiero, the screenplay is by Oscar\u00ae nominee Scott Silver and Oscar nominees Paul Tamasy &amp; Eric Johnson based on the acclaimed non-fiction book of the same name by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman. Doug Merrifield serves as executive producer. \u201cThe Finest Hours\u201d storms into U.S. theaters on January 29, 2016 in Digital 3D\u2122 and IMAX\u00ae 3D.<\/p> <p>Website: Disney.com\/TheFinestHours<\/p> <p>Facebook: facebook.com\/thefinesthoursmovie<\/p> <p>\u00a92016 Disney Enterprises, Inc.<br\/>Rating: PG-13 <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/BQmllwTKtqU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/BQmllwTKtqU<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/228105880\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Finest Hours   1-21   Thur.

This isn\u2019t a class where you will learn everything, but a study group where we will learn from each other.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Makers-of-HATCH-Makerspace\/events\/227864713\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":7200000,"name":"Laser Cutter Study Group","id":"227864713","time":1453417200000,"updated":1453426571000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424789105000,"name":"Makers of HATCH Makerspace","group_lon":-71.1800003052,"id":18457932,"urlname":"Makers-of-HATCH-Makerspace","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center","name":"1CC","lon":-71.08535,"id":9466512,"state":"MA","lat":42.362583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.805574893951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451919975000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Over the past year, Power BI has been completely reinvented as a powerful new online service and a user friendly rich design tool.

I've been helping clients produce sales and marketing materials since 1984. I became a LinkedIn member in 2007, and have been teaching classes on LinkedIn at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education quarterly since 2013.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I posted my first blog in 2008, and included a link to in in my work email in hopes of engaging my clients (I was in commission sales) beyond traditional phone calls, visits and emails.\u00a0Later that year, I decided it\u00a0was\u00a0time to start my own thing. I founded Sophwell to help companies streamline how they produce and distribute physical marketing products. Using WordPress, I created my website and began blogging to help build credibility and interest in my company. In 2014 I started using the LinkedIn Posts function.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Jeff Cutler\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/106919771\/screenshot20150310at3.03.04pm.png\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For 20 years I\u2019ve been assisting people with messaging \u2013 and for 17 of those years I\u2019ve run a little company called Novel Ideas. No matter the name \u2013 Jeff Cutler or Novel Ideas \u2013 I\u2019m all about creating content that inspires and motivates.\u00a0How did I get here? After a harrowing college career where I dabbled in political science and finance, I emerged with a journalism degree and some healthy skepticism. I worked for New England Sports Network and more big brands than I can remember. Then I realized that life\u2019s about having some fun and I wandered into the fishbowl people call social media.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Here I swim, creating content, brainstorming strategy, training legions of newcomers and traditional media folks, and having fun.

It was a nice-to-have, after identifying a customer need and fulfilling it with a working product. The product had to work and it had to ship. If it was a great experience, well all the better. Times have changed. The cost of creating and delivering a product is no longer a barrier to entry. Quality is no longer a differentiator. What's left? The experience of using the product. If you're going to be truly competitive in today's markets, your products and services better have a great experience. To do that, a fundamental shift has to occur inside your organization. It's no longer acceptable to ship a product with a poor experience or to deliver poor customer service. Every part of the organization has to be infused with an understanding of great user experience. Your organization has to cross the UX Tipping Point.\u00a0<\/p> <p>BIO<br\/>Jared M. Spool is the founder of User Interface Engineering and a co-founder of Center Centre. If you've ever seen Jared speak about user experience design, you know that he's probably the most effective and knowledgeable communicator on the subject today. He's been working in the field of usability and experience design since 1978, before the term \"usability\" was ever associated with computers.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/5\/f\/1\/600_444969713.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Jared spends his time working with the research teams at User Interface Engineering, helps clients understand how to solve their design problems, explains to reporters and industry analysts what the current state of design is all about, and is a top-rated speaker at more than 20 conferences every year. With Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman, he is starting Center Centre, a new school in Chattanooga, TN, to create the next generation of industry-ready UX Designers. In 2014, the school, under the nickname of the Unicorn Institute, launched a Kickstarter project that successfully raised more that 600% of its initial goal. He is also the conference chair and keynote speaker at the annual UI Conference and UX Immersion Conference, and manages to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time. He is author of the book, Web Usability: A Designer's Guide and co-author of Web Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks that Work.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it.

But near-Earth asteroids, our closest neighbors in the Solar System, also offer hitherto unimagined opportunities for exploration and resource harvesting. They might even be the stepping stones we require to seed the solar system with space colonies. The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center, located at the CfA, is on the front line of asteroid discoveries and is vital to the research of asteroid scientists the world over. We'll explore its inner workings and how it contributes to both the fun and fear of near-Earth asteroids.<\/p> <p>For more information, including accessibility, or to sign up for the events mailing list, call the Public Affairs Office, (617)[masked] or email <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

Reliability, validity, and accuracy of that data is of vital importance. There are some real challenges anytime we interact with people in the hopes of understanding their beliefs, values, and opinions of our products. Often our own words and behaviors can affect another person's responses. In addition, those people are also under the influence of their own psycho\/social\/biological\/cultural history and frameworks. So how can we gather information without inadvertently skewing the outcome? How do we even know if\/when that has happened? What pitfalls do we need to avoid when dealing with these complex humans we call customers?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join us for this webinar hosted by Paula Gray, AIPMM Anthropologist, where we will step back and gain a better understanding of human behavior in general so we can move forward and use that information to our competitive advantage. Whether you use this knowledge in visits with customers, creating survey questions or leading a focus group, it will help you get the best possible (most accurate) data in those interactions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Topics covered will include:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The best time of day to conduct an interview or focus group\u00a0<\/p> <p>- How to be as physically neutral as possible in person so your presence doesn't affect respondent answers\u00a0<\/p> <p>- How to phrase questions to avoid bias\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The truth about inaccurate answers - intentional or unintentional by the respondent\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SUPAProductTalksBoston\/events\/228220044\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":3600000,"name":"Webcast: 4 Tips To Get The Most Out Of Market Research","id":"228220044","time":1453482000000,"updated":1453486827000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369289386000,"name":"SUPA Product Talks Boston","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":8606892,"urlname":"SUPAProductTalksBoston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Product People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Allston","address_1":"65 N Harvard Street","name":"Cumnock Turf Fields","lon":-71.125473,"id":23484576,"state":"MA","lat":42.366611,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.87456774712,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1427487403000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NUTSHELL - every week\u00a0day, 12:15ish until 1:45ish, Cumnock Turf Fields at Harvard Stadium, games of 4v4 up to 10v10 or larger depending on who shows, bring a white shirt and a dark\/colored shirt (but not a gray one), almost never canceled, read\u00a0below for more details before asking questions that are answered here, and read the comments for today's meetup to see if there is\u00a0anything important\u00a0about today.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\"><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/I0tPQQ<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT - Harvard Square is the closest T stop (red line). \u00a0Check Google Maps or other to find fastest way there from wherever you are.<\/p> <p>GETTING THERE BY RIDE SHARE - a lot of players in this meetup come by car and are nice enough to offer rides to others. Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Mindful eating is about eating with awareness. Awareness helps people to have a better sense of when they are hungry and when they are full, when they overeat, what cues them to overeat, and what types of situations or environmental factors make overeating more likely to happen. Mindfully eating is typically thought of as slowing down, tasting one\u2019s food, pacing oneself and being able to appreciate food more. However, this is simply is not enough instruction for people who want more of a conscious approach to changing unhelpful eating habits.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Recently I found the book Eating the Moment by Pavel Somov, Ph.D. This book offers 141 exercises to eat mindfully. They are clever, helpful, and experiential options to increase one\u2019s awareness of eating. The mindful eating groups that I will be co-hosting will be based on these 141 exercises. My goal is to get through the entire book, but to find people who are interested in doing it with me. If you are interested in this journey, you must get the book. Every time we meet for dinner there will be 2-3 exercises to try during the week, and we will report on how they went for each of us. For this first MeetUp group you can just show up and I will have a copy of the book, and if you want to look through it and discuss you can. For upcoming MeetUps, if you want to join, you would have to get the book.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Mindful Eating Meetups will be cohosted with other meetup groups, and will include locations on the North Shore as well as in and around Boston. We will try to meet consistently two Thursdays a month as well as 1-2 weekends a month. This event is being cross posted with Cambridge Ethnic Dining MeetUp and MAY INCLUDE MEN.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In addition, here is an exercise that I would like participants to consider, in the overarching theme of awareness of ethnic diversity and food:<\/p> <p>1)\u00a0 Research the country of the ethnic food MeetUp group and make a list of current facts about the country. Consider facts that you find interesting or fascinating and share your facts with the group.<\/p> <p>2)\u00a0 Find a food or spice that the restaurant uses in its dishes and research any health benefits, uses for the food, or other interesting facts about the food. Introduce the food to the group. Share the unique aspects of this food\/ spice and\/ or recipe with the group.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As always, I will document people who NO SHOW as a NO SHOW and move towards not letting you attend future events. So if you make a commitment, come. \u00a0End of story.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"look for the yellow banana on the table \/RSVP under my name","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/228243686\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Mindful Eating- Chinese Food","id":"228243686","time":1453503600000,"updated":1453516200000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02108","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"25 School Street","name":"Scholars Boston","lon":-71.059113,"id":9201122,"state":"MA","lat":42.357552,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.581889152527,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453152102000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Come join us for a night of great drinks and even better conversation.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>The Boston Beards will be hosting Silicon Drinkabout this week at <a href=\"http:\/\/scholarsbostonbistro.com\/\">Scholars<\/a>.

We join the affable director as he crisscrosses Tehran behind the wheel of a taxi, giving rides to a variety of its denizens, ranging from a pirated DVD dealer, to two old women transporting a goldfish to a religious shrine, to his own charmingly chatty young niece, to the human rights lawyer who worked with him when he was in prison.

The mocking of oppression may be steely, but the film\u2019s an easy ride.\u201d (And here is a review by Lane\u2019s New Yorker colleague, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/richard-brody\/jafar-panahis-remarkable-taxi\">Richard Brody<\/a>.)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/6\/5\/600_445705445.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Dir.: Jafar Panahi (Iran, 2015, 82 min.)

In addition to the outer physical world, there is also the private, inner world of our conscious experiences and thoughts. In the philosophy of mind, the separation of the world into two radically different kinds of things is called dualism [ref 1].<\/p> <p>The paradox of dualism is this:\u00a0We seem to hold contradictory views about how the two worlds interact. In our practical everyday world, we talk as if the mental world and physical world causally interact. However, we know that something mental (non-physical) cannot causally interact with something physical. It would violate the laws of physics [refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6].<\/p> <p>How do these two worlds interact? (1) How does the physical world affect the mental world? For example, when you look at a flower, how can your brain create your perception of the flower? How does it create your awareness of that perception? Now consider the opposite direction.\u00a0(2) How does the mental world affect the physical world? For example, how can your decision to raise your arm cause your arm to go up?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our meeting will focus on question (2), the second half of the paradox of dualism.\u00a0<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br\/>References:<\/p> <p>[ref 1] \u201cInteractionist\u201d, Encyclopedia Britannica<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/interactionism\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/interactionism<\/a><\/p> <p>[ref 2] \u201cDualist view of mental causation\u201d<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)#Dualist_views_of_mental_causation\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)#Dualist_views_of_mental_causation<\/a><\/p> <p>[ref 3] \u201cProblems of Interaction\u201d, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Scott Calef,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.iep.utm.edu\/dualism\/#SH7c\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.iep.utm.edu\/dualism\/#SH7c<\/a><\/p> <p>[ref 4] \u201cVarieties of Dualism: Interaction\u201d, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,\u00a0Howard Robinson, <a href=\"http:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/dualism\/#VarDuaInt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/dualism\/#VarDuaInt<\/a><\/p> <p>[ref 5] \u201cIs energy always conserved, even in the case of the expanding universe?\u201d, lara Moskowitz , Scientific American, August 5, 2014,<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/energy-can-neither-be-created-nor-destroyed\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/energy-can-neither-be-created-nor-destroyed\/<\/a><\/p> <p>[ref 6] \u201cGiving Dualism It\u2019s Due\u201d, Australasian Journal of Philosophy,[masked] (2009), William G.

This water has spent time in a magnetite chamber which has created a powerful localized magnetic field in the water that rejuvenates our cell structure and improves the function of metabolic processes. Because magnetized water is wetter and therefore more penetrating, it furthers better assimilation of the various nutrients and vitamins in the cells. The Soviet biologist Kumarov had experimentally doubled the life span of flies by feeding them magnetized sugar. \u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.life-sources.com\/pages\/The-Health-Benefits-of-Magnetic-Water.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.life-sources.com\/pages\/The-Health-Benefits-of-Magnetic-Water.html<\/a>)<\/p> <p><br\/>We celebrate the sign of Aquarius as we move into the eleventh house at this time. The Water bearer is the sign of friendships. \"The Eleventh House speaks to destiny -- in simple terms, our hopes and dreams, what we desire and what we want to achieve. Our creative vision is highlighted, the simple act of working toward our maximal selves. The power of collective creation, as well as the creative sparks generated by the group, are also important to this house. By banding together, we can create so much more.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>Water is the true symbol of purification. As Jesus said, \"All men must be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul. \u00a0This healing brings the cleansing to our mind ever moment. Therefore, \"the key message of January is don\u2019t divide life into spiritual and mundane, special and ordinary.\u00a0It\u2019s all special and all mundane. Everything we do has power. Every word, action, thought, feeling and intention carries weight in this universe.\u00a0If we deem the everyday world of work, commuting, shopping, cleaning, earning enough to keep ourselves afloat, as somehow less worthy than when we\u2019re \u2018being spiritual\u2019 we deny\u00a0the presence of the sacred at the heart of our life.\"<\/p> <p>So if you come to the Buddhist Temple for a sound healing, what can you expect?\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you come in, you take your shoes off, then you walk to the Dharma Hall which will be on your immediate right at the top of the stairs. We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be new years resolutions - specifically bringing in the vibrations we need! Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go. Tingshas, tuning forks, rattles and more are all part of the play as the sound moves you to rest at your destination without ever having moved. So, please, come and feel something unique. You never leave anywhere exactly the same, but when it comes to sound healing, you will leave sounding more like yourself :)<\/p> <p>Please bring a blanket to enhance the comfort of your experience!

Hell, we\u2019ll even throw a classical music concert or two. What's in store this week? Let's find out:<\/p> <p>Schuyler Stevens will be giving a walk through of hardware &amp; software used in most DJ setups. From the grooves in the record right down to the electronics found inside your average mixer, Serato box, etc. You will gain a fundamental understanding of how each piece of equipment you will be using works for DJ\u2019ing and scratching.<\/p> <p>Schuyler Stevens started out in Burlington Vermont learning how to DJ and make music when he was 15. He got his own pair of turntables and inherited a small portion of his parents record collection and was off at light speed, challenging himself and pushing his own limits ever since. Schuyler moved to Boston and attended The New England\u00a0Institute of Art when he was 18 to continue his pursuit for more knowledge. Since going to school, Stevens has been gigging as a DJ\/turntablist in the local Boston scene as well as in Brooklyn, NY. He has also been tracking and producing songs for multiple MC\u2019s around Boston. His music draws inspiration from old records, and mixes\u00a0sounds of vintage samples with modern day synthesis, recording, and processing techniques.<\/p> <p>Schuyler believes that you can never stop learning, there will always be somebody who can show you something you never thought was possible, and in turn inspire you to push your own boundaries beyond what you imagined you could do. It is an ongoing loop perpetuated by people of like minds all striving for the same musical bliss, but in their own unique ways.

What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to be authentic.

Kali performed at the Halloween Block Party and several other Medford events this past year!<\/p> <p>For samples of his music and more about Kali: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectkali.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectkali.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectkali.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Biography: Kali grew up in the North East Kindom of Vermont playing around with poetry, hip hop and chorus until he picked up the guitar at 17. His attention was always rooted in music, but the guitar gave him insight and opened his eyes and ears to a new world of musical creation. His passion grew as he fused his musical past with Americana, Island and Folk, stripping him of a particular genre and transforming him into an eclectic singer songwriter.<br\/>In 2010, he moved with his family out of Vermont and into Boston in search of more people to spread music too. He is now based in the Boston area where he lives with his wife Jennifer, and his children Nia, Asha, and Sekou. His family and the necessity of positive experiences inspire him to create music for the people. \u201cI strive to create more than Feel Good Music, I create Get Good Music. Music is medicine for the masses. When we come together, we treat the ailments in our society and communities. This is something I cannot ignore, nor should anyone else.\u201d<\/p> <p><br\/>He moves all throughout New England and New York, playing community events and festivals and opening up for acts like Adam Ezra Group (2013 New England Music Awards-\u201cBand of the Year\u201d), Taj Mahal and the Taj Mahal Trio (Grammy Award winning blues legend), and Martin Sexton (one of the most talked-about arrivals on the \u201cnew folk\u201d acoustic music scene and hard working do it yourself artist). His debut self-titled album \u201cKALI\u201d came out in Nov of 2014.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sanctuary hosts a <b>monthly<\/b> Music for the Soul Coffeehouse.\u00a0 It almost always falls on the fourth Friday!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>This is a BYOB (wine and beer) and we will provide the coffee.<\/b><\/p> <p>Sanctuary UCC also offers and monthly faith and film screening and discussion, a monthly installation of the visual arts and occasional spoken word events.<\/p> <p><br\/>To get on the mailing list for Sanctuary's \"Arts and Inspiration\" Series which includes Music for the Soul, Faith and Film, The Gallery (visual arts) and spoken word events - send an email to [masked].<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sanctuaryucc.org\">www.sanctuaryucc.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Music-For-the-Soul-Medford\/events\/227417998\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Kali Stoddard-Imari Music for the Soul Coffeehouse","id":"dlgvjlyvcbdc","time":1453509000000,"updated":1453520546000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431014740000,"name":"Music For the Soul | Medford","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":18581305,"urlname":"Music-For-the-Soul-Medford","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"50 Dudley St","name":"Boston OM Center","lon":-71.131248,"id":24202812,"state":"MA","lat":42.395687,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.98987722397,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453131590000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and shared energy.\u00a0How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in Boston?<\/p> <p>At TurnON, we play three communication games (just talking, no touching), and you can participate at whatever level feels good to you.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 9 am. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away.

Built by the controversial Frank Gehry in 2004, it is home to the a few Electrical Engineering and Computer Science labs as well as the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/7\/e\/600_446087230.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Frank Gehry is the Pritzker Prize winning architect, who's buildings have become world renowned attractions. Gehry works on the edges of modernism and funk architecture while delving deeply into experimentation. However many of his works have attracted criticism of not being functional buildings. In 2007, MIT sued Gehry\u00a0for \"providing deficient design services and drawings\" which caused leaks to spring, masonry to crack, mold to grow, drainage to back up, and falling ice and debris to block emergency exits. The design has been praised by some and decried by others, and is a polarizing building in the architectural world.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/0\/2\/600_446087362.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Let's check out this masterpiece and try our skills at drawing modernism architecture.

I will provide handout cards so you can practice the assignments again after the class.<\/p> <p>At the end class there will be social time where we will take a look at the photos of the day and give each other constructive critique. I highly recommend you plan on joining us for this part of the workshop. We also critique our work after class on our group site so you can post 5 photos from class and get feedback.

Great group of men and women who have served our country and have come back needing a little help. The Center, which was started by a Veteran, provides housing, health care, social services, food, as well as a multitude of other services for our returning heroes. They have volunteer groups come in on weekends and do breakfast service. We don't provide the food, just smiles and friendly faces. The serving starts at 7:15am and we would be done by around 9.\u00a0 We have gone as a group several times and hope to keep this up monthly, there's a limit to 6 servers each time. It's really a wonderful time. Some of the ladies asked about baking\/bringing something. I also spoke with the head of the kitchen....just avoid things with nuts because of allergies. Hope to see you all then! We can carpool, it's near the Orange line and if you drive in you can park right in front. Also remember a hat, you need to have your head\/hair covered to serve.<\/p> <p>\u00a0My telephone number if you have any questions or have a last minute change to status is[masked]<\/p> <p>2 things:<br\/>1. Since this is a popular event, I'd like to ask that you only sign up only if you are able to get up early on a Sunday.\u00a0 There will be several Sundays throughout the year I'll actually take myself off as well so that opens up one spot. On the days I cook, I'll also open it up to have 7 servers so that more can come.<br\/>2. To prevent the # of no shows we've had, I'm going to just let everyone know that if you know show, I will remove you from future volunteer opportunities with the Center. I've hated the times when due to no shows, the Vets have had to step in to help, especially because there are often individuals that were on the wait list and didn't have the opportunity to show. If you cannot attend, please RSVP no ahead of time, or at the very least, just call or text me if you aren't well the morning of the shift, just so I know and can get them to provide help when I get there. My telephone # is[masked]-1526. Those letting me know that they can't make a day ahead of time won't be considered a no show.<\/p> <p>Thank you for your ongoing support.

It also includes examples of how Spiritualism is a part of our lives on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Mediumship, or Spirit Communication, is the part of the service where a medium proves that \"...the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.\" The medium might be a member of our church or visiting from another the Spiritualist church in the community.

There will be a limit of 5 photographers for this 2 hour shoot and it will go like clockwork giving each photographer plenty of time to shoot and observe the setups and model positioning for a learning experience.

In a society that values confidence and assertiveness, \"insecure\" is one of the worst, most damning insults with which to characterize a person. But what if we are missing out on the great beauty, insight, and connection that can come from embracing some of our insecurities?\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you live in America today, you may have noticed a lot of talk about the virtue of security. Immigration debates rage over border security; threats of terrorism are addressed by the Department of Homeland Security; and the private home security industry is growing daily, with increasingly advanced alarm systems soon to be a $50 billion industry worldwide. It can be a fun game to notice how often politicians like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz speak, with great confidence, about the need for more security-- just don't make it a drinking game, or you may need your stomach pumped.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Surely all of us want to be as safe as we can reasonably be. But as Alan Watts argued in his 1951 book The Wisdom of Insecurity, we all suffer and we are all mortal, so even trying to be 100% safe and secure is, by definition, an act of lying to ourselves. And, as Greg will argue in this talk, in a 2016 where change is the only constant, and where traditional sources of security for some, such as patriarchy and racism, are thankfully in decline: we have so much to gain if we can learn to accept and even value some of our own insecurity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Greg, who has been the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University for over a decade, holds various advanced degrees, and is the New York Times bestselling author of Good Without God, will be speaking on a subject around which he has considerable expertise. After all, Greg has many years of experience at being insecure about his own insecurities! Only in recent years has he begun to accept his own lack of confidence as potentially a good thing, which in turn has allowed him to connect more deeply with his community, which has in turn caused him to notice that most of the people he loves and admires best are, non-coincidentally, insecure in some way.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join Greg for his first 2016 monthly talk at the Hub: with music, food, discussion circles, and more.<\/p> <p>Prospective first-time attendees are especially encouraged to attend this event!<\/p> <p>Childcare is available at this and all Hub Sunday programs.

There will be an interesting foreground for the moon to go over or behind (the Boston Logan tower).<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Compose such that about the bottom third is landscape and the top 2\/3 are sky. Compose such that the moon comes up in the lower left corner (not too close to the edge) and you may have to make quick last minute adjustments once you see the moon coming over the horizon. Don't fret missing the first seconds, as the moon fills the space as it comes up.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Plan for a very long, single exposure, around 20-40 minutes (after that it exits the frame), exposure time will be calculated for ambient landscape (with a <a href=\"http:\/\/jmlobert.blogspot.com\/2015\/01\/high-iso-preview-hip.html\">high ISO preview<\/a> - HIP - before the moon comes up).<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 The shot is taken with a long zoom (150mm or more, ideally[masked]mm), which is what makes the moon look \"large\" compared to the area you zoom into (the town and jetty above, the foreground object in our event).<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 The lens is equipped with an extreme neutral density (ND) filter, 10 stops or more. 8 stops might work for the second approach, less will not. This is done to get the moon correctly exposed and avoid clipping its lights during the long exposure necessary for the landscape through the filter. The moon stays in \"one place\" only for about 4 minutes, so the exposure needs to be right for those 4 minutes. After that, the moon is right \"next\" to its prior self in terms of composition, the light no longer adds to the previous position. An ND filter denser than 10 stops would only make the moon streak darker, the ambient landscape would still be exposed right as determined with the HIP.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 A <a href=\"http:\/\/jmlobert.blogspot.com\/2015\/01\/high-iso-preview-hip.html\">high ISO preview<\/a> (HIP) will give you an approximate starting point for the landscape exposure. Consider that it will get a little darker as the moon comes up. This is one day after full moon, chosen on purpose, because the sun sets an hour before the moon rises.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 The exposure time and aperture are then chosen for the length of the moon trail as well as the surrounding landscape.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0You can adjust exposure by raising the ISO or changing the aperture. The landscape will be far away, so it won't make much difference if you use f\/5.6 or f\/11, which gives you an easy adjustment for exposure.<\/p> <p>\u2022 The above is shot at f\/5.6 and ISO 400 for 47 minutes (to get the ambient exposure right) and a 16-stop ND filter. However, the moon exited the frame around 30 minutes, I included too much foreground. I calculated the exposure and was spot-on, but the 16-stop was a bit too much, hence, ISO 400. A 10-stop ND filter would have allowed me to shoot at ISO 50 and f\/16, same exposure time.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 The foreground was actually blurred (the jetty moved up and down), so I took a short (1-minute) exposure afterwards and combined the sky and foreground in Photoshop.<\/p> <p>\u2022 If you have enough patience, a dark frame of the same length, ISO and with closed aperture and cap on the lens is recommended afterwards, because 20-40 minute exposures have a lot of fixed pixel noise. Subtract the dark frame from the image using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pixelfixer.org\/\">PixelFixer<\/a>. You can enable Long Exposure Noise Reduction (LENR), but you won't see the image and can't take a short exposure until another 30-40 minutes after the exposure.<\/p> <p>For this first time in a group, I chose an easy to get to location: the harborwalk and our zoom-into object is the airport tower. Picture this with a moon streak going behind (and perhaps a few airplane trails going up and down (artist's (ahem) rendition of the moon streak behind the tower):<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/6\/3\/600_445586467.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Future locations will be more exciting, but it's hard to find a stand-alone feature that is interesting enough, between 1 and 1.5 unobstructed miles away and in the right direction of the rising moon. I used PlanIt! Pro to plan this out, better than TPE. Suggestions welcome!<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>2) Assembled moon streak<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 The below image was taken with a second camera (and tripod) with a 10-stop filter, which was not quite dense enough, I had to shoot at ISO 50 (not 100) and f\/32 to reduce the amount of light. Exposure time was limited to a few minutes initially, then I had to gradually reduce the exposure time and take multiple shots, 30-seconds at the end. I then stacked all images together for the resulting photo. Overall length is roughly 25 minutes. Easier to do, because you don't need to plan ahead for 30 minutes. The nice thing about this one is that the moon does not exit the frame. The streak is not as smooth and you can see the breaks between exposures as small indents, even though interruption between any two shots was only a few seconds. The moon moves quickly with a long zoom!<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/c\/e\/600_444931438.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>3) Full moon rising<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have a 2nd or 3rd camera, you can also simply shoot the full moon coming up over the horizon, which is substantially easier to do and does not require ND filters. Exposure time is somewhere shorter than 1\/90th of a second, ideally shot with mirror up and using a remote control. The challenge here is to not blow the moon out (it has features that you want to show) but also not blur it and to get a composition with an interesting foreground, perhaps with the moon half behind it. Because it is one day after full moon, the landscape will be rather dark when the moon rises (an hour after sunset) and you will have to boost shadows in post-processing a lot.<\/p> <p><br\/>It will be cold and you will be standing around not doing much. Dress accordingly, bring gloves and head gear. This will be a rather short meetup, about an hour to 90 minutes. Once the moon is way up, it becomes uninteresting and too bright, but you can certainly stay to shoot things around the harborwalk (like the aquarium right behind us) only or zoom in on the moon alone.<\/p> <p><br\/>The meetup address is a dead-end and no parking right there. Use Google maps to find a nearby garage, but don't use the very expensive Aquarium garage.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/227326501\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Advanced NPy: Moon Streak","id":"227326501","time":1453672800000,"updated":1453694453000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"50 Quincy St. (Swedenborg Chapel)","name":"Quincy St @ Kirkland St Bus Station","lon":-71.109734,"id":24274202,"state":"MA","lat":42.373615,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":2.24069142342,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451451823000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ESL Students Event!<\/p> <p>This is a free event.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

From Roger &amp; Me to Bowling for Columbine to Fahrenheit 9\/\u200b\u200b11, he's been ahead of the cultural curve with films that galvanized audiences and escalated box-office records. Now, six years since his last film and with another US election around the corner, he delivers a fresh surprise that feels current yet perfectly timeless. Filming abroad without drawing attention from American media, Moore reunites his A-team, including producers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin (directors of the Oscar-nominated Trouble the Water), and brings us a funny and provocative work that's guaranteed to stir up conversation. The United States' long history of invading countries and pushing agendas has produced results that are, to say the least, mixed. What if the US could do a better job at invading? That's the premise for this film, which sends Moore on an epic journey.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/r4JJvfrkH3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/r4JJvfrkH3M<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/228205268\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Where To Invade Next   1-25  Mon.

Like her fictional forebears Kate Reddy and Bridget Jones, Alice plays many roles (which she never refers to as \u201cwearing many hats\u201d and wishes you wouldn\u2019t, either). She is a mostly-happily married mother of three, an attentive daughter, an ambivalent dog-owner, a part-time editor, a loyal neighbor and a Zen commuter. She is not: a cook, a craftswoman, a decorator, an active PTA member, a natural caretaker or the breadwinner. But when her husband makes a radical career change, Alice is ready to lean in\u2014and she knows exactly how lucky she is to land a job at Scroll, a hip young start-up which promises to be the future of reading, with its chain of chic literary lounges and dedication to beloved classics. The Holy Grail of working mothers\u2015an intellectually satisfying job and a happy personal life\u2015seems suddenly within reach.<\/p> <p>Despite the disapproval of her best friend, who owns the local bookstore, Alice is proud of her new \u201cbalancing act\u201d (which is more like a three-ring circus) until her dad gets sick, her marriage flounders, her babysitter gets fed up, her kids start to grow up and her work takes an unexpected turn.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/227610270\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvcbhc","time":1453766400000,"updated":1453782166000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Quincy","address_1":"40 Washington St","name":"Thomas Crane Public Library","lon":-71.000809,"id":19850262,"lat":42.250957,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.33950328827,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452280117000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and relive your favorite classic video game experiences at our Retro Video Game Night!

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/228217045\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvcbhc","time":1453768200000,"updated":1453782806000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"44 Fifth Street","name":"Moves & Vibes Dance Studio","lon":-71.188751,"id":19335432,"state":"MA","lat":42.184925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5623426437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449461070000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>December 7th, Moves &amp; Vibes Dance Co starting a 8-week advance beginner Zouk beginners course.

While it is not as firm as a curriculum, and I am NOT an expert on the areas covered. They are just interesting areas that I have been meaning to experiment around with and might interest people. I will be doing a short introduction on the subject and a certain amount of time will probably be spent experimenting in the topic of choice each session. The Idea is to narrow the field a bit for each session, and attack a different thing each time to demonstrate and cover a bunch of varying topics within the pretty wide scope of this meetup.<\/p> <p>the general structure:<br\/>8:00 PM - Class starts<br\/>8:30PM-8:40PM - Primer on the night's subject. NOT supposed to be ridiculously in depth, just an intro or inspiration.<\/p> <p>8:40-9:00: discussion questions and brainstorming. For those that know additional information on the subject, this is the part when it is brought up. This is also the part of the night where we come up with initial project ideas surrounding the presented subject. 9:00-10:00: collaborative experimentation. This is the part that we play around with what we can get done together or in groups. The focus of this hour is less on product, and more on collaboration and mutual assistance to get people up and running with new techniques. Those who are already comfortable should help those who are less comfortable. 10:00-10:15: wrap up. Re-gather and Discuss next session's topic. 10:15-??: Personal Project Time - As available, Get feedback and help on personal projects you are working on from the members of the group.<\/p> <p>-------------------About me--------------------------<br\/>I am an artist and engineer.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach (played by Hugh Jackman), Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.

Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/227428137\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":10800000,"name":"PARTY GAME NIGHT","id":"227428137","time":1453849200000,"updated":1453947035000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1815 Massachusetts Ave ","name":"Bourbon Coffee","lon":-71.118393,"id":21611192,"state":"MA","lat":42.387295,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.11429214478,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453155072000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello everyone!<\/p> <p>Let's continue with our discussion on Burton Malkiel's \"A random walk down Wall Street\" with chapters 4-6.

It brings CSS out of the lofty realm of the academic and turns it into something far friendlier to the daily workflow of front end developers or designers. However, despite these nice features, and sometimes because of them, teams can run into problems with their stylesheets as files grow along with the project. Careful use of Sass techniques, including the Exception comment, can help bring that under control.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Bio: Eric Bailey is a User Experience designer and front end dabbler working at Cantina, a Digital Design &amp; Development Agency located in the Fort Point Channel. He is a strong advocate of semantics and accessibility, and enjoys creating straightforward, device-agnostic solutions that address the practical, physical, cognitive, and emotional needs of the user.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Optimizing Animations on the Web<\/b><\/p> <p>Bio: David Putney worked for 20 years in the newspapers business, where he\u2019s been a reporter, copy editor, print designer and co-founder of a daily newspaper. Most recently he worked for The Boston Globe, where he designed BDCWire.com and Cruxnow.com, among other projects. He is currently is a UI\/UX consultant and front-end developer at Cantina, a digital consulting agency in the Fort Point area of Boston.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Zurb Foundation 6, what is updated and how to get started<\/b><\/p> <p>Description: Zurb released a new version of Foundation for Sites, a CSS and Front-End Framework last month. Daigo will walk through the features and also show how you can get up and running with a new site using this framework in just few minutes. Great for getting something up really quick, like in a hackathon. We can discuss pros and cons of css and front end frameworks in general as well.<\/p> <p><br\/>Bio: Daigo Fujiwara is a front end web developer at Harvard Business Review, and founder\/organizer of Baseball Hack Day, Fun, friendly, free, one-day, on-site hacking\/coding competition for baseball fans, happening in Boston March 19, 2016.

Python, Go, and the Cost of Concurrency in the Cloud by Chris Erway (Chief Architect, AppNeta)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>This talk will discuss how Go\u2019s ability to provide easy concurrency have an impact on not just performance, but also your AWS bill!\u00a0 As a case study we will present an event-processing service in production at\u00a0AppNeta\u00a0that we moved from Python to Go last year.\u00a0 This service stores unique data blobs at a rate of roughly 1000\/sec, each on average 70KB in size, and the talk walks through a few approaches to meeting this demand cost-effectively using cloud services such as Amazon S3, SQS, Kinesis, and DynamoDB.<\/p> <p><br\/>The service was originally written in Python, and while scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and Node.js offer a fun and fast hacking experience (without the extra boilerplate or semicolons required by \"less fun\" languages) all three suffer from the same basic limitation \u2014 a single-threaded interpreter that cannot perform concurrent computation.\u00a0 To make use of multiple cores, a programmer typically must run many processes in separate interpreters, and use IPC to communicate between them.\u00a0 Support for asynchronous I\/O as available in Node.js, Python's Tornado, Gevent, Twisted, or Ruby's EventMachine offers some ability to parallelize some I\/O, but not computation.<\/p> <p><br\/>However Go seems to offer the best of both worlds: fun hacking without the semicolons, but also easy access to concurrency and a compiler offering type-checking and runtime performance much faster than scripting languages.\u00a0 Chris Erway, chief architect at\u00a0AppNeta, will prevent a case study of a service that was ported from Python to Go last year, and how doing so resulted not just in better performance, but also a much more cost-efficient service \u2014 over 80% cheaper than the most naive implementation, and over 2x cheaper than the Python implementation\u2019s deployment.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nOur thanks go out to Akamai for the venue, food and drinks.<\/p> <p>Here's to a great 2016!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Go-lang-User-Group\/events\/227889016\/","yes_rsvp_count":46,"duration":5400000,"name":"January Boston Golang Meetup","id":"227889016","time":1453851000000,"updated":1453857808000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411925008000,"name":"Boston Golang","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":17264952,"urlname":"Boston-Go-lang-User-Group","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Gophers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center","name":"Microsoft","lon":-71.08535,"id":15594572,"state":"MA","lat":42.362583,"repinned":false},"headcount":83,"distance":0.805574893951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452095915000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Did you know that <b>SQL Server 2016<\/b> is anticipated to be released in less than six months?\u00a0 Come learn about the new features and functionality that enable mission critical performance, deeper insights across data, and accelerate integration with Azure.\u00a0 This session will be part discussion and part demo.\u00a0 The demonstration portion will cover as many features as possible within the time allocated such as:<\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 SSRS enhancements and Mobile reports<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 PolyBase<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 Advanced Analytics<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 Stretch DB<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 Always Encrypted<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00b7\u00a0 Data Masking<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout this month\u2019s\u00a0speaker:<b>ANTHONY MARTIN<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Principal Consultant<\/p> <p>Anthony Martin is a data professional with over 10 years of experience designing and implementing solutions utilizing the Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence platform.

We aim to have reoccurring discussions moving forward so we can stay abreast of local, national, and global anti-racism issues both as individuals and together as a community. We have seen a huge surge in media coverage within the racial justice movement over the past year. It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Know of a local story\/action\/event that may not be getting coverage? Great! Feel free to post in the comments section below or email one of the facilitators with your ideas. We hope you'll come to this session willing to share a current event you've learned about over the past month or so.

Everyone with an open mind and sense of adventure is welcome, whether you're a travel novice or an experienced travel junkie.<\/p> <p>This month we'll meet at Tavern in the Square @ Porter Sq. This is a very accessible location; There is parking closeby, and it's literally a 1 min walk from the T (red-line) - just exit the T station and walk down Mass Ave, away from the big Porter Sq parking lot. There are lots of convenient bus connections too. We'll be in the front area, to the right of the bar.<\/p> <p>Each month, we generally switch back and forth between Porter Sq and White Horse Tavern in Allston.

For all returning and new members, let\u2019s start off this year with a bang!<\/p> <p>This month, we will be doing a comparison between disasters using what I like to call the classroom catastrophe trope. Basically, it consists of what normal, everyday students will do to overcome a massive, extremely dangerous situation that they are thrust into without any warning. These can include natural disasters, demonic or alien invasion or zombie apocalypse to name a few. Or, as shown in the selected titles, a combination of all three! So, for your comparison, Assassination Classroom volume 1 by Yusei Matsui and Magical Girl Apocalypse volume 1 by Kentaro Sato!<\/p> <p><b>Assassination Classroom Volume 1 by Yusei Matsui <\/b><\/p> <p><i>The students in Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High have a new teacher: an alien octopus with bizarre powers and unlimited strength, who\u2019s just destroyed the moon and is threatening to destroy the earth\u2014unless they can kill him first!<\/p> <p>Meet the would-be assassins of class 3-E: Sugino, who let his grades slip and got kicked off the baseball team. Karma, who's doing well in his classes but keeps getting suspended for fighting. And Okuda, who lacks both academic and social skills, yet excels at one subject: chemistry. Who has the best chance of winning that reward? Will the deed be accomplished through pity, brute force or poison...? And what chance does their teacher have of repairing his students' tattered self-esteem? <\/i><\/p> <p><b>Magical Girl Apocalypse volume 1 by Kentaro Sato<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not your mommy's magical girls!<\/p> <p>High-schooler Kii Kogami is stuck in a rut, loathing the monotonous doldrums of his everyday life. If only something exciting were to happen, something magical. As fate would have it, Kii is about to get his wish, but in a way more terrifying than anything he could have imagined.<br\/>When a little girl clad in gothic lolita attire appears at school and starts to gruesomely bludgeon, dismember and mutilate all who cross her path, while chanting the mantra \"Magical Girl\" from her corpse-like lips, the school devolves into a state of bloody chaos.<\/p> <p>Just how will Kii escape from this murderous magical girl? To make matters worse, the magical girl's victims reanimate and join her killer rampage as minions. Is there no way out of school for hapless Kii Kogami? And even if he escapes, what will be left of the world outside? <\/i><\/p> <p>A limited number of copies will be at the venue, and don\u2019t forget our special deal! On the night of the Manga Club, all participants get ten percent off all graphic novels in the store, and twenty five percent off any future Manga Club title releases in stock! So if you come to the November Manga Club event, you can get the December title for twenty five percent off as available!
