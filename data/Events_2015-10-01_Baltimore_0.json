Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

The memorial is inscribed \"Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds\". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\"><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>4. At 6:30 pm sharp, we'll walk up to the ticket window together and buy tickets.\u00a0 Please bring $10 in CASH to pay for your ticket.<\/p> <p>5. If you're running late, call me on my cell before 6:30 pm and we'll either wait a few minutes for you, or we'll head in and let you know where we're sitting.<\/p> <p>6. You can park at the stadium for $8.\u00a0 Again, bring cash.<\/p> <p>7. If anyone would like to ride up with me from the Laurel\/Columbia area, please let me know.\u00a0 I'm going to be leaving as soon after 5 pm as possible--definitely no later than 5:15.<\/p> <p>8. You're allowed to bring your own water, soda and snacks into the stadium. Those are often nice to have.<\/p> <p>9. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see.<\/p> <p>10. It might be sunny and hot Tuesday with a small chance of scattered showers (forecast TBD).\u00a0 We'll get tickets in the shade and under the roof so any sun or passing rain won't bother us :-).<\/p> <p>See everyone Tuesday nite!<\/p>",

Check out their website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/<\/a><\/p> <p>RHLC has a multi-faceted food ministry. On Saturdays they feed the needy at Pioneer Village in Odenton - giving out food and flowers. Also, in their <b><i>Missions for America<\/i><\/b> ministry, they house, feed and clothe single mothers, orphans, and the homeless. These ministries need help now - and they are growing. Please come help David and Tracy in this wonderful work. At this organizational meeting, we will find the best way for you to help.<\/p> <p><b><i>Additional Request #1<\/i><\/b>: David and Tracy are working on building a full commercial kitchen at their church. Please think: how can you help them? Do you know where they can receive donations and\/or reduced-price commercial refrigerators and kitchen equipment? Can you help with installation, transportation and\/or County permitting? Can you help them find other storage and refrigeration locations for the food donations they receive in the interim? Please put on your thinking-cap and think of ways you can help support and build this food ministry.<\/p> <p><b><i>Additional Request #2<\/i><\/b>: Please pray for the people and families in <b><i>Missions for America<\/i><\/b> - pray that they can get jobs, get back on their feet, and get the help they need.\u00a0 See website here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/ministries\/missions-for-america\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/ministries\/missions-for-america\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rhlc.us\/ministries\/missions-for-america\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b><i>Bible Study<\/i><\/b>: After this organizational meeting, feel free to stay at the church for the 7pm Bible Study.<\/p> <p><b><i>Parking<\/i><\/b>: At RHLC you can park near the front door of the church at 7489 Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard (along the street or in the free parking garage across the street).

It's one that I've wanted to read for a while now but just haven't gotten around to it: Anthony Burgess's <i>A Clockwork Orange.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>From Amazon.com:\u00a0A vicious fifteen-year-old droog is the central character of this 1963 classic. In Anthony Burgess's nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology.\u00a0A Clockwork Orange\u00a0is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex to \"redeem\" him, the novel asks, \"At what cost?\"<\/p> <p>Distopians, to me, are always interesting to read, so I can't wait to dive into this one. I know what I'm doing on the plane next week! Hope to see everyone there.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>For more than five years now, BLACK ALLEY has been pushing the art of music to its rhythmic limits. Determined to create a unique musical elixir, BLACK ALLEY has taken the finest ingredients of funk, jazz, soul, and rock to create a their own genre-bending sound called \"Soul Garage\". The band is one, each musician surrendering to the union of sounds, each delivering music from their soul, while they are in dialogue with one another through their instruments. Each member of this septet is essential to the workability and funkability of the unit which is BLACK ALLEY.<\/p> <p>BLACK ALLEY has become one of the most followed, trendsetting and sought-after music groups hailing from the nation's capital. With endorsements from national recording artists such as Grammy Award nominee Raheem DeVaughn, Hip Hop standouts Big KRIT &amp; Wale, and the legendary Sheila E, Black Alley is untouchable, striving to rock harder and heavier each time they unite and contribute to the greater good of music.<\/p> <p>BLACK ALLEY has been featured on various media outlets to include Okayplayer, EarMilk, ThatsEnuff.com, Washington City Paper, and Washington Post. BLACK ALLEY's music catalog contains two critically acclaimed independent releases. In 2012, the band released \"Soul. Swagger. Rock. Sneakers\". The 16-track compilation features original music from Black Alley in collaboration with Raheem DeVaughn, Nicholas Ryan Gant and Phil Ade. Their follow up album, \"Black Alley: Live from the RNR Hotel\" is the live recording project chronicling their powerful performance at their SOLD OUT album release event. Both albums are available on iTunes and BlackAlley.Bandcamp.com. The video for their single \"Artist Prayer\" is in rotation on VH1 Soul and featured on MTV.com.<\/p> <p>BLACK ALLEY has been honored to share the stage with renowned artists like Common, Erykah Badu, Hiatus Kaiyote, Wale, Gin Blossoms, Marsha Ambrosius, Meek Mill, Drake, Raheem DeVaughn, Bilal, Tabi Bonney, Busta Rhymes, Scarface, and Chrisette Michele just to name a few.<\/p> <p>The event is standing room only.<\/p> <p>Tickets are $10 in advance online or $15 at the door.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ticketfly.com\/event\/926037-groove-live-black-alley-hanover\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ticketfly.com\/event\/926037-groove-live-black-alley-hanover\/<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N_bG-D819wM\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N_bG-D819wM<\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>While I was able to bounce back to running quickly after my first child with the goal of a marathon by the time he reached one. I had one failed attempt a month prior to my sons first birthday and a successful finish of a trail marathon a month after my sons first birthday. I ran another marathon at the end of last summer two days before I found out I was pregnant again. So now I'm starting over. My goals less aggressive this time around my weight much higher, and just trying to find a running rhythm. I don't care if your fast or slow. We don't need to run side by side. But we can motivate each other to finish our runs by starting together and meeting again at the finish. My thought is to meet at the lake front in the morning. Jog a loop around the lake then meet at the park after. I can hardly run right now just plodding along, but rebuilding will take time. Let's support each other along the way.<\/p>",

It's a good reason to get out of the house and an easy way to try a variety of different restaurants and pubs in town. An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p>Baroak is located in the front of Loews Hotel on West Street. The theme is casual comfort in a modern ambience with the focus on Belgian food and beers. Baroak has a roomy bar and restaurant area with an impressive selection of Belgian ales and food specialties such as mussels or steak with frites. There is also outdoor seating. So let's give it a try!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Parking is available at Loews Hotel (bring your ticket), on the street, and at the nearby Knighton public garage at West St. and Colonial Ave.<\/p> <p>Full details, menu, and directions are on the Baroak website:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/baroakannapolis.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/baroakannapolis.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/baroakannapolis.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:30 pm to find a good spot at the bar.

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting shorter, the rides have gotten a little shorter, but I'm still trying to maintain about 15 miles. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time.<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back by 8:30, so around 2 1\/2 hours. \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you will probably need it with the days getting shorter. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

        "description": "<p><b>*** If you are attending this practice, please don't forget to sign up on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com\">our website<\/a> by clicking the \"Sign Up\" link at the top. ***<\/b><\/p> <p>The BDBC open practices occur every Wednesday from 6:15 to 7:30 PM and Saturday mornings from 8:30 to 9:30. For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at &lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt; Hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Get there early.\u00a0 I plan to get there by 6:00 at the latest.\u00a0 If you want to be sure you can sit with the group, I suggest getting there before 6:30.\u00a0 If you arrive late, there may not be any space to sit with us.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2. Bring a camp chair and picnic supplies including food and drink.\u00a0 Sharing is optional.\u00a0 Alcohol is technically not allowed on the public pier, but you will see plenty of it and no one seems to care.\u00a0 I suggest being as discrete as possible though.\u00a0 For example, if you bring wine, keep the bottle in a paper bag, pour it into plastic cups, and keep it down low when pouring.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>3. Be prepared to enjoy the evening.\u00a0 The show doesn't start until 7:15 pm, so we'll have a lot of time to sit and picnic.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>4. There is a parking garage at the corner of Fleet St and South Eden St (6 blocks away) that is $3 after 5 pm.\u00a0 If you're earlier than that, the Little Italy parking garage at the corner of S Central Ave and Bank St (7 blocks away) is $4 after 4 pm.\u00a0 Parking at the Marriott garage is $15, and parking on the big garage on Pratt at the intersection of President is $25 or $30.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>5.

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

Our game is not on TV and they can\u2019t broadcast it at 9 on that Thursday anyhow. At least we can be home on Thursday to watch it in any other fashion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Pros:<br\/>No Ravens fans to deal with.<br\/>We can wear our Broncos gear<br\/>They have deals on Yuengling and Wings at 7 PM on Wednesdays.<br\/>Not as packed as it would be on Thursday with Eagles and Ravens both playing.<br\/>Broncos Bombs will be available.<\/p> <p>Cons:<br\/>If you don\u2019t like Wings and Beer.<\/p> <p>I am sorry for the change.

The center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis.<\/p> <p>The sessions will be led by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche. Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book \u201cThe Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha.\u201d He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<\/p> <p>One portion of the session will be dedicated to Lojong, a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of fifty-nine slogans.<\/p> <p>The other part of the session is devoted to the practice of Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion. It is taught that the practice of Chenrezig helps people to cultivate genuine compassion for all sentient beings and ultimately leads us to the realization of enlightenment.\u00a0The meditation consists of chanting a liturgy and visualizing the form of Chenrezig. Although some aspects of the practice may seem foreign, attendees are encouraged to relax, delight in the ritual, and not become preoccupied with doing it \"right.\"<\/p> <p>People of all belief systems and current practitioners of all levels are welcome to attend. Visitors and members can attend on an \u201cas can\u201d basis, attending as much or as little as they are able. Attendees sit on floor cushions or chairs provided at the center<\/p> <p>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 by Tibetan born Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring people peace, happiness, and freedom. The center holds weekly study sessions, short courses, and special events at its Annapolis location.<\/p> <p>Ongoing Wednesday night attendees need not RSVP; we ask that first-time Wednesday night attendees RSVP because there is a limited amount of seating available. \u00a0<\/p> <p>In order to allow the Gampopa Center\u2019s activities to continue and flourish, people are encouraged to make a donation if they are so moved.<\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.gampopacenter.com\/<\/a><\/a> or for more information.<\/p>",

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

But ultimately you are responsible for yourself and must speak up if you have an issue.<\/p> <p>5) Smile and have fun! \u00a0<\/p> <p>*********** AND NOW THE FUN STUFF ***********<\/p> <p>A friend recently introduced me to this trail and it is one of my favorite local trails.\u00a0 There are a lot of smaller hills so you get a nice work out.\u00a0 There are some cool features like man-made valleys left over from train tracks.\u00a0 And the entire hike is along the river so there are many views of the winding Little Gunpowder River.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meet at the Guyton\/Bottom Rd Parking lot. Hike the trail north of the river to Pleasantville rd, and then back on the trail south of the river. Moderate Hike Approximately 5 miles.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll hike at about a 2.5 to 3 mph pace with very few breaks.<\/p> <p><br\/>Please bring a head lamp.\u00a0 There is a good chance we won't finish before it is too dark to hike safely without light.<\/p> <p>Please bring plenty of water.\u00a0 1 Liter is recommended.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The trail is dirt, rocks, roots, and some mud.\u00a0 Plan for appropriate footwear.<\/p> <p>We will step off at 6:45PM.<\/p> <p>Dogs are welcome on this hike but they must be well behaved and on lead at all times.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Long hiking pants are highly recommended!\u00a0<\/p> <p>The group usually grabs a drink afterward at Gunpowder lodge or another nearby restaurant.

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Looking for a unique photography experience? Join the crew of the SS John W Brown as the WWII Liberty Ship is moved from its current berth at Pier 1 on Clinton Street, over to Pier 13 at 4601 Newgate Ave next to the NS Savannah. The SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT is as follows: The SS John W Brown will be shifting around 9am - plus or minus 15 minutes depending on harbor traffic, etc. That means anyone participating in the SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT should park (free) by Pier 13 (by the SAVANNAH) no later than 8:15 am. There will be a free shuttle to bring you over the the BROWN before it departs Pier 1. The photographers will get to ride the ship over to Pier 13. Even though it is a short trip, you'll get to see and have access to the procedures of leaving the pier and then docking at the next one.<\/p> <p><br\/>It is an early morning, with the last shuttle most likely being at 8:15 am, but once the ship is docked at Pier 13, the SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT photographers are welcome to walk around the entire ship and take pictures. The BROWN won't be open to the public until noon, so the crew will be doing some maintenance and 'swabbing the deck' among other things. The SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT photographers are welcome to stay until the public is allowed on at noon, if that is what anyone wants to do. Since your cars already will be at Pier 13, you can leave whenever you like.<\/p> <p><b>The cost for the SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT is $40<\/b>. Everyone will meet in the Saloon to sign the Guest Book and for a short safety briefing and then the fun can start! For questions, the best way to get a quick answer about this event for photographers is to send a private message to the BROWN'S Facebook page.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Here is the link to make your SPECIAL PHOTOSHOOT reservation and buy your ticket: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/calling-all-photographers-tickets-18165533600\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/calling-all-photographers-tickets-18165533600<\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Intimacy and Romantic Relationships<\/p> <p>When we talk about being intimate in a romantic relationship, we often equate it to sexual intimacy. Let's discuss intimacy as a expression of the heart, a process of being truly seen, known, appreciated and connected to our partner. Mehrdad Mizani, who is a self realized teacher who has been interviewed by \"Buddha at the Gas Pump\" \u00a0will lead this discussion:<\/p> <p>Love offering for The Way of Heart will be appreciated.<\/p> <p>6:30 to 7:45 .... Potluck dinner<\/p> <p>8:00 to 8:05 .... Short guided meditation.<\/p> <p>8:05 to 10:00 .... Talk and discussion.<\/p> <p>10:00 to 11:00 .... Music and singing as well as socializing.<\/p> <p>Free parking on the street.<\/p> <p>Feel free to bring house slippers. Blankets will be provided for your comfort.<\/p> <p>\u201cNo matter how much someone wishes to love others, it\u2019s simply not possible without growing the heart.When we understand that only a mature heart can be the source of true and constant love, we realize that it is imperative for us to learn how the heart is meant to grow. No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life \u2013 thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious. As the heart grows, so does the love, and so does our ability to experience lasting happiness in all areas of our lives.\u201d Mehrdad Mizani<\/p> <p>To see a sample of Mehrdad's talk, go to the following links:<a href=\"http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/batgap.com\/mehrdad-mizani\/<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewayofheart<\/a><\/p> <p>Below Mehrdad on Jordan Rich show....delightful<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston.cbslocal.com\/?podcast_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fnyc.podcast.play.it%2Fmedia%2Fd0%2Fd0%2Fd1%2Fd2%2FdI%2FdJ%2FdO%2F12IJO_4.MP3%3Fauthtok%3D5562056298000598828_6ScUksjm73lKMqzU4LwR363IfI&amp;podcast_name=Music+For+The+Soul&amp;podcast_artist=Jordan+Rich&amp;station_id=91&amp;tag=&amp;dcid=CBS.BOSTON<\/a><\/p>",

We are bigger than our meetup presence, so you'll get to meet a good group of people. Starting Location:<br\/>Camden Pub<br\/>647 W. Pratt St.<br\/>Baltimore, MD 21201<\/p> <p>Prelube 6pm (or whenever people want to get things started.)<br\/>Drinking ensues at 7pm.<\/p> <p>BEER SPECIALS ALL DAY LONG:<br\/>domestic drafts $2.50 or $8 for a pitcher<br\/>imported drafts $3.50 or $10 for a pitcher<\/p> <p><br\/>After enjoying a few drinks, we'll head over to the epic \"Save your Soul\" monthly party going on at the Lithuanian Hall, just a few minutes walk from the bar.<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SYSBmore\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SYSBmore<\/a><\/p> <p>If you've never been, it's a fun time!

I hear this month will have a bunch of Otis Redding thrown in just for fun.<\/p> <p>We'll head there sometime around maybe 9:30pm, but we're hashers and tend to play things by ear. If you think you'll come late, let us know and we can try to post an update once we changes locales.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Please Read the Entire Message By RSVPing for this hike, you are accepting the disclaimer at the bottom. Went on a new trail tonight (at least new to me) and thought I'd introduce it to the group.<\/p> <p>The trail winds along the river and gets very narrow in some places, so please be agile and able to keep pace with the group. Not a lot of places to stop and congregate on that part of the trail. Beautiful views along the way. Saw 7 deer this afternoon\/evening while I was scouting it out. Dogs are welcome if they are well behaved and on a leash. Please keep in mind though that part of the trail is very narrow and has an edge down to the water. If your dog is a puller or likes to get under you feet, I'd suggest letting \"Fido\" sit this one out. We'll meet at 9:30 and hit the trail by 9:45. Please be prompt.<\/p> <p>I'm limiting the number of attendees based on the parking at this trail head. If the meetup is full, please check with other attendees to see if you can carpool with them. I'll open it up as many people as want to attend, but need to limit to 10 cars or less.<\/p> <p>**************** DISCLAIMER *********************<\/p> <p>DISCLAIMER: \u201c20s and 30s Hiking Around Maryland (2030HAM)\u201d group and its event\/assistant organizers (the \"Organizers\") are not responsible for your safety.

But perhaps you also wonder how plants might help in this sometimes overwhelming world where it seems nearly all our food is awash in chemical toxins, deficient in nutrients, and generally grown with disrespect. Perhaps you also have concerns about what seems to be an avalanche of chronic medical conditions in our country, like diabetes, depression, auto-immune diseases, allergies, GI problems, and chronic fatigue, and seek answers beyond the pharmacy prescription. Perhaps you have concerns about how our communities can become more truly self-sufficient, and rather than simply sustainable, resilient and regenerative, and your own household less dependent upon purchased products and materials. Perhaps you are also concerned about the daily loss of forests, streams, animals, insects, and plants that seems to be happening at an unimaginable rate everywhere in the world, just to keep our lights on and gas in our tanks. How can we find a way out of this tangle that, frankly, we rely on for almost all our needs? Can we transition, as individuals and communities, towards a more connected and harmonious way of life?<\/p> <p>Questions so big require many ways. This is the plant way. If your heart pulls you to the forest and the sidewalk cracks, then this course can give you the traction to pursue that yearning in its many and diverse applications, and to begin a path of deep apprenticeship to nature itself, for the benefit of the healing of one\u2019s self, one\u2019s community, one\u2019s home-land, and all inner and outer places.<\/p> <p>Foundations in Botany &amp; Plant Taxonomy<br\/>Keeping a Nature Journal<br\/>Identification &amp; Harvesting of Wild Edible Plants<br\/>Cooking Wild Plants<br\/>Language of Field Guides<br\/>Fundamentals of Western Herbal Medicine<br\/>Drying &amp; Preservation of Plant Material for Food &amp; Medicine<br\/>Seasonal Observation for Harvest Inventory<br\/>Understanding Ecosystems<br\/>Indigenous Cultivation Techniques<br\/>When Harvesting Ethics Becomes Ecosystem Participation<br\/>Integrating Wild Plants into the Home Garden, Farm, or Food Forest<br\/>Making Simple Medicines<br\/>Intro to Mushrooms<br\/>First Aid &amp; Hygiene Using Plants<br\/>Plants as Material: Fiber, Dye, Shelter, Fire, Vessels, Tools<br\/>Sensory Exercises &amp; Nature Grounded Meditation<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>At our first Meetup we discussed what we want from this group. \u00a0Our emphasis will be on making friends that get how being a motherless daughter or a daughterless mother impacts our lives. \u00a0So we can start with that connection as a basis for getting together monthly as a group and possibly building individual friendships for comfort and support. \u00a0<\/p> <p>For me, this group is not about grieving or sharing our personal stories. \u00a0I don't want anyone to feel any pressure or vulnerability by attending these meetups. I know that joining a group of strangers is hard for most people. \u00a0Let's find a way to make it worthwhile over the long run.<\/p> <p>And in the short run, we can get some exercise in Severna Park on hopefully a cool sunny Saturday morning. \u00a0If it rains, bring an umbrella. \u00a0If it storms, we could move the event to walking Marley Station Mall. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Please comment if you have suggestions for future events or a better indoor option to walking Marley Station Mall :-)<\/p> <p><br\/>Take care,<\/p> <p>Paula<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Warrior Meditation! These meditation sessions are secular and available to anyone wishing to meditate. All experience levels are welcome. During this session, I'll be offering 4 rounds of 10 to 15 minutes of Shamatha Meditation (also known as Calm Abiding, or Mindfulness meditation). If you are new to meditation and you would like to discuss the technique one on one, please send me a message, and we can schedule time before meditation to go over the technique. After the meditation session we discuss the meditation experience, and also take in select readings from a variety of meditation masters. The focus on most of our reading sessions is about using what we learn in meditation in every day life situations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCheers!<\/p> <p>Terri<\/p>",

My standard answer is the last one I did but if you were to force me to choose, the Magothy would be one of my top three picks. \u00a0It has beautiful scenery, lovely sandy beaches where we swim and at one point some fun choppy water that is perfect for newer paddlers to learn how much fun chop can be. \u00a0Don't worry though, in 20 some paddles over the past 8 to 10 years no one has ever fallen in there. \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Magothy River is one of the hardest Chesapeake Bay tidal\u00a0tributaries to find easy public access to.\u00a0 It is also in my opinion one of the neatest tributaries to paddle.\u00a0 The scenery varies from middle class\u00a0residential neighborhoods at the put in\u00a0where the river is only 20 yards wide to Gibson's Island at the mouth where it enters the Bay.\u00a0 In between you'll find everything from multi-million dollar homes to Dobbin's Island where if we're lucky the sno-ball boat will be hanging out at a beach where the locals gather to swim.\u00a0 Bring a few dollars for a sno-ball\/sno-cone.\u00a0 Make sure to bring your bathing suit as well, we will be hitting a few beaches to help us cool down!<\/p> <p>Please note that 10:00 AM is the \"on the water time\".\u00a0 Please arrive with plenty of time to have your boat and gear ready to launch\u00a0 by then. \u00a0It will take much longer at than usual at this put in so come even earlier than usual.<\/p> <p>Pack a lunch and bring your wheels.\u00a0 Access to this put in can be best described as difficult.\u00a0 If you don't have wheels, don't worry, I'm sure you can borrow some or we will help you carry to the water.\u00a0 At least we don't have to drop the boats down the foundation of an old building like we use to, we just have a longer (but much easier) trail to get the boats to the new put in.\u00a0 This is an adventure that takes some effort to get to the water but everyone who has ever done it with me says it's well worth it. \u00a0You will drive away from the put in at least a little bit exhausted.<\/p> <p>This is an all day adventure.\u00a0 Expect to paddle a minimum of\u00a012 to\u00a014 miles and get back to the take out around 4:30.\u00a0 Don't worry though, we will take plenty of breaks along the way.<\/p> <p>Rental kayaks including a paddle and PFD are available for this paddle at the weekend rate of $55.00.\u00a0 To reserve a rental boat for this paddle simply answer the rental question when you RSVP.<\/p>",

We bring the names of all those we know who are in need of healing to our havan and make our offerings to the fire with those names in our hearts.\u00a0When weather permits, we perform an outdoor havan the first Saturday of each month on the grounds at Ruscombe Mansion Community Health Center. When we cannot be outside, we perform an indoor flower havan in the Community Conference room of the Hill House. We will conclude the havan with 45 minutes of joy-filled devotional singing called Kirtan.<\/p> <p>Other Sundays we meet from 5:00 to 6:15 p.m. in the upstairs conference room at Ruscombe Mansion\u2019s Hill House for our weekly devotional yoga practice (sadhana).<\/p> <p>We invite you to join us on the path of \u201cLiving our Yoga\u201d.<\/p> <p>For more information visit<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiseheartcommunity.org\"> www.wiseheartcommunity.org<\/a> or email Christine Garrison <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the most haunted sites in Pennsylvania, it began as\u00a0the Lawrence County Home for the Aged\u00a0(essentially a \"Poor House\".) Later in the 70's, it was expanded, renovated and was rededicated with a new name, Hill View Manor. Due to bankruptcy, it ceased operating and officially closed in January 2004. During its time, there were numerous suicides, reports of neglect, discrimination practices, etc.\u00a0The cost is currently set at $95.00 for the event and will include a 1.5 hour tour before we are \"locked in\" for the night. A caretaker will be present for assistance during the event. <b>You must\u00a0complete registration by going to hillviewmanor.com web site and click on \"waiver\/registration\" on left hand column and scroll down to see registration form. Fill out form starting with Date: 9\/05\/2015 and complete rest of form, then click on \"submit\" in order to be registered for this event. Bring $95.00 cash or money order along with you as the cost will be collected upon arrival at the site.\u00a0<\/b>By clicking on \"Accommodations\", you can select a local recommended hotel or you may choose another in the area. Comfort Inn Hotel offers a special room rate of $79.00 if you tell them you are visiting Hill View Manor. The rate also includes a free hot breakfast. I'll be booked there. You may either travel alone or carpool. I can carry\u00a05 passengers comfortably in my van and can pick up\/drop off at\u00a0the Moose Lodge (our meeting place). I will be departing from Dundalk Moose Lodge on Saturday at exactly 10:00AM. Hotel check out time is 11:00AM on Sunday and I will be leaving\u00a0promptly at that time. We will eat dinner there at a local restaurant after we arrive at the hotel and get settled in.\u00a0Plan to\u00a0arrive at Hill View Manor at 6:30PM.\u00a0Any cancellation must be done 10 days prior.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

I allow the dogs a 10 minute introduction as people are arriving. This helps the dogs get to know each other. Patapsco State Park entrance fee is $3 per person. Or $75 seasonal per car, good for all state parks. 5120 South Street, Baltimore, MD 21227 GPS gets you to the park entrance. After turning in the park entrance, please pay the entrance fee at the booth. Continue straight ahead (for about 1.5 miles) and when you reach the intersection, take a LEFT (there is not an option to go forward, you can only turn LEFT or right). Follow the road TWO MILES to the \u00a0parking lot at the end of the road past the swinging bridge .

The movie starts at 2:25 pm. I will be in the lobby at 2:00. Adult tickets are $10.21.<\/p> <p>Synopsis of the movie:<\/p> <p>With great jobs, a beautiful daughter (Alena Pitts) and a dream house, the Jordans seem to have it all. Appearances can be deceiving, however, as husband Tony (T.C. Stallings) flirts with temptation and wife Elizabeth (Priscilla Shirer) becomes increasingly bitter, crumbling under the strain of a failing marriage. Their lives take an unexpected turn for the better when Elizabeth meets her newest client, Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie), who encourages the couple to find happiness through prayer.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=the+war+room&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\"><a href=\"http:\/\/warroomthemovie.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/warroomthemovie.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b>Sundays at 5pm - 8pm<\/b><\/p> <p>Buddhism teaches that to find lasting happiness and meaning in our lives we need to follow a spiritual path. To follow this path it is important to be connected with a qualified teacher who can give us personal advice and encouragement, to listen to pure Dharma teachings, and to belong to a strong spiritual community. These enable us to gain deep insight into the meaning of Buddha\u2019s teachings, to maintain a daily meditation practice that is both focused and effective, and to make genuine spiritual progress.<\/p> <p><b>What is the structure?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Prior to each class, students study an assigned reading homework, usually a few pages long.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Each class begins with chanted prayers and guided meditation.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The teacher reads the assigned selection from the book while giving commentary to the text.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The students divide into pairs to discuss the material.\u00a0The teacher and students conclude by deciding what to meditate on in the next class and how to practice during the coming week.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Over the course of time warm friendships develop as students inspire each other, sharing insights and experiences of the spiritual path.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Students sign-up to study for a period of time or for an entire text.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Students agree to try to attend each class, learn the material, and to take a test at the conclusion of the study.<\/p> <p>You are welcome to drop-in to FP at any time to see what it is like. \u00a0After several weeks of sitting in you can sign-up for the program.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/5\/6\/600_438476406.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinmaryland.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/132.jpg\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>We are currently studying\u00a0<b><i>How to Understand the Mind<\/i><\/b> by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.\u00a0This book offers us deep insight into our mind, and shows how an understanding of its nature and functions can be used practically in everyday experience to improve our lives.<\/p> <p><i>Part 1<\/i>\u00a0is a practical guide to developing and maintaining a light, positive mind - showing how to recognize and abandon states of mind that harm us, and to replace them with peaceful and beneficial ones.<\/p> <p><i>Part 2\u00a0<\/i>describes different types of mind in detail, revealing the depth and profundity of the Buddhist understanding of the mind.

Pregens are strongly discouraged!<\/p> <p>After a year of searching and risking life and limb, the agents of the Pathfinder Society have discovered the resting place of the Runelord of Sloth, who has been sequestered from the world at large for 10,000 years awaiting the proper time for his return. Thanks to the efforts of the sinister cult of Lissala, that time is now. In a desperate attempt to defeat this ancient evil once and for all, the Decemvirate sends its best agents, armed with relics found throughout ancient Thassilon, to foil the cult's last-ditch efforts to usher in a new era of tyranny and strife. Will the party succeed in preventing Krune's return to Golarion, or will the Pathfinder Society serve simply as a speed-bump in the runelord's path to domination over the entire region?<\/p>",

        "description": "<p><b><i>The store copy of the game will be focusing on continuing Adventure 2. The Scenarios for Adventure 1 and Adventure 3 are also available at the store and can be run by anyone with a copy of the core card game and the relevant Adventure Deck numbers. If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

We'll do a Spanish-speaking happy hour at Tavern on the Hill, meeting in the back room from 5:30pm onwards. Mixed drinks are $2.50 until 7pm; other good food and drink is available. Come ready to speak Spanish and to enjoy the company of old and new friends. Tip well so that the restaurant keeps asking us back. Everyone is welcome, but the conversation is fully in Spanish, so most participants are intermediate, advanced, or native speakers, plus a few brave advanced beginners.<\/p> <p>Nos vemos pronto!<\/p> <p>Raj<\/p>",

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teaching Schedule:<\/b><\/p> <p>8\/18\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8\/25\u00a0\u00a0Stan<\/p> <p>9\/1 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09\/8\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/22\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9\/29\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>10\/6 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/13\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/20\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/27\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>11\/3\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011\/10\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/17\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11\/24\u00a0\u00a0 Mira<\/p> <p>12\/1\u00a0 Stan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/8\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/15\u00a0 Mira\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\/22\u00a0\u00a0 Stan<\/p> <p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for\u00a030 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting shorter, the rides have gotten a little shorter, but I'm still trying to maintain about 15 miles. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time.<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back by 8:30, so around 2 1\/2 hours. \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you will probably need it with the days getting shorter. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).

Part action film and part detective story, Dirty Wars is a gripping journey into one of the most important and underreported stories of our time. What begins as a report on a deadly U.S. night raid in a remote corner of Afghanistan quickly turns into a global investigation of the secretive and powerful Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). As Scahill digs deeper into the activities of JSOC, he is pulled into a world of covert operations unknown to the public and carried out across the globe by men who do not exist on paper and will never appear before Congress. In military jargon, JSOC teams \"find, fix, and finish\" their targets, who are selected through a secret process. No target is off limits for the \"kill list,\" including U.S. citizens.<\/p> <p>Rotten Tomatoes Scores: 85% \/ 74% IMDB Score: 7.5<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/dirty_wars_2013\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/dirty_wars_2013\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Second Wednesday of each month at 6:30 pm<br\/>Open to the Public; Free of Charge<br\/>Complementary refreshments and snacks.<br\/>Pizza and other food available for purchase on a CASH ONLY basis (small bills appreciated). \u00a0<br\/>Free Street Parking.<br\/>Followed by discussion\u00a0<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Motion pictures that spring from successful plays are unique in that they already have a lot of mileage on them before the cameras even start to roll. If key members of the cast also played opposite each other before live audiences, they haven't just been rehearsing the material, they've been actively getting under the skin of their characters. The script's content and the characters' motivations have been scrutinized in a manner that simply isn't possible while making a conventionally produced film.<\/p> <p>\"Daniel Petrie's\u00a0<b>A Raisin in the Sun<\/b>\u00a0(1961), which is based on Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking play about a proud African-American family, is a case in point. The very intent of the piece was a matter of great debate while it was being performed on Broadway, and its two leads, Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil, were regularly at each other's throats over which approach would work best. The strained mother-son relationship that audiences finally saw on the big screen was the result of considerable tension during the initial phase of the play's successful run. The real-life stand- off between Poitier and McNeil actually grew so heated that, years later, Poitier wrote that he believed the actress \"hated\" him. Nevertheless, the two managed to convey a devastating amount of love for each other, both on stage and in Petrie's acclaimed film version.<\/p> <p>\"Poitier plays Walter Lee Younger, a young black man who stumbles upon an opportunity to improve his standing in a society that's determined to hold him back because of the color of his skin. Walter's strong, dignified mother, Lena (McNeil) has received a $10,000 insurance check after the accidental death of her husband. Intent on taking care of her family in the best way she can, Lena decides to buy a new home in a better neighborhood. But Walter, who has a wife (Ruby Dee) and young son, thinks the money would be best spent on opening a liquor store. Walter's sister, Beneatha (Diana Sands), on the other hand, hopes that the money will be used to help her pay for medical school. This quandary will open up a painful dialogue among the Younger family, which will eventually lead to an unexpected, hard-won form of redemption.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>-- excerpted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcm.com\/this-month\/article\/156507%7C0\/A-Raisin-in-the-Sun.html\">TCMs review<\/a>.<\/p> <p>The short poem from which the play and subsequent film adaptations can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poem\/175884\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/0JUUWLLN03s\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/0JUUWLLN03s<\/a><\/p>",

The Underdark is a subterranean wonderland, a vast and twisted labyrinth where fear reigns. It is the home of horrific monsters that have never seen the light of day. It is here that the dark elf Gromph Baenre, Archmage of Menzoberranzan, casts a foul spell meant to ignite a magical energy that suffuses the Underdark and tears open portals to the demonic Abyss. What steps through surprises even him, and from that moment on, the insanity that pervades the Underdark escalates and threatens to shake the Forgotten Realms to its foundations. Stop the madness before it consumes you!<\/p> <p>Dungeon and Dragons Encounters run every Wednesday from 7pm - 9pm at the Collector's Corner Outpost in Bel Air, Maryland.

When a person is out of balance, life itself seems to be out of balance too. Through the practice of Shaolin Wing Chun, you will learn about putting yourself in a powerful position for personal safety, and a powerful position for life, too - all the while leaving other people with the freedom to make their own choices. You will also learn a four-step communication model for understanding others better. You will laugh, learn, and gain new insight into yourself and others.<\/p> <p><i>Jeremy Roadruck is an Kung Fu Master, an international champion, an international best-selling author and Master NeuroStrategist. He has helped families and kids learn to live and love more, playing the game of life at the highest levels for over 19 years. \u00a0Jeremy also runs a successful martial arts school, and coaches families, individuals and businesses to create win\/win games.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Every month, The Baltimore\/Washington PowerTeam features a special guest speaker delivering content on a variety of topics of interest to high performers like you. Health and fitness, nutrition, finances, relationships, careers, overall mental well-being \u2013 we cover it all. Plus our outstanding peer group offers the support, encouragement \u2013 and accountability \u2013 to help you stay on course toward the life you want to lead. Make plans to join us at our next meeting and help spread the word to others who would benefit from the value we provide!<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Meeting dates are usually the 2nd Wednesday of each month -- or as announced when conflicts arise. (See below)<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Please RSVP to me at '[masked]' if you can make it or contact me at[masked] if you have any questions or concerns.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Guests are always welcome and we'd appreciate a donation of $5 or $10 to help build our charitable budget. In past years, your generosity has helped us feed more than 2,000 local residents at-risk during our Basket Brigade annual food drives. In addition, we've also fed and cared for a number of local homeless people through our Backpacks For The Homeless initiative. Thanks to your help, we'll do even more this year!<\/p> <p><br\/>Rest assured, we strive to give PowerTeam members an outstanding return on their investment of time and effort at every meeting. That means more social and volunteer activities. More personally relevant content. More skill and mastermind sessions. More goal setting. More support and accountability. If you know of a great presenter you'd like to recommend for an upcoming meeting, please let me know \u2013 we're always open to new guests who provide value.<\/p> <p>Mark your calendars for these upcoming 2015 meeting dates:<br\/>October 7 \u2022 November 11<\/p> <p>No December meeting due to Date With Destiny.<br\/>Holiday party plans to be announced.<\/p> <p><br\/>We hope to see you all at a meeting or event soon.

Although a $10 donation is suggested, donations are not required for attendance.<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Each class will include:<\/b> guided meditation, instruction, opportunities to practice, and time for discussion, questions and answers.<\/p> <p><b>When and where:<\/b> We meet every Wednesday from 7:30-9:00 p.m. at Centennial High School, 4300 Centennial Lane, Ellicott City, MD, 21042, room 406. Please arrive early to settle into your seats - we start right at 7:30 p.m. [Note: Class will be canceled on days that the school is closed.]<\/p> <p><b>We practice Insight Meditation<\/b>, a style of meditation that helps the mind attain deeper levels of calm concentration through sustained attention on the breath, then combines this with the crucial aspect of insight through contemplation of the mind and body and all of their changing and impermanent senses, emotions and thoughts. Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p> <p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p> <p><b>Teacher:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stan Eisenstein<\/b>, a high school physics teacher who has been meditating for 25 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004. Stan is a mentor with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington (IMCW) and is a graduate of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute, a two-year certification program with senior Insight teachers Tara Brach, Jonathan Foust, Hugh Byrne, and Pat Coffey. He also teaches Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Stan also earned a Masters of Social Work in 1998.<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Centennial High School Parking (see map below) - September through June:<\/b><\/p> <p>If coming to the school from the South (Route 108) side of Centennial Lane, make a left into the bus loop just as you reach the school. Immediately on your left is a drive to a parking lot on the south\/left side of the school. Park in this lot and follow the signs to room 406.<\/p> <p>If coming to the school from the North (Route 40) side of Centennial Lane, make a right into the bus loop just as you finish passing the school.

There are plenty of chairs, but if you prefer to sit on the floor, which is carpeted, please bring a hard pillow or zafu, since, when meditating, it is recommended that your hips be higher than your knees. If you have never tried sitting on the floor during meditation, it is highly recommended that you try the chair first, then practice sitting on the floor at home until you are comfortable.<\/p> <p>2. If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others. Also, with respect to those who may be allergic, we do not use incense.<\/p> <p>6. The group is not recommended for those under age 13.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to contact Stan Eisenstein at [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Drinking Skeptically is an informal social event designed to promote fellowship and networking among skeptics, critical-thinkers, and like-minded individuals. Drinking Skeptically provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas (and yes, drink) in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. We discuss the issues of the day and whatever else is on our minds. But most of all, we have fun while promoting skepticism, science, and rationality. Don't drink? Don't let that stop you from joining us! Some of the world's most famous skeptics are teetotallers, and we are happy to have you! Remember that drinking skeptically means drinking responsibly. If there's one thing science has taught us, it's the effects of alcohol on the human body. To learn more about Drinking Skeptically see www.drinkingskeptically.org<\/p> <p>The area set aside be the establishment for our group is not wheelchair accessible. The venue has no age restriction for the duration of our event.<\/p> <p>CFI-DC encourages people with disabilities to participate in its programs and activities. If you anticipate needing accommodations or have questions about physical access you may email sdavis [at] centerforinquiry [dot] net in advance of the event.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

FUN!<\/p> <p>However, since each workout program is intentionally different to alleviate boredom and to give you maximum results in minimum time its difficult to describe a \"typical day.\" You can expect some light running, resistance training, obstacle courses, core, body weight, and team training. On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure! These 1 hour workouts are design to provide a total body workout, in half the time!<\/p> <p>Can wait to see you at the next session!<\/p>",

Knowing another person\u2019s internal state, including his\/her thoughts and feelings. Raises epistemological questions of how the knowledge (cognitive empathy) was acquired or validated (empathy accuracy). Explored under human and primate research as \u201ctheory of mind\u201d.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 2. Adopting a posture or matching the neural responses of an observed other. Sometimes referred to as \u201cmotor mimicry\u201d, \u201cphysiological sympathy\u201d, \u201dimitation\u201d, or \u201cfacial empathy\u201d.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 3. Coming to feel as another person feels. Needs to include \u201cemotion catching\u201d from the other, not just parallel matching. Studies of babies crying at the sound of other babies crying is cited here.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 4. Intuiting or projecting oneself into another\u2019s situation. Also know as \u201cprojective empathy\u201d, \u201cimaginative projection\u201d, \u201creenactive empathy\u201d, or \u201caesthetic projection\u201d. Suffers from an assumption that you perceive circumstances and react in the same way as the other.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 5. Imagining how another is thinking and feeling. Derives from your personal knowledge of the person and not the situation.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 6. Imagining how one would think and feel in other\u2019s place. Sometimes referred to as \u201ccognitive role taking\u201d, \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d, or \u201cperspective taking\u201d.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 7. Feeling distress at witnessing another person\u2019s suffering. Important distinction is that the self-oriented feeling of distress is created by the state of the other. People at high risk of emotional overload can have these feelings obscure any truly empathetic concern for the other.<\/p> <p>.\u00a0 8. Feeling for another person who is suffering. Concentration is on empathetic concern for the other person without your own baggage.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Free Reiki Share in Columbia, MD for people new to Reiki or experienced practitioners. This event is open to Reiki Practitioners as well as those simply curious about Reiki. Reiki practitioners of all levels of training, as well as all lineages, often enjoy the opportunity to participate in communal Reiki sessions known as Reiki Shares or Reiki Circles. The sessions give each person a chance to learn from one another as practitioners, as well as benefiting from multiple healing hands during the sessions. At this event we will take turns performing and receiving Reiki. Those that are not Reiki practitioners will be pared up with experienced Reiki practitioners. This is a fun event to be enjoyed by all. Please let me know in your response if you are new to Reiki or a practitioner of some level. For additional information please see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lastinglightreiki.com\/\">www.LastingLightReiki.com<\/a><\/p> <p>Did you know we now offer Holy Fire Reiki Classes?

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes. I once told her she was very loud and didn\u2019t have expression in her delivery, and she really listened.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like any good Toastmaster, Buttigieg is still seeking advice on how to improve. She still asks Alleluia for feedback on her presentations and episodes of the TV show. \u201cI\u2019m honest, and I\u2019ll tell her what I thought the show lacked or what I learned,\u201d says Alleluia.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While Alleluia coaches Buttigieg to improve some public speaking skills, her student is working toward a broader purpose. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel that whether I\u2019m organizing or coaching or speaking, there\u2019s still that element of wanting to pass on the information I know to improve other people\u2019s lives.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The\u00a0Toastmaster\u00a0on Your iPad!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/iPadMag<\/a><\/p> <p>Access the Toastmasters International iPad\u00ae app by following these steps:<\/p> <p>1.

We are the county\u2019s largest club and each year we are active in the most service projects. We raise and give more money than any other club in the county. To date we have contributed $150,000 to the Rotary Foundation.<\/p> <p>Thanks to our club\u2019s ongoing fundraising efforts, we have funded local<br\/>and international projects totaling more than $1 million!<\/p> <p>We are proud to have the most diverse group of multi-cultural Rotarians that includes a wide age range and nearly 40% professional women.<\/p> <p>We take pride in the fact that our meetings are fun, the wit is quick, the guest speakers are interesting, and the work that gets done is the best it can be... all while never forgetting to take time to sit back and have a party, celebrate success and enjoy each others\u2019 company as fellow caring human beings.<br\/>Our club is one of the best ways to lead and stay connected to your community. If you believe that you have a responsibility to give back to the community with a little of your time, energy and expertise, and if you believe that your business should be represented in a group of self-motivated people who believe the same thing, then we hope you will consider visiting our club.

You can also park further north on Charles or on Mt Royal, closer to Penn Station. At 6 or 7pm, you should be able to find parking within a couple blocks of the bar.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Another suggestion from one hasher: If you need a spot (and have nothing valuable in your car), you can go east on Biddle across 83 and the parking is easier. It's not recommend to park East of 83 overnight.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n...Check our fb page for updates: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CharmCityH3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CharmCityH3\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CharmCityH3<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Or better yet, sign up for our email list!

We will be targeting the area of the stream from the Berkshire Community to North Point Road! Volunteers of all ages and abilities are needed! Help us remove the trash before it flows into Back River, the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean! Every piece of trash removed is a small victory to be celebrated!<\/p> <p>We run our cleanups as a family event with plenty of ways for volunteers to participate. We welcome every type of person of every ability level to contribute and assist with the cleanup. Though it is true we will need people to dig out shopping carts and haul trash to the dumpsters, we need people to run water, food, tools, and trash bags (both empty and full) to individuals in the creek. People to sort recyclables from the debris removed. People will be needed to help at registration, setup food and snacks as well as many other less strenuous activities. We are also authorized to sign-off on Community Service and Service Learning Hours for students. The more people we have, the easier the work will be for everyone. We will provide lunch and snacks as well as gloves. A limited number of tools are available for sign-out, but suggest bringing your own if you have them.<\/p> <p>Community Service and Service Learning Hours are available as well!<\/p> <p>We are also looking for photographer\/videographer volunteers to help us document our cleanup as well<br\/>Registration will open at 7:00 am and we will enter the stream at 8:00 am after a brief orientation!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/0\/8\/0\/600_438968320.jpeg\" \/><\/p>",

They are the food and medicine that quite literally surround us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* * * * * * *<\/p> <p>Come on out for one of our monthly plant walks, a great way to learn about edible and medicinal wild plants in-the-field, to verify your plant identification with a local expert, ask questions, and meet other like-minded folks. Each of a season\u2019s foraging walks will take place in a different local landscape and ecosystem, to offer participants a rich exposure to the wide range of local edible plants and mushrooms. Each season also offers new opportunities for encountering edible plants, and for identifying familiar plants in different stages of growth.

Microphones provided are of excellent quality; but if a performer has a favorite mic they would want to use, I\u2019ll try to accommodate them where possible. I just need to know ahead of time \u2013 and you will need to bring your mic clip as well. Also, if a performer requires another type of connection to the sound system other than a guitar, I\u2019d appreciate knowing about it ahead of time. And\u2026if anyone is planning to perform as a group of more than two performers, I\u2019d appreciate receiving a stage plot in advance.

I will share my thoughts on how you can be the sort of player who everyone wants to play with it. It will be an interactive discussion (i.e. you can quibble with my points) and maybe some fun little roleplaying exercises.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This topic has been repeatedly requested and I've been hesitant to discuss it as I don't want anyone thinking there is only one right way way to play roleplaying games (there's not). I try to accept all my players as they are, and advise all GMs to do the same, yet there are a few techniques and tricks practiced by some players that allow them to shine. This is what we're going to discuss I can promise there will be at least a few things that might really improve your experience as a player.\u00a0<\/p> <p>That's the deal. Check the About Us for the FAQ (note the parking situation) and how we run things. Everyone from new and old are welcome to attend, it's a pretty laid-back operation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you have any questions don't hesitate to message me.\u00a0<\/p>",

With Durand-Ruel, they forged an identity and moved from the margins to international fame. Recaptured in this exhibition are the often forgotten setbacks and breakthrough triumphs of Impressionism. Monet\u2019s visions of graceful poplar trees, Renoir\u2019s joyous dance paintings, and Pissarro\u2019s luminous cityscapes showcase the talent recognized by Durand-Ruel.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Go here for tickets to a <i><b>2pm entry<\/b><\/i> before you RSVP (don't wait it will sell out soon):<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philamuseum.org\/exhibitions\/813.html?page=3&amp;ticket=1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.philamuseum.org\/exhibitions\/813.html?page=3&amp;ticket=1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philamuseum.org\/exhibitions\/813.html?page=3&amp;ticket=1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I think there is also an entry cost for the museum itself (unless you are a member), but if we only go in the Impressionist exhibit, I believe we only have to pay for that.

We did not get any interest in the Creative Alliance event, so we thought we'd try something different ( if anyone has any ideas of good events that may interest people, please let us know).We live 4 blocks away from Patterson Park so we thought we would host a party...We will have our grill going as it gets closer to dinner time and will be drinking (and have our big cooler out), so feel free to bring drinks, food etc. ( Booze if fine as long as its in a solo cup) As I said above, we live just a few blocks from the park so bathrooms will be available \u00a0:) \u00a0 Also, if anyone has any BBQ games ( corn hole etc) please bring! We will have Bocche Ball set up!<\/p>",

It's true that the best series have a way of sucking you in, but who always has time for that :P? So instead of getting our toes wet first, let's just jump right in to the second seasons of Magi and Nurarihyon no mago! Both are some of my favorite shows and both have 2 24 episode seasons to their series (so far). While both have excellent first seasons, they are far eclipsed by their second. Links will follow if you need a quick synopsis of the shows. Traditional pot luck affair to be expected, how ever......one little twist! Doing a pizza and ice cream bar this time :P. So save the date, save your appetite and get ready for the second seasons of Magi and Nura!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=7404\">Nurarihyon no Mago<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=9268\">Magi<\/a><\/p>",

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\". That way, we know not to be waiting for you. Thanks.<\/b><\/p> <p>So come join us on Sunday for a brisk walk in the park. It's a great way to clean out the cobwebs and start a Sunday.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Run<\/p> <p>In this\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestselling book, Tyrese Gibson, multi-platinum R&amp;B singer and movie star, and Rev Run of Run-DMC and star of\u00a0Run\u2019s Housepresent a bold, honest, and uncensored look into the male mind.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tyrese and Rev are the unlikeliest of best friends\u2014Rev is married with six kids and Tyrese is a single dad still hesitant to settle down. But after an unexpected argument in which Rev insisted that marriage is forever, and Tyrese countered that you could bail when the sex went bad, the two decided not just to agree to disagree, but to team up and open their debate to a larger audience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Manology\u00a0will help you weed out the cheaters, MANipulators, and pimps from the good men, and it will give you the tools to know if your man is the marrying kind. In \u201c\u00a0Manology\u00a0After Dark,\u201d the guys even give the low-down on what men need in bed, before and after they put a ring on your finger. Some of men\u2019s behavior can\u2019t be changed, but as Tyrese and Rev share, it\u2019s better to face the truth. With Rev\u2019s hard-earned knowledge on how to make a marriage work, and Tyrese\u2019s sometimes uncomfortable but always honest take on the single man\u2019s mindset,\u00a0Manology\u00a0is your one source to help you take control of your love life and truly understand your\u00a0man<\/p> <p>****BRING A MALE FRIEND (RSVP FOR HIM) SO WE CAN HAVE A MALES PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BOOK****<\/p>",

Also learn where you might find some yourself!<\/p> <p>From hot to cold, subtle to bold, spicy and aromatic to floral and sweet, each tea will be unique, and a window into the excitement of a forest\u2019s ever-changing and myriad flavors.\u00a0<br\/>Join us every month!<\/p> <p>Please come prepared to be walking in the woods, through fields and sitting on bare ground.

On some days, you will hike, crawl, lunge, and have a fun time while burning a ton of fat and meeting new people. It's always an adventure!

If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. To participate in Organized play you MUST own your own copy of a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Deck. Each deck is ~$20 and will contain all of the card needed to play a single character class in Organized play, as one of the 4 PC options per class. 2. The RSVP limit is currently set to what we are sure we have space for, but if there is more interest, we can almost certainly make more room. So please sign up for the wait list if you want to play.<\/p> <p>3.

If\u00a0you drive and find parking difficult, try the 1200 block of Bank Street for free street parking. \u00a0Also, the Little Italy Garage is inexpensive and safe. \u00a0It's between Central, Exeter, and Bank streets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>P.P.S.\u00a0Though we meet at the Under Armour Brand Store, we are not affiliated with Under Armour.\u00a0<\/p>",

This is the event you have been waiting for. 10-12 local Maryland Restaurants getting together to fight it out in an effort to bring home the trophy for \"Maryland's Top Crab Cake\". And guess who gets to judge the contest? You. That's right, there will not be any judges... they can be bought off. The attendees at the event will sample the crab cakes and vote for the restaurant that they think is the best.<\/p> <p><br\/>Help Support a Worthy Cause<\/p> <p>A portion of this year's proceeds including all profits on the Silent Auction items will go to support a very worthwhile cause with an incredible story, Alex's Lemonade Stand.<\/p> <p>This is all we had to read from Alex's story and we were hooked on helping her any way we could.<\/p> <p>Alex received a stem cell transplant and informed her mother, \"when I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand.\" She said she wanted to give the money to doctors to allow them to \"help other kids, like they helped me.\" True to her word, she held her first lemonade stand later that year with the help of her older brother and raised an amazing $2,000 for \"her hospital.\"<\/p> <p>We just launched our fundraising page. Please make a small donation online if you can't make it to our event in September. We will have a stand at the event for donations and ice-cold lemonade. Or you can help us raise money by getting your kids involved starting their own Alex's Lemonade Stand and bring the money raised to our Sept. 15th event where we will tally all of the money raised by everyone's efforts, including at the event. Or you could hold the lemonade stand and then donate the money raised on our Fundraising Page.<\/p> <p>Download our Letter of Support from ALSF and meet Alex below in this short video. You can also Read her Whole Story Here.<\/p> <p>TICKETS <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/9U8Rfx\">goo.gl\/9U8Rfx<\/a><\/p>",

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us. Riders with leading rides knowledge are welcomed to help me out leading or sweeping.<\/p> <p>What to bring:<\/p> <p>Plenty of water, helmet (no helmet no ride), your mtb of course!, multi-tool (although you can borrow mine), patch kit, extra tube (make sure it has the same valve you need for your wheel), a snack if you're doing both loops.<\/p> <p>Here at MVD MTB'ers meetup page, we always appreciate any feedback, write a group review!(\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVDMountainBikers\/about\/comments\/?op=all\">Here<\/a> )<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Tuesday is Ollie's Bargain Nite at Camden Yards and Orioles tickets are only $10 each. The game on Sept 15 is against the Red Sox. If the weather is nice, we'll meet at the ballpark and buy tix together in the upper bleachers where we can enjoy the sunset while watching the game. Full details will be posted the Sunday before the game. You need to RSVP at least one day prior to the game to get my cell phone #. Hope you can join us!<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------<\/p> <p>UPDATES:<\/p> <p>Here's some logistical info:<\/p> <p>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Bring $10 cash, meet at 6:20 pm.<\/p> <p>2. I'll email my cell phone number to everyone Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Check your email, and if you don't have it by noon on Tuesday, please contact before 2 pm at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Md\/message\/?recipientId=5312826\"><a href=\"https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/messages\/?new_convo=true&amp;member_id=5312826&amp;name=Allen\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/secure.meetup.com\/messages\/?new_convo=true&amp;member_id=5312826&amp;name=Allen<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>3. We'll meet at 6:20 pm at the memorial at the corner of W. Lee Street and Ravens' Walk (the pedestrian walkway between the Ravens' and Orioles' stadiums). The memorial is inscribed \"Time Will Not Dim the Glory of Their Deeds\". The exact location is marked by the red (or green) thingy on this map:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\"><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?daddr=39.28206,-76.6207&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=17&amp;t=h<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>4. At 6:30 pm sharp, we'll walk up to the ticket window together and buy tickets.\u00a0 Please bring $10 in CASH to pay for your ticket.<\/p> <p>5. If you're running late, call me on my cell before 6:30 pm and we'll either wait a few minutes for you, or we'll head in and let you know where we're sitting.<\/p> <p>6. You can park at the stadium for $8.\u00a0 Again, bring cash.<\/p> <p>7. If anyone would like to ride up with me from the Laurel\/Columbia area, please let me know.\u00a0 I'm going to be leaving as soon after 5 pm as possible--definitely no later than 5:15.<\/p> <p>8. You're allowed to bring your own water, soda and snacks into the stadium. Those are often nice to have.<\/p> <p>9. A baseball cap is a good idea. It shields your eyes from the overhead field lights and makes it easier to see.<\/p> <p>10. The long term forecast is sunny and hot Tuesday with a small chance of scattered showers.\u00a0 We'll get tickets in the shade and under the roof so any sun or passing rain won't bother us :-).<\/p> <p>See everyone Tuesday nite!<\/p>",

The book details the unique adventures and conflicts the author faces, from dealing with the damage caused by development of the land or excessive tourism, to discovering a dead body. However Desert Solitaire is not just a collection of one man\u2019s stories, the book is also a philosophical memoir, full of Abbey\u2019s reflections on the desert as a paradox, at once beautiful and liberating, but also isolating and cruel.

You place out the tiles in runs (3 or more consecutive numbers of the same color, e.g. blue 6, 7, 8) or sets (3 or more of the same number, all of different colors, e.g. red 3, blue 3, black 3).\u00a0 If you don't have all of the tiles you need, you can borrow some by rearranging the tiles that have already been placed.\u00a0 It's all good, as long as you can redistribute the leftover tiles into valid sets or runs. The first person to clear their tray wins.<\/p> <p>Phase 10 is a card game,\u00a0similar to Rummy.\u00a0 It involves trying to complete a set of 10 phases, one at a time before your opponents do.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0\n\u00a0If you have either of these games, please bring them.<br\/>\u00a0\nAs always, please remember to bring your $1 so we can pay meetup.com.\u00a0<\/p>",

You have developed and shift in your thinking to see a new world view.<\/p> <p>For any questions:<\/p> <p>Email: [masked]<\/p>",

An added attraction is that happy hour menus at most places make the drinks and food more affordable.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special happy hour menus and prices are typically only available in the bar area, so that's where we'll meet to enjoy a good time. As a general rule, our SHR group prefers gathering in the bar area where we can freely mingle and get separate checks with no hassles about group ordering. We also receive much better service by ordering and paying directly at the bar.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/d\/3\/600_439741747.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Visiting outdoor bars is part of enjoying the warm weather season in Annapolis. Sam's on the Waterfront restaurant is located at the Chesapeake Harbour marina off Edgewood Rd. Chesapeake Harbour is a gated community, so you'll need to stop at the gate, tell them you're going to Sam's, and they'll show you the way. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Sam's has a nice outdoor waterside bar on the dock that's perfect for refreshments and bar food. The wings and drink specials are always good, and our SHR group has enjoyed going there several times. Full details and directions are available on Yelp:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sams-on-the-waterfront-annapolis\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sams-on-the-waterfront-annapolis\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sams-on-the-waterfront-annapolis<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'll arrive by 5:00 pm to hopefully find a good spot in the bar area.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!<\/p>",

Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. \u00a0Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you, but please also survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). \u00a0Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. \u00a0A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. \u00a0This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. \u00a0This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. \u00a0We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0With days getting shorter, the rides have gotten a little shorter, but I'm still trying to maintain about 15 miles. \u00a0Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. \u00a0I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time.<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back by 8:30, so around 2 1\/2 hours. \u00a0This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. \u00a0As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. \u00a0Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). \u00a0Bring a light, as you will probably need it with the days getting shorter. \u00a0There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. \u00a0Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens. \u00a0Here is a link to one: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006Y1FK18\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Cheap 1000 lumen bike light<\/a>&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B006QQX3C4\/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3FJIG6WZ09712&amp;coliid=I15GIMB04YOTYI\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>Weather:<\/b> Shine Only (there will undoubtedly be some mud, but no ride if it\u2019s raining or the trails are too muddy).
