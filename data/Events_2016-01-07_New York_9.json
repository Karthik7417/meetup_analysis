What makes it even tougher is if you don't have a reliable wing woman to help navigate the NYC single scene with. Every single woman needs a dependable wing woman, equally motivated to go out with you to happy hours, clubs, bars, parties and everything else as single women we don't want to hit \"solo.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nMeet 10-30 other \"single and fabulous\" women in their 30s and 40s at our \"speed\" networking event over drink specials.

Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.
