YES is for you if: You often wish you could be happy all the time but you aren't sure how to. You want to learn how to love yourself deeply no matter what. You've wanted to try coaching but haven't because of time commitment, money, or any other blocks. You have a big dream but you're afraid to act.

Yes, this includes requests or propositions to stud, sell or buy a dog. Any mention of things eluding to such, whether at the Meetups or on our webpage, will be grounds for removal from the group. 2) This group is comprised of many FRIENDLY, non-dominant or aggressive Frenchies, and we want to keep it that way. Thus while this group is meant for socializing dogs and we do understand that some who are new to the group, or being around other dogs in general, may be overwhelmed at first, we will not tolerate a continual over-aggressor and said party will be asked respectfully to refrain from coming again until their dog is more comfortable in larger-scale situations. 3) Each owner is responsible for the dog(s) they bring. This means you are to be watching, aware and on top of YOUR dog's behavior and actions at all times, specifically their attitudes and cleanliness. While we encourage socializing amongst the human participants, this is ultimately about the dogs' enjoyment, and parents must be steadfast in the monitoring of their personal dogs during play time to make sure that everything is going smoothly and that all dogs are having fun. As stated, over-aggressors will not be tolerated; this includes dogs who hump\/mount\/chase excessively or with aggression, instigate issues with others or actually aggressively bark at, growl or bite other dogs. Additionally, accidents (poop, pee, vomit or otherwise) are the responsibility of each owner to clean up immediately. We often times meet at indoor locations as well as nice community dog parks where we, the North Arlington French Bulldogs Meetup, are responsible for picking up after ourselves in order to be eligible to utilize the spaces. YOU are responsible for cleaning up after your dog promptly, no one else! 4) We require that the health of the dogs who attend Meetups be of the highest standard!! No puppies under the age of 5 months are allowed due to their compromised immune systems and ability to carry and pass germs along more readily than older dogs. Additionally, dogs are not welcome to attend Meetup if their vaccinations are not current (all dogs should be wearing collar and tags for verification) and up to date for their age, if they are in Heat or showing any signs of being close to a breeding cycle, if they've been experiencing or exposed to ANY SIGNS of illness within the last week, or if there are any open sores present on the day of the gathering. 5) Meetups are generally held once a month at varying locations in and around North Arlington, NJ. We do our best to meet in convenient spots, and we are always looking for suggestions of large places our members would like to see us go. Indoor locations are generally only utilized if necessary per the weather, and we try to choose dog parks based on their level of public activity\/cleanliness\/safety as well as the ability to separate small and large breeds from each other. Please understand that this group is solely facilitated by Frenchie owners; no professional trainers or organizers host these events, so while we do our best to keep everything in line and running smoothly, there are times when we may not be able to meet due to extenuating circumstances and\/or things happen that are out of our control. We strive to avoid those times, but we appreciate your flexibility and willingness to go with the flow. 6) Membership to the North Arlington French Bulldogs costs $12 per year. This fee goes towards the rental of any indoor spaces we may meet at throughout the year as well as covering the fee that Meetup.com charges us to use this site for facilitation of the group. In the event that our fund is running low I will ask members to help contribute to the cost of the indoor meetups. Any overage after all monies are collected, will be donated to the French Bulldog Rescue Network for their efforts to rescue and rehabilitate French Bulldogs throughout North America who aren't as lucky as ours. 7) Awesome members make for awesome Meetups!! We are happy to have all who are happy to abide by the rules and be upstanding members of the group!!

It's a forum for sharing and discussing new research and exciting advances in theoretical physics and computational biology. Several approaches to unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity, influenced in part by the discovery of the holographic principle, prompt us to break up spacetime itself into chucks (the same way we break down matter into particles). Matter and the laws of physics, then, emerge from the changing of the states of these chunks based on the states of neighboring chunks, as though our universe is one large cellular automaton - a computer program. I recommend the paper by Tommaso Bolognesi entitled \"Algorithmic Causal Sets for a Computational Spacetime,\" which can be found in Hector Zenil's collection of essays \"A Computable Universe: Understanding and Exploring Nature as Computation.\" There's also a TV program named Closer to Truth that dedicates some episodes to exploring information as the fundamental reality and the universe as a computation. But wait, I thought matter and energy are fundamental!?! Well, \"Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement...\" of matter and energy. There is a proof by contradiction that everything (matter, mind, and processes) is composed of information, and there is another proof by contradiction that information cannot be reduced to matter. If information is the fundamental reality and the complexity of physics emerges from simplicity, it prompts a scientific paradigm shift from a top-down to a bottom-up understanding of nature. In the study of the mind, Tononi's Integrated Information Theory is one example of an approach to resolve the hard problem of consciousness using information as the fundamental ingredient. I recommend the paper \"Is Consciousness Computable? Quantifying Integrated Information Using Algorithmic Information Theory.\" Gregory Chaitlin's metabiology is an interesting attempt to model evolution in the framework of algorithmic information theory. Let's see if we can pull together the pieces of the puzzle of existence and evolution.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/highres_442347205.jpeg","photo_id":442347205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/600_442347205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/thumb_442347205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":153712592,"name":"Dan"},"members":32,"name":"Digital Philosophy, Consciousness, and Quantum Gravity","id":18962475,"state":"NY","urlname":"Digital-Philosophy-Consciousness-and-Quantum-Gravity","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"combinatorial hierarchies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Fresh Meadows","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443075040000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"sensual-and-erotic-education","name":"Sensual and Erotic Education","id":20593},{"urlkey":"pornography","name":"Pornography","id":61951},{"urlkey":"pornography-addiction","name":"Pornography Addiction","id":78793},{"urlkey":"celebrate-sensuality","name":"Sensuality","id":93385}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pornandpizza\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is inspired by the famous Yale group, Porn and Chicken.

As women always on the move we are constantly running from place to place, this form of networking happens while shopping or understanding how transition your make-up from day to night, or accomplishing a fitness goal. I am well connected through out NYC to host several events of this nature. However, I want this to be an open platform for women with all different skill sets to reach out and create new and innovative event.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting? Each meeting will consist of a forum providing compliance advice for a specific aspect of the technology sector (e.g. WCAG guidelines for website\/app design, payment systems compliance issues, cryptocurrency issues, etc...), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A for items to be discussed either at that meeting or answered in the following meeting. The meetings will start in November and will be held on a monthly basis. We look forward to seeing you there!

I am a father of an amazing 16 month old boy who is the center of my universe. I work Mon-Fri, dusk till dawn saving for all the wonderful things we want to provide our son with. This leaves me little time to connect with other parents and to meet other parents that share the same family focused lifestyle that we live. Now we all know how it goes...Lots of friends and going out and social time before the baby...but after the baby comes, you just don't have the time to do all of that anymore and those friends without kids seem to drift away slowly but surely...So this is the reason I am starting this group. I'm a dad who loves football (especially fantasy football and watching football on Sundays), loves going out to eat, loves dressing my son up as cute as possible to get the most people to compliment him as possible when I take him out (admit it, we all do it!). I'm looking to meetup with easy going people who will connect with the much more simplistic lifestyle of having kids but still want to meet up and have fun once every week or two. Kids are welcome for any meetups, I mean heck, that's the whole purpose I'm posting this is because we are parents! We can meet at parks, restaurants, houses, etc... Essentially wherever people feel will be best. Just a dad, looking to connect with other dads. Sunday football outings with or without the kids would definitely be a plus! :)","lon":-73.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193235116,"name":"Joseph Perez"},"members":4,"name":"Forest Hills Dads Meetup","id":18967515,"state":"NY","urlname":"Forest-Hills-Dads-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dads having fun with other dads"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Metuchen","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443213006000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"sleepdisorders","name":"Sleeping Disorder","id":1926},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"solve-sleep-problems","name":"Solve Sleep Problems","id":56199},{"urlkey":"sleep","name":"Sleep","id":119381},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating-for-energy-and-good-health","name":"Healthy Eating For Energy and Good Health","id":444332}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Central-Jersey-Sleep-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a support group for people who find it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Wouldn't it be nice to add a romantic significant other to that scenario waiting with a hug and kiss? So maybe the couch gets a little smaller with a third party, and in this case a fourth in what I'm proposing, but you might just come to love it... And maybe your dogs will like each other and be happier! They get lonely too. Especially all day. Think of it this way- if you come to this meetup, you already have something in common. You both love your dog, and are compassionate enough to take time out of your busy life to take your furry friend to a park to live it up... even if you are exhausted. And despite your exhaustion, you know your dog will make you smile and laugh taunting you until you play, giving you that infamous pleading face if you don't. Use that connection to launch a connection with someone else. You obviously learned unconditional love from your dog by now, and the meaning of loyalty and caring for each other always. So come to the meetup and find someone who understands too, and is ready to try it with a human.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2952044,"name":"Vanessa"},"members":1,"name":"Professional Singles and their Dogs Play Date!

We welcome all levels of players from beginners to professional coaches to join us and serve each other.\n\nTo facilitate event organizing, please observe the following guidelines:\n\nAll members must post a face recognizable picture on the profile page.\nAnyone can request to be an Event Organizer (EO) as long as he\/she has been active with the group. While being \"active\" is subjective, I would say a good attendance of 20+ without \"no-show\" is a good indication.\nAs EO, one would reserve the court, post and host the event. He can also place all RSVP on wait list from which the EO would pick out the final tennists before the event date.\nAs a courtesy to the EO and members on waiting list, please change RSVP well in advance. The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.\nEO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.\nEO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.\nFrom time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.\nMembers' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.\nProfessional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.\nFrom time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game. Professionals can take advantage of such events to promote their services.\nIf you haven\u2019t notice, we call ourselves Tennist and our Headline is \u201cCome serve with Tennis Meetup!\u201d\nDisclaimer: New York Tennis Meetup is an amateur platform that welcomes all tennis players. By joining our events, all participants are deemed to have agreed to the terms and conditions contained in this disclaimer, and agreed to exonerate the organizers and any other participants in the games from any liabilities, claims, including but not limited to liabilities and claims as a result of any injuries or deaths or damages arising thereof.

Let's explore this important new text together from the beginning and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers. Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week. It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of A Course in Miracles, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. A COURSE OF LOVE builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth. Classes are $20 and class cards are available. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. Read more... You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here: http:\/\/crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday ACIM class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing). He produces arts\/cultural\/educational events at the Center, leads Inner Vision Workouts, and works as a CRS Healer and teacher of A Course in Miracles. In addition to studying ACIM with Yasuko Kasaki since 2003, he studied the Spiritual Psychology of Acting with London-based teacher John Osborne Hughes and Keith Johnstone-based Improvisation with the late Gloria Maddox.

I'm looking to put together a small-sized compatible group that would enjoy playing together once every week or two at the local public golf courses. By small-sized I mean eight or so people so we can have two foursomes. But if more people are interested then sure, we can expand. Although I'm mostly thinking of a group of guys playing golf, women would be welcome. My wife will likely join us sometimes also. Your spouse (or a golfing buddy) would be welcome also as space allows. As implied, this is not a singles meetup type of event. It's for people who enjoy playing golf and enjoy it that much more when playing with others. If you can say \"yes\" to most of these questions then we could be a pretty compatible group: 1. You're a young senior ... for myself I just turned 62. While \"young senior\" is not a \"have to have\" criteria to join decide for yourself if you think you would get along with such a group. 2. You're available during weekdays to play. ... Wanted so we can get cheaper rates. Being retired or semi-retired helps. Note: but we might play some on weekends also. 3. You're nearby (within 7 or so miles of Cranford). ... This ties in with keeping the group small. 4. You play in the area. ... As for me, I play at these public courses: Hyatt Hills, Ashbrook, Galloping Hills, and the Summit Muni (a par 3 course). Other courses are welcome if you have one you like. I also play at a private club but my limited membership makes it costly to play at (and only allows 3 guests at a time anyway). 5. You can already play golf. You can be poor, mediocre, or quite good. ... So you know, my handicap is a 26. Yeah, that's on the high side but I'm getting better. 6. You follow good golf etiquette. ... For example, you keep up your pace of play. Also, you know and follow the rules (but if you need a mulligan please take it). 7. Good attitude. ...

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give. This work demands of us at all times a deepened understanding and an increased ability to penetrate to new levels of consciousness so lifting humanity as a whole. http:\/\/www.lucistrust.org\/en\/service_activities\/start_a_meditation_group\/resource_center","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193144989,"name":"Lucis Trust"},"members":1,"name":"New York Meditation as a Way of Life","id":18986696,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-as-a-Way-of-Life","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443733774000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"drinking","name":"Drinking","id":15546},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"new-york","name":"New York","id":18312},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-In-Town-Lets-go-Out\/","rating":0,"description":"A group for anyone interested in enjoying what life has to offer.
