I have moderate scoliosis, and I decided to start one. If alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have NA, and there are support groups for a slew of other types of mental health and health issues, it's about time scoliosis got a support group of its own. We suffer too, don't we? Doesn't our condition impact our lives in significant ways, mentally and physically?<\/p>\n<p>The only place where I read about the spiritual-psychological aspect of scoliosis was in a text written by Katharina Schroth, who founded the Schroth Method of scoliosis treatment in the early 20th Century (<a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/17<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>\"Curvature of the spine, or scoliosis, is a precarious formal defect in terms of health, appearance, and the spiritual-psychological aspect. When attempting to help a scoliotic with this defect, we must not view the matter primarily from the mechanical standpoint, namely the malfunctioning body. For we have before us not a mechanical structure of bony levers and the muscles that move them, but rather an unfortunate person who has lost the form originally created for her and who cannot restore it by herself. With all scoliotic people, the cause probably lies partly in the mental realm. Envision what the expression \"not in good form\" means. Imagine the mental state of a child scolded by his mother. The psychic depression and loss of equilibrium are immediately visible in his abnormal bodily form. How wonderful the form of a little child's body is! What a victorious, natural, matter-of-fact nature he has in the representation of his Self, and in every movement and in all of his life statements.<\/p>\n<p>However, let us observe a school class three or four years later. What has happened to these children? Almost all are missing their original sense of complete, untroubled comfort within. Many children have pronounced signs of suffering in their faces, and their depressed mental state finds expression in their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Why do gymnastic attempts to erect such a troubled child often fail completely? It is because they approach the child much too mechanically, much too much in the form of exercises, without first becoming familiar with his life difficulties, his unfulfilled needs, which to the adult may seem trivial. Straightening of the external person will only succeed when we can erect the inner person, open an avenue of hope, and allow him to breathe a sigh of relief.\" (Lehnert-Schroth, Christa, P.T. Three-Dimensional Treatment for Scoliosis, page 5)<\/p>\n<p>Also, I must credit this video for inspiring me to move forward with this group: <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Physical therapists can't help us deal with the mental issues that are getting in the way of our exercises, which in many cases renders the exercises useless. I believe a support group made up of other people with scoliosis is a crucial way of trying to address the psycho-spiritual contributors\u00a0of this condition.<\/p>","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12666154,"name":"Evelyn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/highres_112494562.jpeg","photo_id":112494562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/member_112494562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/5\/2\/2\/thumb_112494562.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Scoliosis Support Group","id":17994992,"state":"NY","urlname":"Scoliosis-Support-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1414861657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183},{"urlkey":"italian","name":"Italian Language","id":184},{"urlkey":"french","name":"French Language","id":185},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"italian-culture","name":"Italian Culture","id":15028},{"urlkey":"spanish-culture","name":"Spanish Culture","id":19169},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"italian-lessons","name":"Italian Lessons","id":29637},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-italian","name":"Learn to Speak Italian","id":45489},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"learning-spanish","name":"Learning Spanish","id":50595},{"urlkey":"spanish-lessons","name":"Spanish lessons","id":51717},{"urlkey":"french-lessons","name":"French Lessons","id":82861}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Learn-to-Speak-FRENCH-ITALIAN-SPANISH-in-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in learning FRENCH, ITALIAN, and SPANISH language and culture in NYC!

Our objective is to present public concerts of Songs from India - different regions and languages, in a chorus style, sprinkled with solos. We generally stay away from Bollywood songs. In concerts, we employ live orchestra for accompaniment. Our orchestra is a collection of Indian and Western instruments. While our music is authentically Indian, our performance is a bit fusion in style. Our presentation style is formal and professional, sort of like that of the New York Philharmonic in Lincoln Center.<\/p>\n<p> Our recent concert on October 4, 2015, consisted of 12 non-Bollywood songs from different regions of India. It was a spectacular success and received 10+ minutes spontaneous standing ovation. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are always looking for new singers to join us. If you would like to sing with us or play ANY Indian instrument reasonably well, please contact us. We are located in Hastings on Hudson, NY. <br><\/p>\n<p>We do expect long term commitment for rehearsals and performance.

China, as the world\u2019s biggest exporter, and the United States, as the world\u2019s biggest importer, are two major trade players. However, due to language and geographical issues, there still has been a gap between U.S. and China\u2019s businessmen\/businesswomen in terms of information symmetry and efficiency of resource integration. <\/p>\n<p>We understand that the businessmen\/businesswomen in the U.S. are eager to find accessible sources of high quality products with lower cost, and at the same time, a number of giant manufacturers in China are looking for opportunities to expand their global sales networks and sell their products in a more cost-efficient way.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Our Mission:<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>We believe that the trade between both sides could be organized in a more ACCESSIBLE and EFFICIENT way, and therefore we set up this meet up to help you find your best business partners from China.

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4. Meetings will be held in Manhattan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Sample articles<\/b><br>\n\n List of abbreviations:<br>\n\n NYT - New Your Times<br>\n\n WSJ \u2013 Wall Street Journal<br>\n\n FT \u2013 Financial Times<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 0.\u00a0The Truth About Our Libertarian Age By Mark Lilla -\u00a0newrepublic.com June 17, 2014<br>\n\n 1.

Our focus is to draw the male figure and depict masculinity in an open-minded, sex-positive nature&nbsp;not found in traditional drawing groups. When both the model and the artist are naked, they are on equal footing, encouraging openness and camaraderie. Sex or touching is not allowed except as part of a pose; some of which are homoerotic; please read the rules and FAQ below.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>CRITERIA TO JOIN THIS GROUP:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 individuals who present themselves with primarily masculine or male features, including transgendered men<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 visual artist (mandatory, any level from beginner to experienced), all non-smelly mediums except photography.

If you do a sexual pose, talk it through with your partner. Poses are not an excuse to have sex with an unwilling partner. Don\u2019t assume. It\u2019s always okay to say no or stop. If you don\u2019t have CLEAR consent, don\u2019t get sexual. <\/p>\n<p>A little movement is okay, but come back to the same position and hold it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>PRIORITY RSVP AND \"NO-SHOW\" POLICY:<\/p>\n<p>To reward regular attendance and reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d, we have a priority RSVP system similar to airline priority seating.

Use the link in the event description. Special sessions may have a higher fee.<\/p>\n<p>Arrive 15-30 minutes before event start time. Everyone sets up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Overall session time is 3 hours. It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with a little social time before and breaks during. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>Bring all your own materials, drawing boards, portable easels, etc. Most guys draw on pads on their laps. There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>Bring a towel or sit on your shirt. Please be hygienic.<\/p>\n<p>Be mindful of your stuff (wallet, phone, etc). MNDGNY or the venues are not responsible for lost or stolen items.<\/p>\n<p>Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please put out some of your drawings so others can see them. If you\u2019re working in a notebook, show your drawings to the person taking photographs so he can take some snapshots. Take your drawings home with you!<\/p>\n<p>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<\/p> \n<p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW; IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION? There is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. From time to time, there will be special classes with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A NAKED EVENT BEFORE. WHAT'S IT LIKE?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. At studio venues, there are usually about 15-20 artists, at private homes about 10 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed after checking in and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, the poses can be sexual. <\/p>\n<p>I'VE NEVER POSED BEFORE. Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We'll help you out if you want, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. There is a sign-up sheet for poses with about 12-15 posing slots per session (varying lengths 5-20 minutes) so not everyone poses at each session. Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IS THIS A GAY GROUP?&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexual so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT'S THE SEXUAL ENERGY OF THE GROUP LIKE?&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies depending on who shows up and is often higher at private homes but the focus is always on the art. This is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT IF I GET AN ERECTION?&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.<\/p>\n<p>WHO KEEPS THE DRAWINGS THAT I POSED FOR?&nbsp;Each artist keeps his own drawings. The model can ask for\/trade\/buy other artists' drawings.<\/p>\n<p>Organized by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shungaboy\">Shungaboy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our social media:<\/p>\n<p>Our Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.com...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MNDGNY\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/M...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Facebook Page:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mndgny\">https:\/\/www.facebook....<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our Wordpress Blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mndgny.wordpress.com\/\">http:\/\/mndgny.wordpre...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Updated 1\/20\/2016<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/highres_432143748.jpeg","photo_id":432143748,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/600_432143748.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/c\/4\/thumb_432143748.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":16687501,"name":"Shungaboy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/highres_212791212.jpeg","photo_id":212791212,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/member_212791212.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/e\/c\/thumb_212791212.jpeg"}},"members":339,"name":"Men's Naked Drawing Group NY","id":18232572,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mens-Naked-Drawing-Group-NY","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Naked Artists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1417727340000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"kali","name":"Kali","id":10041},{"urlkey":"mixed-martial-arts","name":"Mixed Martial Arts","id":15514},{"urlkey":"knife-fighting","name":"Knife Fighting","id":15570},{"urlkey":"japanese-martial-arts","name":"Japanese Martial Arts","id":18460},{"urlkey":"filipino-martial-arts","name":"Filipino Martial Arts","id":19466},{"urlkey":"combat","name":"Combat","id":21208},{"urlkey":"close-quarter-combat","name":"Close Quarter Combat","id":24042},{"urlkey":"stick-fighting","name":"Stick Fighting","id":24043},{"urlkey":"fencing-archery-and-medieval-martial-arts","name":"Fencing, Archery and Medieval Martial Arts","id":26753},{"urlkey":"internal-martial-arts","name":"Internal Martial Arts","id":28022},{"urlkey":"mma-mixed-martial-arts","name":"MMA Mixed Martial Arts","id":35023},{"urlkey":"chinese-martial-arts","name":"Chinese Martial Arts","id":38972},{"urlkey":"knife-defense","name":"Knife Defense","id":92715}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Martial-Arts-Dodgeball-Tennis-Paddle-Ball-VolleyBall\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>When the schedule says a start time it doesn't mean you have to be there at the specified start time. you can arrange to come at any point from start time to 8 pm.

This is accomplished through the following types of monthly events: - Writing Workshops: We bring in industry professionals for hands-on sessions where you can learn new techniques and skills to improve your work. - Feedback Opportunities and Pitching Practice: You will have many opportunities to present in front of your peers in order to gain exposure and gather feedback. - Networking Events: Meet other writers, actors, directors, producers, and other industry professionals to explore and form new collaborations. - Film Screenings: We curate films based on the group's interest to stimulate and facilitate group discussion and learning. - Guest Speaker Series: We invite active industry professionals who will share their experiences, insights, and advice.

The vision is that by establishing an environment that encourages innovative thinking and provides supportive engagement would not only enhance learning (study groups) but would also allow every member the ability to collaborate and network with forward-thinking individuals, mentors, technology professionals and potentially meet investors.<\/p>","lon":-73.8399963379,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":123483632,"name":"Bob Garner","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/f\/a\/highres_242666618.jpeg","photo_id":242666618,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/f\/a\/member_242666618.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/f\/a\/thumb_242666618.jpeg"}},"members":63,"name":"Westchester Technology Network","id":18243618,"state":"NY","urlname":"Westchester-Technology-Network","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.9099998474,"who":"Participants"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418178932000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"graphicdesign","name":"Graphic Design","id":781},{"urlkey":"fashionista","name":"Fashionista","id":918},{"urlkey":"art","name":"Live Music","id":1502},{"urlkey":"homedecorating","name":"Home Decorating","id":1674},{"urlkey":"fashion","name":"Fashion Industry","id":1924},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"shopping","name":"Shopping","id":9349},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fashion-and-style","name":"Fashion and Style","id":16575},{"urlkey":"fashion-photography","name":"Fashion Photography","id":17885},{"urlkey":"fashion-design","name":"Fashion Design","id":21437},{"urlkey":"fashion-shows","name":"Fashion Shows","id":27075},{"urlkey":"makeup-and-fashion","name":"Makeup and Fashion","id":45153},{"urlkey":"interior-decorating","name":"Interior Decorating","id":46026},{"urlkey":"polyvore","name":"Polyvore","id":1503957}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Polyvore-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Share Polyvore stories, build greater friendships, exchange tips and tricks and to spend time with people who have similar interest.

If you're an experienced actor, skilled screen writer, or an editor looking to experiment like this, please join.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3404004,"name":"Van Nguyen","photo":{"photo_id":138658572,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/c\/c\/member_138658572.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/4\/c\/c\/thumb_138658572.jpeg"}},"members":96,"name":"NYC make a film scene during your lunch break","id":18277104,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-lunch-break","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cutrushers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edison","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419721756000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"ebizowners","name":"E-Business Owners","id":1330},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"careers","name":"Career","id":22888},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TEACHANDLEARNCNJ\/","rating":4.96,"description":"<p><b>Welcome to the Central NJ chapter of Teach and Learn Networking!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Events - Community - Consulting<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs, business professionals, we know how you feel about networking. <b>It sucks.<\/b> Unless there's free wine involved, walking up to strangers and talking about work (after you've worked all day) sounds like torture.<\/p>\n<p><i>Does a professional networking event have to feel like a middle school dance?<\/i> <b>No.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Teach and Learn Networking believes in curating environments where sharing ideas, resources, and network power feels natural.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>How do we do that?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Good question.

I adore great films and even more, sharing my opinions, hearing other's opinions and having lively discussions about movies. I would love to gather together other movie buffs to see movies in a theater and then do brunch, lunch or dinners where we talk about the film and just have fun. Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient. See you at the movies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: I appreciate yearly dues of $5.00 which are given to me at first meetup.<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and do not show up and do not notify us, you will be removed.

I am, having returned to Brooklyn after a decade in Queens! Perhaps, like me, you do a lot in Manhattan, but wish you could also just hang around the neighborhood with new friends.

While the focus is here in Bay Ridge, we venture off to venues in other parts of Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn Museum and the Heights Players.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production.

To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you\u2019ll remain on the RSVP list. In the event I do not hear back from you within those 48 hours, if there\u2019s a wait-list, I will remove you from the RSVP list to have someone from the wait-list take your spot.<\/p>\n<p>So please be sure you have your meetup settings allowing me as organizer to send you messages through meetup directly. <\/p>\n<p><span>4) Removal: If you\u2019re been a member of the group for six months and haven\u2019t RSVP\u2019d or attended a single event, then I reserve the right to remove you from the group. I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you\u2019re genuinely interested in giving it a shot \u2013 stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and\/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group.

Make sure you are able to make it to an event to which you RSVP and if you anticipate a conflict or being late, give us a heads up. We understand that things come up and life interferes, but please do your best. ;)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*If you find that you can't make it to something you've signed up for -- CHANGE YOUR RSVP as soon as possible, or call\/text\/message an organizer\/event host if it is within 2 hours of the event. Events take time &amp; energy to plan. If you don't show up AND make no effort to let the Event Planner know what happened --- that's a \"NO SHOW\".<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*No Show\/Late Cancel policy: If you have a history of doing this (we keep track of attendance on your profile), we won't be able to count on you to show up when you say you are going to. Out of respect and courtesy to others that DO show up, we may bump you to the waiting list for meetups with limited space in favor of those with a positive attendance history.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple.

It will be fun, uplifting, powerful and supportive group which will meet bi-weekly. You can go to all the classes or pop in to any one, because they will each be complete in their own way and do not progress in a specific order or sequence. All the agreements are addressed over and over again from different aspects, and different exercises, tools etc are shared to help integrate each one into daily life.<\/p>","lon":-74.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/4\/9\/highres_435762825.jpeg","photo_id":435762825,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/4\/9\/600_435762825.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/7\/4\/9\/thumb_435762825.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":95863782,"name":"Christine Vida","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/b\/highres_242048795.jpeg","photo_id":242048795,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/b\/member_242048795.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/b\/thumb_242048795.jpeg"}},"members":299,"name":"Awaken Through Dreaming Meditation & Healing Exercises!","id":18314726,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Awaken-Your-Life-Workshops-NJ","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"NJ Awakening Dreamers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420765622000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"linguistic","name":"Linguistics","id":3552},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"linguists","name":"Linguists","id":70038}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Crazy-Language-Linguists\/","rating":0,"description":"Have you ever wondered what it's like to speak a language nobody else understands?

If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes. Our group meets to read and discuss the principles that make up the Daily Lessons, the Text, and the Manual for Teachers. For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way: Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0All are welcome to join us in this gentle and relaxed setting of learners.$5 donation for room.

I began marathon running in 2010 and consider running a bit of an obsession. After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs. The goal is to accommodate athletes who work abnormal hours and provide the valuable benefits of a running community for those with even the most demanding work schedule.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14630646,"name":"Steve N","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/highres_243261789.jpeg","photo_id":243261789,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/member_243261789.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/1\/d\/thumb_243261789.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"NY After-Hours Runner","id":18379811,"state":"NY","urlname":"After-Hours-Runner","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"After-hours Runners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422278895000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"knitting","name":"Knitting","id":212},{"urlkey":"community","name":"Community","id":15227},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"knitting-circle","name":"Knitting Circle","id":46642},{"urlkey":"charity-knitting","name":"Charity Knitting","id":99164},{"urlkey":"knitting-crocheting-for-charity","name":"Knitting  crocheting for charity","id":1110492}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/www-hugs-nyc-org\/","rating":0,"description":"\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffKnitting Hats Donating Umbrella's, knitting gloves, and scarves.

The constant headlines of change and disruption is enough to leave anyone with more questions than answers.<\/p>\n<p>While its natural to internalize and apply ones thinking to his\/her own interests, experts agree that it's also important to understand a view that is larger than that which transcends our own interests. The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics.

I'm Francesca - a 45 year old mom living in Maplewood. As a plus-sized woman, it's harder for me to find a network of like-minded women who come across the same challenges as I do in life... everything from shopping for clothes, to fitting in movie theater seats, to exercise. Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

I am starting this to see how it goes and hopefully we can kick it off to something big. :)<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>If you are on facebook please also consider joining our group there !<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/NYCMudRunners\/events\/<br><\/p>","lon":-73.8099975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":97938582,"name":"Jacqueline","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/5\/e\/highres_243445438.jpeg","photo_id":243445438,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/5\/e\/member_243445438.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/5\/e\/thumb_243445438.jpeg"}},"members":118,"name":"NYC Mud Runner's","id":18403570,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Mud-Runners","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Mud Runners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422825893000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"legal-professionals","name":"Legal Professionals","id":34082},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Legal-Tech-Startups\/","rating":0,"description":"Legal Tech Startups involved with law and technology to improve the legal industry.

Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace. The experience is often sublime, and always tailored to exactly what it is that you need next in your life.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/highres_243811229.jpeg","photo_id":243811229,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/member_243811229.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/thumb_243811229.jpeg"}},"members":168,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423514461000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"lunch","name":"Lunch","id":19892},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"meet-for-lunches","name":"Meet for Lunches","id":28189},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Focused-Networking-Happy-Hours-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi all!

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/highres_66728792.jpeg","photo_id":66728792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/member_66728792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/thumb_66728792.jpeg"}},"members":202,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp;

I like to call these events \"Girl's Night Out\" because I want you to feel like you are pampered!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy teaching new techniques, stamping with my friends, and making various home decor items using rubber stamps, die cuts, and beautiful papers.  Join my monthly classes for inspiration, socialization, or to learn something new!  \n\nI have several ideas for upcoming meetups -- some will be classes where we will make several cards or a home decor item, and others will be an open house style where you can each bring your own paper crafting projects, and you can use all of my non-consumables such as punches, the Big Shot die cutting machine (and all the many dies I have), stamps, and ink.  I will provide great snacks (usually involves CHOCOLATE in one form or another) and drinks, and assist you with your creative projects.  Each class will be priced according to materials involved.\nI hope you will join me and I look forward to meeting some new friends who share this hobby!\n\nStampingly,\n\nSelene Ferguson","lon":-73.5899963379,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184446280,"name":"Selene Ferguson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/highres_244070559.jpeg","photo_id":244070559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/member_244070559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/5\/7\/f\/thumb_244070559.jpeg"}},"members":44,"name":"South Shore Stampin Haven","id":18435309,"state":"NY","urlname":"South-Shore-Stampin-Haven","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Stampers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424008402000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"italiancar","name":"Italian Cars","id":4595},{"urlkey":"britishcars","name":"British Cars","id":10826},{"urlkey":"sports-cars","name":"Sports Cars","id":15179},{"urlkey":"car-enthusiasts","name":"Car Enthusiasts","id":16333},{"urlkey":"cars","name":"Cars","id":20578},{"urlkey":"custom-cars","name":"Custom Cars","id":20579},{"urlkey":"exotic-cars","name":"Exotic Cars","id":27721},{"urlkey":"european-cars","name":"European Cars","id":28352}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCExotics\/","rating":0,"description":"Where exotics ignite passion; passion to drive, passion for the streets; exhaust notes like a grand symphony in the busy streets of NYC!

All our members know that our club is the best place you can learn communication and leadership skills in both English and Japanese. We have accomplished the \"Distinguished Toastmasters Club Award\" 5 years in a row. This award is given by Toastmasters International to the clubs that accomplished at least 5 of its specified goals. Not only is our club effective, but it is so much fun that it\u2019s addictive! Our membership is open to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills in a culturally diverse environment. We meet in mid-town Manhattan twice a month, and in each meeting, we run two sessions; first in English and then in Japanese. However, you do not need to speak Japanese and you are very welcome to participate in the English session only. Our club provides a friendly and supportive environment where you can build up confidence with each speaking assignment. By regularly presenting a speech in front of like-minded professionals, you will soon find yourself speaking in a more relaxed and confident manner to the board of directors, to your customers or even in job interviews! Feel free to join us as a guest and see for yourself how it works.

Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other.

Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.
