When 80-year-old police detective Arthur Bryant gets blown up in an explosion at the North London Peculiar Crimes Unit headquarters, his longtime partner, John May, investigates his death. After some long, lecturing dialogue and an early chapter told from the viewpoint of a character who turns out to be of no consequence, the author reaches the core of his story\u2014a flashback to the duo's first case during the London Blitz. In late 1940, the Palace Theatre is staging a production of Orpheus in the Underworld when the body of a dancer is found, sans feet. From this point forward, the intrigues of the theater murders, which decimate the cast, create considerable drama. The potency of Greek myth, conjured up by the opera being staged, is skillfully played out in the detectives' theories about the killer. The dynamic between May and Bryant makes for compelling reading, while the hubris of a police underling, Sidney Biddle, provides additional tension. Both past and present plots reach satisfying resolutions. Now that Fowler has set the stage, no doubt his second Bryant and May mystery will get off to a better start.<\/p> <p>Agent, Howard Morhaim.

Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, \u2018\u2018inappropriate\u2019\u2019 rapidly transitions to\u2018\u2018nightmarish\u2019\u2019, especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The FreeBSD \u2018\u2018Jail\u2019\u2019 facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX\u2018\u2018root\u2019\u2019 model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments.<\/p> <p><br\/>Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads<\/p> <p><br\/>===========================================<\/p> <p>Server consolidation, which allows multiple workloads to run on the same system, has become increasingly important as a way to improve the utilization of computing resources and reduce costs. Consolidation is common in mainframe environments, where technology to support running multiple workloads and even multiple operating systems on the same hardware has been evolving since the late 1960\u2019s. This technology is now becoming an important differentiator in the UNIX and Linux server market as well, both at the low end (virtual web hosting) and high end(traditional data center server consolidation).This paper introduces Solaris Zones (zones), a fully realized solution for server consolidation projects in a commercial UNIX operating system. By creating virtualized application execution environments within a single instance of the operating system, the facility strikes a unique balance between competing requirements. On the one hand, a system with multiple workloads needs to run those workloads in isolation, to ensure that applications can neither observe data from other applications nor affect their operation. It must also prevent applications from over-consuming system resources. On the other hand, the system as a whole has to be flexible, manageable, and observable, in order to reduce administrative costs and increase efficiency. By focusing on the support of multiple application environments rather than multiple operating system instances, zones meets isolation requirements without sacrificing manageability.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/michaelrbernste.in\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/tomasp.net\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide development of the <a href=\"http:\/\/smartos.org\/\">SmartOS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.joyent.com\/private-cloud\">SmartDataCenter<\/a> platforms, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/\">Node.js<\/a> platform.

Anything goes except a solid cube. How much detail will you add? Will you have any moving parts? When we arrive, we\u2019ll slice our models, and use the 3D printers at Fat Cat to print them out.

Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing....

My training has been in what is called core shamanism, practices and healing methods distilled from different shamanic traditions around the world. These methods are used for healing, guidance, and gaining insight, inspiration and creativity for oneself and others in the community.<\/p> <p>My offering to our BSFW community is this workshop, in which we will be utilizing shamanic practices to facilitate creativity and to add a new dimension to your writing process.<\/p> <p>In this Shamanic Writing Room meeting, we will do exercises and writing prompts based on the practices of guided journeying (guided meditations) to open up access to deeper creativity. To enter a meditative state, I will lead you by my oral instructions and\/or a drumbeat.<\/p> <p>On your guided journeys, you can meet beings and creatures, both human and non-human, who will inspire you, lead you into other worlds, give you new storylines and ideas, and offer helpful advice. You may see a story unfold or you may personally be involved in the story.<\/p> <p>The schedule for the afternoon will be as follows:<\/p> <p>7:00pm-7:30pm<\/p> <p>To begin our evening, we will introduce ourselves and you will set your own personal goal for the meeting. This could be, for example: <i>I want to write more during the week, I want to break through a block I am experiencing in this story\/novel\/project<\/i>. We will set up a special collective place with all of our inspiration objects (see below in list of things to bring with you).<\/p> <p>We will enter into a meditative place with some stretching and deep breathing.<\/p> <p>7:30pm-8:30pm:<\/p> <p>I will lead you through two guided meditations. You will write down your experiences and then will be able to share, if you\u2019d like (you don\u2019t have to).<\/p> <p>The 2 guided meditations (journeys) will be:<\/p> <p>1 - meeting with the source of your creativity<\/p> <p><br\/>2 - merging with an element (fire, water, earth, or air)<\/p> <p><br\/>The meditations (journeys) will be done with my guidance and instruction in a safe and supportive environment. There will be absolutely no drugs (except coffee!).<\/p> <p>From 8:30pm-9:30pm, we will all write together, just as in the traditional Writing Room.<\/p> <p>Please note: This meeting is limited to seven people.<\/p> <p>Please bring, if you have these:<\/p> <p>eye covering (a scarf works well)<\/p> <p>blanket<\/p> <p>notebook &amp; pens<\/p> <p>coloring materials<\/p> <p>an object, poem, quote, excerpt that inspires you (inspiration objects)<\/p> <p>Following is some background and information about shamanism:<\/p> <p>Shamanism is an ancient spiritual path and practice that has existed for 100,000 years all over the world. What I have studied and what I practice is core shamanism, which distills the integral practices and methods from all traditions.<\/p> <p>It is helpful to remember that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you believe in other worlds or use shamanic language in your own belief system. What is conducive to inspiration is your openness and willingness to try something new. Inspiration occurs in different ways and there is usually a mysterious and unknown aspect to it. If you get a great idea, feel expansions and shifts in perspective, are able to write in a way you never have before, that is what is important. You have your own unique faith and define it for yourself. It is important to honor that in yourself and trust yourself as to what you need, even if you may not know or understand all of the details involved.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers\/events\/227318165\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":9000000,"name":"Shamanic Writing Room","id":"227318165","time":1455235200000,"updated":1455245491000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1278875895000,"name":"Brooklyn Speculative Fiction Writers","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1673851,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"writers of speculative fiction"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","phone":"212-966-6514","address_1":"23 Greene Street, Soho","name":"TARA Offices","lon":-74.002846,"id":17988732,"state":"NY","lat":40.721256,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.10116314888,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432580678000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Living-with-BPD-Support-Education-TARA-Meetup\/events\/228182165\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"New York City: Get The Facts About BPD: Support & Psychoeducation Workshop","id":"mkzghlyvcblc","time":1455235200000,"updated":1455246954000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1390350742000,"name":"NYC Get the Facts about BPD: Support & Education TARA Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":12349422,"urlname":"NYC-Living-with-BPD-Support-Education-TARA-Meetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"254 3rd Ave","lon":-73.985725,"phone":"(347) 457-5760","name":"718 Cyclery","id":24280062,"state":"NY","lat":40.678226,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.97435855865,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454614787000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Learn how to bleed and maintain both Shimano and Avid type hydrodynamic brake systems<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Adventure-Cycling-Club\/events\/228615797\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Class 06: Hydraulic Brakes","id":"228615797","time":1455235200000,"updated":1455247029000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451834583000,"name":"NYC Adventure Cycling Club","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19269145,"urlname":"NYC-Adventure-Cycling-Club","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07645","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Montvale","address_1":"4 Woodland Road","name":"St Paul's Episcopal Church","lon":-74.037679,"id":3527972,"state":"NJ","lat":41.044178,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.5193805695,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450034089000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>What is Centering Prayer?<br\/>According to Wikepedia...<br\/>\"\"Centering Prayer is a method of silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of contemplative prayer, prayer in which we experience God's presence within us, closer than breathing, closer than thinking, closer than consciousness itself.

For the last 3 years, I have been learning a whole new approach to relationships. It\u2019s changed everything for me. I\u2019m doing work I\u2019m passionate about, I have an amazing partner, and my sex life has done a complete 180.<\/p> <p>So what\u2019s at the core of this new approach? In one word: Orgasm.<\/p> <p>Are you still with me?<\/p> <p>Good, because it's not what you\u2019re probably thinking! I\u2019m not simply talking about a climax in the bedroom (although that can be part of it). It\u2019s more about approaching life with the same sense of desire, sensitivity, and surrender that we often keep locked away for all but the most intimate of situations out of fear that it is inappropriate.<\/p> <p>Well, guess what? I\u2019m here to tell you that it is not! In fact, in this new way of relating, it is the MOST appropriate thing you could possibly do.<\/p> <p>You see, as human beings, we are wired for connection. It\u2019s a natural part of our DNA. And while in some ways we live in a very connected world (Facebook, smartphones, etc.), it can feel so hard these days to get the deep intimate connection with another human being that we really desire.<\/p> <p>What would your life and relationships look like if you lived this fully out? Come find out as I tell you my story of the transformations I have undergone since deciding it was time for an upgrade, and how I\u2019ve tapped into this Orgasmic approach to life through the practice of Orgasmic Meditation (OM). It\u2019s sure to be a night of sensational discussion!<\/p> <p>Event is free to attend.

We will be playing one of our favorite games, Hot Seats!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hot Seats is a fun communication game where one person at a time can volunteer to have the attention the rest of the group placed on them for 1-2 minutes while they can be asked any question on any topic. You can chose to lie, tell the truth, or pass, but it's always encouraged to let your true self come out in a safe a fun environment.<\/p> <p>Whether you are someone who already OMs, you are curious and want to meet some of the OM community, or you just want to enjoy a warm and electric evening of connection, come join us!!<\/p> <p>Bring an item of food if you desire, and we will provide some extra food too! If you can't or don't have time, just bring $10 to drop in the jar.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It's a casual atmosphere and one of our favorite ways to introduce friends to the concept of OM and the community itself since there will be lots of people there with years of experience in the practice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The event is free! The door will open at\u00a07:45 and lock at 8:10 sharp, so please be on time!<\/p> <p><i>For questions contact [masked] |[masked]\u00a0<\/i>\u00a0<br\/>Can't make this one? \u00a0visit us at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.turnonny.us\/\">www.turnonny.us<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OneTasteNewYork\/events\/228289651\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":7200000,"name":"Open House!

The views from the ridgeline in the crisp winter air are unrivaled (and seemingly endless). However, as difficult as the traverse can be in the summer, winter takes every aspect of the traverse and cranks it to 11. The terrain is more treacherous, the temperatures plummet quickly, the winds hit triple digits on most days, snowfall is measured in feet instead of inches, avalanches are common on the large snowfields and in the ravines, and visibility can disappear in minutes ...<\/p> <p>... persons wishing to complete a Presi Traverse in winter must be physically strong, familiar with winter mountaineering and compass orientation techniques, very familiar with the terrain, and have high quality winter gear. A winter traverse can go from beautiful to deadly very quickly.<\/p> <p><b>FULL winter gear needed. \u00a0Research your gear needs before you go.<\/b><\/p> <p>Success on this hike is up to you!

Being both at the intersection of several storm tracks and the center of multiple converging valleys funneling wind from the west, southwest, and south make its weather unpredictable and at times violent. The summit of Mount Washington has been known to see snow and ice in all seasons and is subject to a combination of hurricane force winds and blanketing clouds an average of 110 days a year. The mountain long held the record for the highest wind speed ever recorded at the Earth's surface, clocking 231 miles per hour (372\u00a0km\/h), forcing summit buildings to be chained down so they won't blow away.<\/p> <p><b>THE FINE PRINT ...

As a loose (VERY loose) selection principle (i.e. for selecting the books we read), we look to Marcel Proust - NOT for reading his masterwork \u201cIn Search of Lost time,\u201d but for inspiration from the rich \u201cintertext\u201d within (intertext= other texts alluded to or influencing the top one.) You don't have to be a Proustian to partake of our potpourri - only an appetite for reading with us and for talking about what we read.

Skiing &amp;\/or brunch in Tannersville Accommodations<\/i><\/b><i> <b>\/ Cost: $104.25<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>We'll rent one or two cabin units within 5-10 miles of the trailhead in Hunter; This includes a spot in two queen, full or single beds or space to unroll a sleeping bag in the living room. The sub total so far is $104.25 for the long weekend. I'll confirm the price per person closer to the date. A $45 deposit is required to reserve a spot in the lodge with us!<\/p> <p><br\/>To reserve your spot, please remit payment for the deposit to Mike via <b>Venmo<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.venmo.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.venmo.com<\/a>) or <b>Paypal <\/b>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/<\/a><\/a>). Send $45 deposit to me ([masked]), being sure to check \"I'm sending money to family or friends\" if using Paypal.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>**Please Note <\/b>that by RSVP-ing to attend this Meetup, you are agreeing to pay the organizer(s) for the cabin reservation within a reasonable time frame prior to the long weekend -- Receipt of the deposit reserves your spot for the weekend accommodations. Your attendance will be revoked and offered to someone else if the deposit is not received by Jan. 10 to be courteous to others who may like to attend.Everyone's work schedule differs. By making the deposit, you signify you will make it to the agreed upon departure spot in Manhattan by 7 p.m., with a ~20 minute window for stragglers who text that they're on the way.<\/p> <p><b>Weather<\/b>: This is an all weather event. We will monitor the forecast for severe weather and may cancel depending on the severity of the predicted weather.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Gear:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>1) Hiking boots &amp; poles (optional), gloves &amp; hat - winter hikes and at times descents of 1,000 ~ 1,500 feet of elevation are not something you want to mess with - it's better to have ankle support than to try to descend a 35-er in trail shoes or sneakers or mid-cut shoes designed for Harriman.<\/p> <p><br\/>2) Since these are winter ascents, micro-spikes or crampons are required. Ice, rain or snow (or no icea) at 2,000+ feet of elevation it's always best to carry spikes than to not carry them and have to descend 1,000 feet of elevation without them. Catskills ascents are not really geared towards snow-shoeing, plus with the mild past two winters, I'd advise against bringing in the first place.<\/p> <p><br\/>3) Moisture-wicking layered clothing fit for winter dayhikes, such as fleece, thermal base layer or synthetic wool shirt and outer rainshell or puffy jacket; Obviously you know your body the best, so when you break into a sweat on the 2.5 miles up, it's best to dry off during that short break at the peak and avoid those parts of the day when there could be shadows b\/w mountain valleys or cool breezes in general, so layering is key and not staying damp!<\/p> <p>4) Hydration: no matter of Camelback or Nalgene bottles or the latest brand on the market at REI, I always say bring up to 2 liters of water for a 6 to 8 mile hike.<\/p> <p><br\/>**If you're new to hiking, check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Backwoods-Adventurers\/pages\/Proper_Gear%3A_Day_Hikes\">day hiking gear recommendation page<\/a>.<\/p> <p><br\/>5) Food \/ Snacks: We'll have the ability to have coffee &amp; light breakfast at the cabin before we drive to the trailhead; after that I'd recommend bringing trail mix snacks or Cliff bars in general plus fruit or greens \/ sandwich or whatever you like for a peak lunch! We'll be having dinner out on Saturday \/ Sunday nights in Phoenicia or Tannersville, depending on a group vote.<\/p> <p><br\/>6) Camera phone \/ camera - we prefer not to stop every 15 minutes for photo takers, Instagram or tweeters, but encourage you to bring yr phone \/ camera for group shots here and there! Cell phone service is poor pretty much everywhere in the Catskills so don't expect to communicate with the outside world much unless there's Wifi at the lodge!!<\/p> <p>7) NYNJTC trail maps (Trail Map #143 - Southern Catskills) - optional, but doesn't hurt to buy these maps at REI, EMS, Campmoor, NYNJTC website or elsewhere - Depending on how serious of a 3500 hiker you are! Or download to your smartphone! (last I checked, $7 per segment in So. Catskills vs. No. Catskills thru PDF Maps &amp; NYNJTC download)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Transportation:<\/b> We will carpool and passengers pick up the tab on gas\/tolls. If we do not have enough drivers we will rent a car or van and split the cost. Please post if you need a ride or can give a ride.

Rubin Pavilion, 1st Floor (to the right of the entrance) at 11 a.m. and stay until 5:30 p.m. This is a free event on our end, though The Brooklyn Museum is a suggested donation museum. Only pay what you are able to afford.<\/p> <p>*The BK Museum does not allow backpacks within the museum and will insist they be checked. Messenger or tote bags are your best bet for hauling your supplies.<\/p> <p>*The museum cafes are a bit expensive. Consider brown bagging lunch or going out to one of the local shops on Washington Ave, just a 2 minute walk from the museum.<\/p> <p>*There will be a mid-day work share at 2:00 p.m. at the Beaux-Art Court on the 3rd floor. The location of the mid-day meetup may be changed based on crowds and access. Any location changes will be announced on the fbook group page the day of the event.<\/p> <p>*Final crit will begin at around 5:30 p.m. that evening in the Great Hall on the 1st floor by the KAWS sculpture. Again, any changes will be announced throughout the day.<\/p> <p><br\/>**For those of you coming from within the city, or for those from LI who prefer to take the LIRR to Atlantic Terminal: the 2\/3 is the closest subway to The BK Museum. Take either to the 'Eastern Pkwy\/Brooklyn Museum' stop, and the museum entrance is upstair.<\/p> <p>***For those who prefer drive, see the museum website for directions. There is usually street parking that time of day in front of the park on Eastern Pkwy, as alternate side ends at 10:30a.m.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brooklynmuseum.org\/visit\/directions\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brooklynmuseum.org\/visit\/directions\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.brooklynmuseum.org\/visit\/directions\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>We had a great time last month at the The Met and some super cool pieces were created that day, so we are looking forward to another day of creative fun!

This week we will continue our discussions on the Foundations of Mindfulness\u00a0and explore how and why the Breath is used as a primary meditation object.\u00a0Thich Nhat Hahn explains that the \"breath is the bridge\u00a0which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts.\"<\/p> <p>In meditation practice we learn that being with the breath is an experience we feel directly in the body; we are not just thinking about what breath is like. When we are \"in\" the experience of breathing we also see it is not stable, but is always changing and flowing. As we see the changeability or impermanence of the breath, we also begin to see the changeability or impermanence of all things. Right there In this midst of constant change is where the breath becomes our\u00a0home base and resting place.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p><b>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

You will find none of those products at our bar.\"<\/p> <p>\"In addition to company provided items, Pine Box Rock Shop also provides in-house alternatives to traditionally non-vegan bar favorites such as Bloody Mary\u2019s (some of the best in the city, vegan or not, so we\u2019ve been told!) and our own homemade Irish Creme.

Malevich\u2019s late work is examined as an intricate set of reflections on some of the problems raised by the systems that he set in the 1910s. Additionally, Fer argues that the Brazilian avant- garde of the late 1950s offers a radically reconfigured and innovative view of the significance of Malevich\u2019s work and its historical repercussions, which repays close attention today.

At the suggestion of Jann, and with Bernie Saunders' campaign having gained momentum this week, I've chosen inequality, one of his signature issues, as our first topic. Please note, the focus of our discussion will primarily (though not exclusively) concern the philosophic, as opposed to economic, aspects of the topic. We will first differentiate the traditional concept of equality of rights from the contemporary concept of equality of condition. With this as context, we will then ask: when is equality a value? When is inequality a disvalue?<\/p> <p>As recommended reading regarding the traditional concept of equality of rights, I'm going to do something a bit immodest and suggest that everyone take the time to read my brief essay on the political philosophy of John Locke:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/V6NJ3G\u00a0(Over\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/V6NJ3G\u00a0(Over<\/a> the\u00a0last several years, this essay has been surprisingly popular on Google, with over 55,000 visits averaging over five minutes each.)

In this dynamic, interactive evening combining individual work with group process, you will learn techniques to liberate this energy and access more pleasure in your life. These techniques will be demonstrated through individual body readings with select participants who choose to take the risk of revealing a sexual issue and are willing to work through it in a supportive environment with expert guidance.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dr. Kincaid uses the teachings of Integral Evolutionary Tantra and the principles of Core Energetics to open up physical blocks and places where life energy doesn\u2019t move. In Integral Evolutionary Tantric teachings and in Core Energetics -- a powerful body-based process -- sexual energy and life force energy are one and the same. Join us with body readings, deep truth, wild goodness, radical personal transformation and, if you dare, the evolution of your own personal enlightenment.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<i><b>Note:<\/b>\u00a0This workshop is for both couples and singles.

Showcasing works by Norwegian contemporary artists Per Christian Brown, Benedicte Clementsen, Elin Melberg, Margrethe Aanestad, and Kristin Velle-George, <i>Transcendental Tactility<\/i> will utilize a variety of media, such as film, painting, textile, sculpture, and drawing. Working with a shared interest in materiality and techniques, artists included in this exhibit will explore personal and universal experience through abstraction. Underlining sensibilities, tactility, and fragility inherent in materials, work included in this exhibit excavates timeless and subjective forms. <i>Transcendental Tactility<\/i> invites the audience to explore the subjective history within objects, their own subjective perceptions, and larger themes of time and presence.<\/p> <p>Recognizing the contradictions within the artists\u2019 work, <i>Transcendental Tactility<\/i> will serve to highlight the overlapping themes within their practices. Aanestads\u00b4 minimalist work revolves around form, spatiality and materiality, which she explores in a contemplative and abstract language. Melberg examines points of intersection\u2013where is the line between being in control and losing control? How much can the materials take before they burst or fray? Placing greater focus on the psychology of color and material, Brown dwells on that which is hidden and exploring micro- and macro-cosms. Clementsen is interested in the man-made, exploring survival strategies and transition rituals that address existential questions, while Velle-George is occupied by the space between human knowledge and imagination, focusing on the physical and metaphysical concepts. An overarching theme of materiality pervades the show, but ultimately the collective narrative created by the artists is ambiguous and the viewer\u2019s perspective and subjectivity becomes key in extracting meaning.<\/p> <p>Open Source collaborated with Prosjektrom Normanns and the individual artists over several years, through various exhibitions and projects. Established in 2011, Prosjektrom Normanns is a non-profit exhibition space located in Stavanger, Norway. The project space is run by its members, artists Margrethe Aanestad, Kristin Velle-George, Elin Melberg. Prosjektrom Normanns exhibits both national and international artists, primarily focusing on site-specific exhibitions and exchange with spaces and initiatives across the globe. The group is active in collaborations with art institutions such as Kunsthall Stavanger, Rogaland Kunstsenter and Rogaland Art College. The Prosjektrom Normanns exhibition program is supported by the City of Stavanger, Rogaland County and the Norwegian Arts Council.<\/p> <p>This exhibit is supported by the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/American-Scandinavian-Foundation\/147492291952006\">American Scandinavian Foundation<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceGallery\/events\/228457744\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"PROSJEKTROM NORMANNS: Transcendental Tactility","id":"228457744","time":1455408000000,"updated":1455416121000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442518768000,"name":"Open Source Gallery","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18941888,"urlname":"OpenSourceGallery","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"106 E. 19th St. ","name":"The Watering Hole","lon":-73.987457,"id":17737872,"state":"NY","lat":40.737198,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.896383523941,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454079593000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/9\/600_446242585.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>They say love is a numbers game.

Company commander Claus M. Pedersen (Pilou Asb\u00e6k,\u00a0Lucy, A Hijacking, R) and his men are stationed in an Afghan province. Meanwhile, back in Denmark, Claus\u2019 wife Maria (Tuva Novotny) is trying to hold everyday life together with a husband at war and three children who are missing their father. During a routine mission, the soldiers are caught in heavy crossfire and in order to save his men, Claus makes a decision that ultimately sees him return to Denmark accused of a war crime. The film strives towards realism by employing those who have been closest to the conflict, using Danish soldiers and Taliban warriors, relatives and refugees.

Meanwhile, back in Denmark, Claus\u2019 wife Maria (Tuva Novotny) is trying to hold everyday life together with a husband at war and three children who are missing their father. During a routine mission, the soldiers are caught in heavy crossfire and in order to save his men, Claus makes a decision that ultimately sees him return to Denmark accused of a war crime. The film strives towards realism by employing those who have been closest to the conflict, using Danish soldiers and Taliban warriors, relatives and refugees.
