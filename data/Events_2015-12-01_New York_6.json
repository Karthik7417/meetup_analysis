They see it through.<\/p> <p><br\/>Producers are usually business minded, like money but also like art, like organizing, are natural leaders, are the hardest workers, the first to set, the last to leave, the ones up earliest, with the most bruises, have made the most mistakes (because they shoulder the most responsibility) and plainly have taken an oath to see it through to the best of their and the project's ability.<\/p> <p><br\/>It's a tough job.

The subsequent response scoring process gives us the raw data for input into statistical models for adaptive learning. As we move towards three dimensional science assessment as defined by the Next Generation Science Standards we need new automated methods for translating digital work products to scored observable variables.<\/p> <p>I will present aspects of the response scoring process we are building at Amplify Science\u2014a brand new, digitally-enhanced core curriculum for K-8 science. Students use web-based scientific simulations to explore, experiment with, and model complex scientific phenomena. Automated scoring of responses to these complex performance tasks is non-trivial because there are many potential features to score for any one response or process. I will show how we use messy user-interaction (log file or clickstream) data from a Natural Selection app to auto-score specific responses using a rules-based scorer and a machine learning classifier. I estimate task validity using a comparative analysis of content-expert ratings, evidence rule scoring, and machine learning approaches. The machine learning approaches are shown to agree with expert human scoring as well or better than human-written scoring rules. We are continuing to develop our approach to automated scoring using additional validation and scoring methods.<\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b>Samuel Crane is the analytics lead and a Project Principal on the K-8 Science curriculum product at Amplify.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition.

The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen. He began his training with Horace Daukei, the last surviving traditional doctor (medicine man) among the Kiowa Tribe. Ben went on to study with Chinese Master Li Tai Liang. He continues to train intensively in the Chinese systems of xin yi, bagua, tai chi and chi gong.<\/p> <p>Please go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doiohm.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.doiohm.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.doiohm.com<\/a>...<\/a> or call (913)[masked] for more information<\/p> <p>I'm working out in the field much of the time and I have very limited access to the internet.

Remarkably, minimalism, started around the 1960s, is not all about white walls, gray furniture, and vacant surfaces. The \"less is more\" movement began in the post-World-War-II-era and made its way via the arts, architecture, design, literature, and even music. There is value to understanding minimalism in the context of Getting Things Done (GTD). Additionally, though, designing a simple life has strong elements for reducing stresses and increasing productivity, the primary aims of GTD. The Simple Living culminating principle is efficiency of possessions, consumption, and effort (time and energy). In our modern era, Gandhi lived as an archetype of living simply. In this discussion, let's discuss how minimalism\u00a0and\u00a0simple living both work together to help GTDers be more productive.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to bring your copy of GTD, your questions and thoughts on minimalism and simple living as well!

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein. \u00a0A monster assembled by a scientist from parts of dead bodies develops a mind of his own as he learns to loathe himself and hate his creator<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-fiction-society-northern-nj\/events\/219106291\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Suspense Central:  Frankenstein by Mary Shelley - PLEASE NOTE DATE CHANGE","id":"zfhbqytpbmb","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/5\/5\/global_8705717.jpeg","time":1447722000000,"updated":1447824392000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1233007408000,"name":"The Science Fiction Society of Northern New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1367789,"urlname":"science-fiction-society-northern-nj","group_lat":41.0699996948,"who":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1429560201000,"fee":{"amount":4,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0<b>ABSOLUTELY NO CLEATS ALLOWED!

PLEASE RSVP using the link above since this event is not affiliated with meetup.com or our group in any way. \u00a0The event is at\u00a029 Little West 12th Street\u00a0New York, NY 10014 so if anyone knows a chill, quiet, not too crowded bar nearby for us to meet up beforehand, please let me know, otherwise I\u2019ll have to just rely on yelp for suggestions and update the location accordingly. \u00a0The Ableton event is at 7:00 so we should try to meet at a bar around 5:30 - 6:00 and then head over there around 6:45. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>P.S., if anyone is looking for private lessons in Ableton Live or FL Studio for production or playing live, I provide these services and you can contact me directly on Meetup.com, thanks. \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Electronic-Music-Producers\/events\/226730055\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Ableton Meetup \/ PSA For Members","id":"226730055","time":1447800300000,"updated":1447813007000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377054503000,"name":"The Electronic Music Producers","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":9902072,"urlname":"NYC-Electronic-Music-Producers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Producers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Rahway","address_1":"TBD","name":"Bill's Place","lon":-74.274361,"id":24016698,"state":"NJ","lat":40.60434,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.0175857544,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446678193000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i><b>From perhaps the most humble of beginnings, a desperate band must survive a supernatural storm and escape from a joined force of goblin and orc slavers.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Having found another dragonborn prisoner, the survivors of the wreck encountered an ancient priest of the goddess of the abandoned temple. He told them some of the background of the island and the former king, one Viledel. While he seemed cooperative enough, his skittishness and realization that his personal items had been taken and were being worn by the survivors put him off. Storming off into the darkened temple, he left them to their own wits.<\/p> <p>They developed a plan to lure more goblins into the abandoned temple to kill them and take their weapons. The plan worked well, though not as well as had been hoped. There were many injuries and even a death, which even Dr. Tsou's miraculous healing talent could not undo.<\/p> <p><br\/>As they rested and thought about what to do next, a divine apparition appeared and warned them of her plans to destroy the foul creatures that had defiled her temple several days beforehand. Knowing their innocence in this, she granted her blessing to them, including restoring breath and life to their fallen friend.<\/p> <p>With new-found purpose a plan was devised to break back into the manor house. Unfortunately, the entrance that had been used previously was now guarded by a band of orcs, which the group decided could be taken out with the bows they had just acquired from the goblins they'd slain at the temple.<\/p> <p>The orcs moved faster than they expected and managed to close into melee, and the leader of the orcs was noted to himself be a priest of one of the ocean gods. Through skill and luck the orcs were defeated just as the final blessing of the goddess washed over them:\u00a0Everyone is now 1st level.<\/p> <p><b><i>At this time, this meetup event is closed to new members.

However, the dirty secret whispered in the back rooms of most nonprofits is that most employee engagement programs require more effort than they are worth to the nonprofit beneficiary.<\/p> <p>In this shoot-out-style event, hear representatives of the corporate\/HR and nonprofit sectors debate the often-competing interests at play in employee engagement and philanthropy. And learn from some of the managers of the best employee engagement programs in the country, who will speak about how to model partnerships to provide maximum value to both stakeholders: the company (and its employees) and the nonprofit beneficiary (and its constituents).<\/p> <p>\n\n\nModerator<\/p> <p><b>Jorge Fontanez, Founder\/CEO, Marca Studio<\/b><\/p> <p>Between 2011 and 2014, Jorge developed and oversaw Chase Community Giving, a J.P.

While many academic moves have negligible effect on the research program of faculty members, our move has had a profound effect in the research topics being pursued,<br\/>and also in how our research is being translated into practice. The collaboration with NYC agencies and companies (including AT&amp;T, KPF, and MLB.com) have fundamentally impacted our projects by providing a<br\/>strong foundation of real problems to be solved.<\/p> <p>\n\nIn this talk, we will describe some projects in urban data<br\/>visualization and sports analytics. In particular, we will describe Urbane, a 3D framework to support data driven decision making in urban development, developed in collaboration with Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF), and the Baseball Metrics Engine, which is part of<br\/>MLB.com's Statcast (developed in collaboration with Dr. Carlos Dietrich).<\/p> <p>This work has a large number of collaborators, including Juliana Freire, Huy Vo, Harish Doraiswamy, Theo Damoulas, Nivan Ferreira, Marcos Lage, Luc Wilson, Heidi Werner, and Muchan Park.

In 2013, he was elected an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow and in 2014 he won the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award. He helped develop MLB.com's Statcast player tracking system, which won the Alpha Award for Best Analytics Innovation\/Technology at the 2015 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.

We will have a brief introduction to these changes at the meeting.\u00a0<\/p> <p>October 2015 has had many similarities to October 2014. One year ago, stock markets throughout the world were plunging. The drop was stopped when the European central bank (ECB) announced it would be doing QE -- quantitative easing (a form of money printing, which central banks have doing since 2008). This year, stock markets began falling apart in August starting in China. To stop the drop, the ECB said it would do even more QE than it was already doing. China announced its own stimulus measures as did Japan. The FED held off on raising interest rates from ZERO to 0.25% (at least two European central banks have NEGATIVE rates). Existing stimulus wasn't enough to keep stock prices up, more and more has been necessary -- as is the case with heroin addiction, an apt model to describe how the markets are currently working (<b>UPDATE<\/b>: <i><b>The financial heroin no longer seems to be working<\/b><\/i>).<\/p> <p><br\/>We pointed out in the September and October meetings that one important piece of confirmation was missing to say there was a downtrend in place in the US.

Your objective throughout the night will be to get out of the rat race and into the fast track! In other words you have to find a way to get out of that 9-5 that we all dislike and step into the life you always wanted to live.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHow do you get out of the race race you ask?<\/p> <p>Your total monthly passive income has to be higher than your total monthly expenses.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nCashflow 101 is an educational tool in board game format which aims to teach the players concepts of investing by having their money work for them in a risk free setting (play money) while simultaneously increasing financial\u00a0literacy and stressing the imperative nature of accountability.<\/p> <p><br\/>There are two stages to the game. In the first, \"the rat race\", the player aims to raise his or her character's passive income level to where it exceeds the character's expenses. The winner is determined in the second stage, \"the fast track\". To win, a player must get his or her character to buy their \"dream\" or accumulate an additional $50,000 in monthly cash flow.<\/p> <p>In place of \u201cscore cards\u201d, there are financial statements. The game requires the players to fill out their own financial statements so that they can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate income and demonstrates that liabilities and 'doodads' are expenses.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJR-Investment-Group\/events\/226701197\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Cashflow 101- learn how to get out of the rat race in real life!","id":"226701197","time":1447803000000,"updated":1447814593000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1350833487000,"name":"NJ\/NY Real Estate Investors & Entrepreneurs","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":5489542,"urlname":"NJR-Investment-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Real Estate Investors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","city":"NY","address_1":"9 St. Marks Place","address_2":"(between 2nd Ave & 3rd Ave) ","lon":-73.989086,"phone":"(212) 228-2887 ","name":"Boka","id":1230836,"state":"NY","lat":40.729464,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":1.4227707386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445925076000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/23BFl59VOTP0PD5c_S3UuA\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>EVENT TYPE:<\/b> Dining<\/p> <p><b>DESCRIPTION:<\/b><br\/>KFC takes on a new meaning, Korean Fried Chicken, and it's delicious.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

When the group was in Boston, the members all pledged to write something ambitious and potentially life changing, and that was such a rewarding experience. We even wrote and published a book called \"Seven At The Sevens,\" which is for sale on WritersAnonymous.org and Amazon. Also, if you do a Google search for \"Seven At The Sevens,\" it's the first item that pops up! While there, you can also find our NPR interview about the book. Although we ended up publishing a book, the group\u2019s main mission was about keeping each other\u2019s writing going and on track, and holding each writer accountable to his\/her own self-imposed but ambitious goals. The main purpose of WritersAnonymous.org was\u00a0<i>not<\/i>\u00a0about publishing a book or to have each other\u2019s writings critiqued, although that can and did happen.<\/p> <p>Further, WritersAnonymous is about being inspired by your peers and inspiring others to find their own voices. It is about connecting with people who have a similar passion in life and who may understand you a little better because they have the same burning desire to tell a story in whatever written form it may emerge. It is also about forging new and lasting friendships in a supportive and encouraging environment during the often lonely and difficult creative writing process.<\/p> <p>So, want to write and create something worthwhile, and also equally help others in their literary journeys?

If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book.\u00a0 If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group.\u00a0 Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

Those will be different events you'll need to register for which are separate from the daily co-working space.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/226810505\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":28800000,"name":"Indie Coworking Space","id":"htvgmlytpbxb","time":1447858800000,"updated":1447888180000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"17th Street and 2nd Ave, New York, NY","name":"Stuyvesant Square Park","lon":-73.983551,"id":24184806,"state":"NY","lat":40.734241,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":1.14239323139,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446430724000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello, hello!

It\u2019s not enough to be the expert and know that your offer is right for your prospect. When it comes to closing deals, we have to start by eliminating the blocks that are in our way, by upgrading our mindset so it supports our sales goals and our success. Then we have to get clear on how we can distinguish ourselves through our \u201cunique assets.\u201d And here\u2019s something we often forget about: We have to be fully present in our body and in our energy. People feel that, even over the phone.

She would discover a talent for healing magic, be invited to study under Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and witness Sombra's descent into darkness.

Politicians call for more affordable housing. Yet the financial incentives available to developers encourage construction of luxury apartments. The infamous 421a tax abatements are peddled as the only way affordable housing can be provided, although examples abound to scuttle that deceit. The City\u2019s infrastructure crumbles from lack of investment. Are investor incentives destroying our city? Marty Rowland charts the mismatch between the demand for and supply of affordable housing, and offers an alternative paradigm that is fair and just. Marty Rowland studied economics under Daniel W. Bromley, emeritus professor of applied economics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and used the theories of Bromley and Elinor Ostrom on common pool resource management systems. A Georgist since his arrival in NYC in 2009, Marty is active in presenting his ideas \u2013 most recently at the John Jay College\u2019s Left Forum.

Note - lockers are quite small so if you have a lot of stuff or wear size 13 shoes like me, you may need to use two lockers - so bring two locks.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Cost:<\/b><br\/>Access to the ice skating rink is free, and so is the use of lockers (you need to bring your lock!).<br\/>However, the ice-skates rental is not free.<br\/>If you have a pair of ice skates, then you won't pay a dime; but if you do not have your own ice-skates, and can't borrow them from a friend\/relative, you'll have to rent them at the facility for $15 for a skating period (you can stay as long as you want 8AM-10PM).<br\/>If you plan on ice skating more than 2 times this season, I suggest you to purchase a pair of ice skates; there are some incredibly cheap skates out there - girls can pick up a pair for as low as $30...<br\/>Just make sure they fit you OK (thigh but not blistering tight), get the cheapest pair, and disregard all selling points salesman will try to put out there...<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Transportation:<\/b><br\/>Getting to the Bryant park is easy.<br\/>Take subway line B,D,F or M to the 42nd Street - Bryan park stop...<br\/>or 7 line to the 5th Ave stop...<br\/>or N, R, Q, 1, 2 or 3 line to the Times Square - 42nd Street stop and walk one Ave block east.<br\/>The entrance to the ice skating rink is from the south side of the park - 40th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues.<\/p> <p><b>What to wear:<\/b><br\/>What usually works best for me is a base layer top (thin, body tight, moisture wick shirt) with a warm sweater on the top, a scarf, a warm hat, and a pair of gloves; everything else stays in the locker - it could be a bit cold at first, but as soon as you start skating you'll start rolling your sleeves up; Again, this is what works for me - you may want to adjust the amount\/type of clothing to best fit your needs.<br\/>Cell phones are not permitted on the ice - if you need to make a call\/send text, you have to step off the ice.<\/p> <p><b>Checking in:<\/b><br\/>When you enter the facility you will be directed to the counter where they will ask you if you have your own skates or if you need to rent a pair, ask you to sign a waiver and give you a bracelet.<br\/>After you get the bracelet, you can proceed to the lockers area.<br\/>There are some snacks\/drinks sold at the facility but the prices are as they usually are in places like this...I recommend bringing a bottle of water\/drink and keeping it in your locker...<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/6\/8\/600_206601352.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/p> <p>Participation in activities is strictly voluntary and group members assume all risks in connection with activities; per Meetup.com's Terms of Service Agreements, organizers and hike\/trip leaders are released from any and all forms of liability related to events.Full text of our liability waiver can be found on the following page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/pages\/Risks_and_Waiver_of_Liability\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Adventure-Outlet\/events\/226716490\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Ice Skating @ Bryant Park *All Levels Welcome*","id":"226716490","time":1447889400000,"updated":1447901063000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1357706438000,"name":"Adventure Outlet","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6566782,"urlname":"Adventure-Outlet","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"978 2nd Ave. between 52nd & 53rd St.","name":"Irish Exit","lon":-73.969406,"id":5220832,"state":"NY","lat":40.757702,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.20446801186,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447443856000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/9\/d\/600_443804701.jpeg\" \/><b><br\/>Social Painting Night: Paint, Drink, Make New Friends!

Some gravitate towards those that pay a dividend in order to generate returns beyond capital appreciation. Some of us get a further kicker by selling covered calls on every long stock\/ETF position we hold, similar to the income received when one owns real estate and rents it out. The premium collected from covered calls can often generate an extra\u00a0 1-1.5% per month when done properly, equivalent to an annual yield of 12-18%. That's powerful. Plus when markets are jumpy and volatile, the return is often greater.<\/p> <p>Other advantages of covered calls are:<\/p> <p>* they can be used in either a cash account or any type of retirement account<br\/>* they lower the effective cost basis of the stock or ETF<br\/>* if you have several core holdings, each position can represents a distinct, valuable income stream, again, like owning several rental apartments<br\/>* covered calls are easy to learn and trade, and also easy to manage if market conditions change, with the proper instruction<br\/>* with the advent of weekly options, those with a good understanding of constructing covered call positions have seen their returns increase dramatically the last few years<\/p> <p><b>**Credit Spreads**<\/b><\/p> <p>Before talking about credit spreads, Frank will touch upon why the general concept of constructing a spread, i.e., a simple combination of two options, enables one to trade with an edge when properly executed.<\/p> <p>Credit spreads, the selling of one option to generate income and buying a cheaper option in order to limit and control the risk of the trade is a great strategy that knowledgeable traders use to create a reliable income stream. They are especially appealing to those seeking to manage risk, since they can be constructed with great flexibility in balancing risk vs reward and the probability of success. They are fully customizable for the individual trader.<\/p> <p>Frank will talk about selling bull-put spreads and bear-call spreads. Again, when properly done you're trading with an edge. This is because the credit spread will be successful if one of three things occur:<\/p> <p>* the underlying stock or ETF moves in a predicted direction, up or down depending on the specific trade<br\/>* it stays range-bound, i.e., moves relatively sideways<br\/>* it moves a small distance opposite from the predicted direction<\/p> <p>In baseball terms, credit spreads are analogous to hitting singles; they are limited-risk\/limited-return trades, and as such, are appealing to the risk-averse.

During the 2 and a half hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash bar. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails. We have a fun little ice breaker game that helps everyone get to meet each other where you'll get raffle tickets for a chance to win a prize! Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone).

Valve, the creator of Steam, has identified that open source offered the opportunity to potentially free itself from strong dependencies on platforms it had no control over -- Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS. This presentation aims to highlight how\u00a0Valve leverages and contributes to\u00a0free and open source software to create SteamOS, a Debian derivative focused on providing a stable and reliable OS for the\u00a0Steam Client.<\/p> <p>We will look at details from hardware enablement, Linux kernel, baseline distribution and all required customizations to produce SteamOS. This presentation will highlight how Debian derivatives can be produced to purpose-built software platforms.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Afterwards:<br\/><\/b>Join us afterwards at a nearby pub, where we'll continue the discussion over drinks and\/or food.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Speaker\u00a0Bio:<br\/><\/b> Guy Lunardi is the VP of business development at Collabora, a consultancy working exclusively on free and Open Source software.

Come on out and sip cocktails, mingle and paint a great canvas under the guidance of a master artist! During the 2 and a half hour event, you'll be crafting your masterpiece while sipping drinks that are available at the cash bar. We supply paint and brushes, canvases, easels, and aprons. Halfway through the class we take a 20 minute break to mingle a bit while having a few cocktails. We have a fun little ice breaker game that helps everyone get to meet each other where you'll get raffle tickets for a chance to win a prize! Our icebreaker is free flowing and fun (not rigid or overly structured).<\/p> <p><i>This event is for singles but we don't gender balance it... meaning that sometimes we have more of one gender at the event. You'll have a great night out meeting like-minded fun new friends (Wing men\/women to do other fun things with and who knows, you may even end up meeting that special someone). Typically about 75% of attendees of this event come alone and 25% bring friends. Singles ages 20s, 30s &amp; 40s are welcome to attend.<\/i><\/p> <p>There is a 1 drink minimum at this event. If you don't drink alcohol you are welcome to order juice\/soda or something off the food\/appetizer menu.<\/p> <p>Oh - here's a quick note to the men. Guys... this event has been called, \"A secret gem. One of the best places to meet fun, quality women in NYC\".

But humans are also responsible for creating that which we do not desire to experience. However, being co-creators with God, the quality of our thoughts, beliefs, and intentions will determine and manifest our world. There is work to do, and those who are on the path with knowledge of God\u2019s attributes and God\u2019s laws, and with love and good will in their hearts, will do that work.

Grapes were sourced from several select Sonoma Coast vineyards including the \"A-list\" Sangiacomo Vineyard, vineyards belonging to the Dutton and Martinelli estates, and MacRostie's own estate properties. The beautifully ripe &amp; pristine fruit was whole-cluster pressed into 20% new French oak for fermentation where it aged for an additional 6 months. A few lots were fermented in stainless steel to retain some special emphasis on aromatic fruit characteristics. This 2013 bottling has not yet been professionally reviewed, but the similarly styled 2012 vintage garnered 92 points and a \"Best Buy\" designation from Wines &amp; Spirits.<\/p> <p>The wine is pale straw gold in color. Delicate floral aromas introduce this wine followed by lemon citrus and peach stone fruit notes. This wine has a soft entry with an essence of spice from a pie crust and candied orange peel flavors. There is pronounced weight in the mid-palate and finishes with a crisp yet lasting lemon citrus zest on the tongue.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>ORIGIN<\/b><br\/>The grapes for this Chardonnay came from several excellent vineyards in Sonoma County. Sangiacomo and Champlin Creek vineyards are located in the Carneros region. We work with some amazing Russian River Valley properties as well, including vineyards owned by the well-known Dutton family &amp; Martinelli family. Wildcat Mountain Vineyard, a signature site for MacRostie, is high up in the hills &amp; considered part of the Petaluma Gap region in Sonoma. All of our vineyards are located in unique cool climate areas of the Sonoma Coast appellation &amp; offer distinct and complex characteristics to our Sonoma Coast Chardonnay.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>VINEYARD NOTES<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>2013 had ideal temperatures and growing conditions. The fruit came in the door healthy, ripe and luscious. All of the grapes destined for the Sonoma Coast Chardonnay blend were harvested by hand between September 4th and October 9th of 2013.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>VINIFICATION<\/b><br\/>All grapes went direct to press as whole clusters and then gently pressed. By pressing as whole clusters we can keep the wines delicate and bright. After settling, most of the juice was racked into French oak barrels for fermentation, 20% of which were new. Once the wines completed primary fermentation and a secondary, malo-lactic fermentation, the barrel-fermented lots were aged on the lees for six months, with occasional stirring to increase richness and body. To emphasize fruit aromatics a select few lots were fermented in stainless steel tanks and never went to barrel. The final blend was assembled prior to bottling, which ran the first two weeks of June 2014. This vintage produced about 32,000 (750 ml) cases. MacRostie Winery &amp; Vineyards was founded by winemaker Steve MacRostie in 1987. As a believer in the unique character of Sonoma Coast fruit &amp; an innovative winemaker pioneering a more fresh &amp; sophisticated style of Chardonnay, Steve dedicated himself to crafting wines with an authentic sense of place &amp; championed quality in the region, both in the vineyards &amp; the winery.<\/p> <p><b>Sonoma Coast\u2026<\/b> Two words that together sum up the wines that Steve MacRostie has been producing since 1987. Sonoma, the town, is his longtime home. Sonoma, the county, may be the most diverse and distinctive wine-growing region in California\u2014a viticultural candy store, where great vineyards growing virtually every renowned variety can be found in abundance. And everyone knows what coast means\u2014sunny, cool, breezy &amp; beautiful. Combine these elements &amp; you have a winemaking paradise. The very first wine that MacRostie made was from a vineyard in the Sonoma Coast region &amp; this area has continued to play a large role in almost every bottling since.<\/p> <p>Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noir show their true potential in the Sonoma Coast, and these are the varieties upon which MacRostie winery focuses its attention. The extended growing season in this marine-influenced climate allows these varieties to mature slowly &amp; completely, developing exceptional depth of flavor that can then be captured in the resulting wines. Long convinced of the region\u2019s greatness, MacRostie planted his estate vineyard, Wildcat Mountain, here in 1998, and this vineyard has since become the jewel in the winery\u2019s crown. MacRostie wines are made in a gentle, natural way, because when the grapes are this good, there\u2019s not much need to intervene. We let our vineyards speak for themselves.<\/p> <p><b>MacRostie\u2019s winery operation is Certified by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance (CSWA)<\/b>, a nonprofit organization created by the Wine Institute and the California Association of Winegrape Growers. In addition, MacRostie is certified as a California Green Business \u2014 a government program that recognizes &amp; assists businesses that operate in an environmentally friendly manner. \u201cOur efforts to conserve water, energy, and other resources are in line with keeping Sonoma the beautiful natural place it is today.\u201d Steve MacRostie<\/p> <p>The team at MacRostie Winery has been working towards decreasing our energy and water usage.

While fresh &amp; enticing now, this wine promises to build mid-palate richness with time in the bottle to yield a truly sublime experience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The season started out unusually cool, delaying grape flowering until well into July. Even then, the weather was not great and poor pollination produced smaller than average clusters. Even then we were compelled to remove grape clusters to get the yields well below average. There is just not enough growing season left to ripen a normal crop. A season saving string of 80+ degree days at the end of September gave us all hope of ripening and put life back into our plans to make red wine. A bit of warm, soaking rain in early October sent us into further removing leaves and working to keep fruit healthy. Mid-October brought an great, dry forecast and harvest began with a bang to beat predicted October 23rd rains. Red wine was harvested with gusto beginning the 17th and we wrapped up harvest the 21st October. Keys to our success were, small crop, healthy fruit, and patience to wait until the very end of the season to pick.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Wine Production Stats <\/b><br\/>Varietal: 100% Oregon Chardonnay, Dijon clone; Vineyard: Lone Star AVA: Eola-Amity Hills; Alcohol: 13.0%;<br\/>Cases Produced: 916; Winemakers: Rollin Soles and Andrew Davis<\/p> <p><b>Argyle Pinot Noir 2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 on sale \u00a0 \u00a0 $22.98<\/b><br\/>Willamette Valley, Oregon<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dvwinepartners.com\">www.dvwinepartners.com<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.argylewinery.com\">www.argylewinery.com<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2012 Vintage:<br\/>90 Pts \u2013 Wine Spectator<\/b><br\/>\"Lithe, with a nice transparency to the polished texture &amp; the tea leaf-accented cherry &amp; herb flavors, sliding easily into a graceful finish.

Towards the end of September, just after our sparkling harvest, the forecast seemed more ominous and hardly believable. Argyle\u2019s experience and maturity paid big dividends against such a backdrop. As the certainty of the forecast increased, we went to the whip at low elevations, particularly our Lone Star Vineyard. After the initial blitzkrieg, we hunkered down and received 6 inches of rain in a weekend. We caught our breath and waited, almost a full week. Following the rain there was another flurry of action, as we went to work dropping any compromised fruit. Yields were certainly diminished but as the end of September blew over, we were blessed with a dry, sunny October.

Prior to October 1st, there had not been a day over 100 degrees in our region, making for an ideal, evenly paced growing season. Then the weather warmed up which ushered all of our remaining grapes to optimal ripeness. Neither rain nor the threat of rain were ever factors which ensured ideal picking decisions.

In 1987, they staked a claim in Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley, a place ideal for late season ripened Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Argyle Winery is a Grower First, producing world-class Method\u00e9 Champenoise Sparkling wine, barrel fermented Chardonnay and silky textured Pinot Noir from low yielding vines on Argyle-farmed hillside slopes.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A TALE OF TWO HOUSES\u2026<br\/>THE SPIRITHOUSE STORY<\/b><br\/>Argyle\u2019s Victorian farmhouse tasting room was dubbed \u201c The Spirithouse\u201d in tribute to the ghost of an early 1900\u2019s Dundee pioneer woman said to roam the halls.

Spirithouse Pinot Noir &amp; Spirithouse Chardonnay honor the friendly ghost.<\/p> <p><b>THE NUTHOUSE STORY<\/b><br\/>The Willamette Valley is also famous for its hazelnuts (Filberts, that is, if you want to fit in with the locals!) Argyle built its modern winery facility on what was originally a hazelnut processing plant. As a tribute to its history, Argyle established the\u00a0limited production - \u201cNuthouse\u201d Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noir in keeping with our \u201csquirrel friendly\u201d heritage.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/c\/600_443821356.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Founded in 1987 by Sonoma County winemaking pioneer &amp; Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noir specialist, Steve MacRostie, MacRostie Winery &amp; Vineyards has established itself as one of the Sonoma Coast\u2019s defining wineries &amp; a leader in a bright, balanced &amp; age-worthy style of Chardonnay &amp; Pinot Noir. Using grapes farmed by legendary winegrowing families, including the Duttons, Sangiacomos, Martinellis &amp; Bacigalupis, &amp; from Steve\u2019s own Wildcat Mountain Vineyard in the mountainous Petaluma Gap region, MacRostie has assembled one of the Sonoma Coast\u2019s most acclaimed &amp; diverse vineyard programs.<\/p> <p><b>Steve MacRostie, Founder <\/b><br\/>Since beginning his winemaking career 37 years ago, Steve MacRostie has developed a reputation as one of California\u2019s most respected veteran winemakers. At the same time he has helped to pioneer the use of fruit from both Carneros and the Sonoma Coast. As the founder and original winemaker for MacRostie Winery and Vineyards, Steve has earned wide acclaim for crafting balanced wines, with an emphasis on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A native Californian, Steve was born in Pasadena and raised in Sacramento. In the process of preparing for medical school, he earned a degree in biology from Washington\u2019s Whitman College in 1968. Following his time at Whitman, Steve served in the U.S. Army, which trained him as a cryptographer and deployed him to Vicenza in the Veneto region of Italy. While in Europe, Steve took advantage of the opportunity to travel to France, Germany and Spain. European wines were an epiphany for him \u2013 far surpassing the few American wines he had tasted \u2013 and he quickly fell in love with wine, and the idea of winemaking.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Following the adventurous spirit that would inform many future decisions, Steve soon abandoned the idea of a career in medicine, and instead enrolled in the enology program at the University of California, Davis. Upon graduation in 1974, Steve joined Sonoma County\u2019s Hacienda Winery as its inaugural winemaker. While at Hacienda, Steve refined his skills, quickly gaining renown as a winemaker capable of crafting benchmark Chardonnays and age-worthy Pinot Noirs. At the same time, he began greatly appreciating the fruit he was working with from a few exceptional small vineyards\u2014all located in an area that would later gain appellation status as Carneros.\u00a0<\/p> <p>After 12 years with Hacienda, Steve felt that he had enough experience to put his own name on a wine. In 1987, with the support of his wife Thale, Steve founded MacRostie Winery and Vineyards. As a winemaker, Steve focused on Carneros grapes to craft fresh and elegant cool-climate wines\u2014at the time, an innovative approach. While pioneering this more sophisticated style, Steve continued building relationships with top growers throughout the region that have lasted for decades.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In 1997, Steve made another pivotal decision with the establishment of his Wildcat Mountain Vineyard on the borderlands of Carneros and the Sonoma Coast. This partnership with ranchers Nancy and Tony Lilly has solidified Steve\u2019s reputation as a winemaking and viticultural leader in both Carneros and the Sonoma Coast. While Steve is still active in every facet of MacRostie Winery and Vineyards, including the blending process, he now focuses his considerable energies on the development of Wildcat Mountain Vineyard, while also acting as vineyard liaison with the winery\u2019s coveted portfolio of growers. In 2004, Steve handpicked Kevin Holt as MacRostie\u2019s winemaker.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A longtime advocate on behalf of Sonoma County, and Sonoma Valley (where he lives), Steve has served as president of the Sonoma Valley Vintners and Growers Alliance, the Carneros Wine Alliance and the Carneros Quality Alliance.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Heidi Bridenhagen, Winemaker<\/b><br\/>An up-and-coming superstar of the wine industry, Heidi has seven years of winemaking experience including harvests at California\u2019s Kendall Jackson and Clos du Bois and New Zealand\u2019s Oyster Bay (Delegate\u2019s Wine Estates). Heidi\u2019s former position as Enologist at the famed SonomaCutrer Winery provided the foundation for her strong passion for the region and Chardonnay and Pinot Noir winemaking. \u201cThese two varietals show their true potential in the Sonoma Coast. The extended growing season in this marine influenced climate allows these varieties to mature slowly and completely, developing exceptional depth of flavor that can then be captured in our MacRostie wines.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Heidi brings this passion to MacRostie and has focused on building a small portfolio of partner growers during her two years as Enologist and Winemaker. \u201cOur partnerships with these iconic small vineyards, who are committed to sustainable farming methods, contribute to the success and quality of our Sonoma Coast blends.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Heidi has intimate knowledge of each individual lot and the various layers they contribute to the wine. \u201cWhen I taste MacRostie\u2019s Sonoma Coast Chardonnay, I get a mineral edge from vineyards in the far west, floral and lemon notes from vineyards on the valley floor, and a phenolic complexity from our foggy, windy estate Wildcat Mountain Vineyard on the south-western corner of Carneros\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Heidi has a very \u201chands-on\u201d approach in the cellar and out in the vineyards, from sustainability projects to lab analysis, blending and bottling. Heidi is involved in all facets of winemaking to ensure the highest quality fruit, optimal harvest time and crafting award-winning, unique wines expressive of Sonoma Coast.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A native of Door County, WI, Heidi has a Bachelor of Arts in Biochemistry from the University of Colorado at Boulder. In addition to travel (including an eight month stint in Europe) Heidi enjoys tee time, winter sports, experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes and wine pairings, and hitting up local breweries for craft beer tasting.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/6\/2\/600_444144674.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Born &amp; educated in New Zealand, <b>Nick Goldschmidt\u2019s<\/b> career began in 1982 with a research position at the New Zealand Lincoln University where he graduated with Distinction in Horticulture.

She has a Masters in Game Design from NYU, and her thesis project, an online asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, \u201cThe Curse of Mannequin Island\u201d was shown at the Tokyo Game Show. Her experience ranges from game design to illustration and art direction. She\u2019s originally from Mexico City where she worked on multiple mobile games including a Hot Wheels mobile game. She also worked at Walt Disney World in the art department of Creative Entertainment where she learned to love physical design. Most recently she worked as a game designer at Turbo Studios. She is co-founder of Women in Games International NYC Chapter, which focuses on democratizing knowledge, opening the space for conversation and creating an inclusive community.<\/p> <p>\n\nAbout the panelists:<\/p> <p><br\/>Jane Friedhoff<\/p> <p><br\/>Jane Friedhoff is a riot grrrl game designer and creative technologist who loves exploring how games can create new, unusual, and surprising relationships between people \u00a0She co-founded the Code Liberation Foundation, which provides free, trans-inclusive, women-only game design and programming classes.

In her previous role as President of Hide&amp;Seek New York, Margaret made big games (like the city-wide 12,000 player New Year Games), small games (like the Tiny Games project), silly games (like Drunk Dungeon) and serious games (like Dreams Of Your Life). Her earlier work as an independent consultant enabled her to contribute to a huge range of projects, from AAA console titles, through download and mobile\/ handheld games, to indie and art-house projects. She's worked with brands, broadcasters, and film studios to develop their game strategies, and was part of the team that built the Channel 4\u2018s BAFTA- and Emmy-award winning educational game slate. Previously editor-in-chief of Edge magazine, and a co-chair of Indiecade East, she is an internationally top-rated speaker on game design theory.<\/p> <p><br\/>Asia Hoe<\/p> <p><br\/>Asia is a Product Designer at 2U, a company that designs experiences for advanced online degrees at world class universities.

She enjoys streaming on Twitch and studying game design and development. Collaborating with friends at Brooklyn Gamery at the Global Game Jam in 2014, she helped design Five Stages, a game about breakups through the lens of the 5 stages of grief. A regular volunteer with Code Liberation and Games 4 Change, Asia is passionate about bringing the joy of games to all.<\/p> <p><br\/>Cindy Chow<\/p> <p><br\/>Cindy was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, Canada during the great video game resurgence of the mid-80's, and lives and breathes gaming. Having extensive volunteer experience at the prestigious Vancouver Film School, as well as being a pivotal member of Canada's Women in Games Chapter, Cindy recently co-founded New York's own WIGI Chapter to promote awareness and inclusion in the gaming community. Career-wise, Cindy has held administrative positions at Blue Castle, Capcom and Slant Six before moving Vancouver's East Side Games where she found her true passion, working in Community Management. She recently moved to New York to be the Community Manager at TURBO Studios. When not running Nightfall Strikes in Destiny or cooking up Mirelurk steaks in Fallout 4, Cindy can be found consuming a Shack Burger with cheese fries while trying to beat her forever increasing Threes score.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nFind out more about WIGI NYC at: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WIGINYC\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WIGINYC\/\"

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/226280795\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklytpbxb","time":1447891200000,"updated":1447905291000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07030","country":"us","city":"Hoboken","address_1":"38 Jackson St","name":"Hoboken MakerBar","lon":-74.041794,"id":11759542,"state":"NJ","lat":40.737305,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.85547924042,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1353099561000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Soldering Wednesday is the perfect open event if you don't have a project - drop by, pick up a kit, and make something cool with our members at your side.<\/p> <p>No obligation to buy a kit - bring your own project and hack with the MakerBar community.<\/p> <p>Current kit menu:<\/p> <p>The TV-B-Gone - A universal remote that turns off any television.
