The goal is to form a group of\u00a0 about 6-8 core members who meet on Friday nights from about 7pm until about 9pm at least once or twice every month.

Why article rather than book discussion group then? A book discussion group is not for people who take books seriously, i.e.\u00a0\u201chave a sense of purpose for reading\u201d (Daniel Bell). They cannot take a detour from the reading path defined by their own questions and interests even for sake of finding people they speak the same language with. An article discussion group allows finding people of the same quality as a book group while making much lesser demand on your reading time.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>A serious magazine or newspaper seems to be the only place where you can find intelligent life in public space. Good periodicals might be the only link between people who think. This is the reason for creating the meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n This group is for readers who from time to time come across a fascinating article and want to discuss it with others both for better understanding of things and for pleasure of being with people who share your interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n I am talking about an occasional outstanding article with eye-opening analysis or a review of a great book (just published or classic), not about daily reporting.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For sake of describing this group I\u2019d like to restate the obvious - a few of many things that one may get from a good newspaper if he goes past news:<br>\n\n 1. Understanding political world we live in - insightful analysis of major issues of politics \u2013 both domestic and foreign;<br>\n\n 2. Opportunity to hear people with greater wisdom and knowledge than your own (in our interactions in person we are usually limited to people of our own level);<br>\n\n 3. Invaluable tips for continuing study of Humanities on your own;<br>\n\n 4. Knowledge for dealing with earthly problems of our lives.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It is easy to miss and never discover articles and tips about books that would be of most interest to you or even \u201cchange your life\u201d because there are too many worthy newspapers and magazines for one person to keep up with. It is another reason for this meetup.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Articles will not be limited to current ones. Selection criteria are topic and quality - publication date does not matter \u2013 we will be discussing pieces that are \u201ctimeless\u201d.<br>\n\n A sample list of articles that follows this description will give you an idea of what kind of things we may discuss. People with a different range of interests who like the idea of this group may want to create meetups that reflect their interests.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Technically this group is limited to discussion of articles, but in reality it should allow discussing any topic that may interest you because over years your favorite newspapers and magazines most likely have had an article on anything you can ever think of.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Periodicals do have online forums, but they are a poor ersatz for a conversation in person and a poor tool for selecting people to talk to (before joining this meetup you will be offered a few questions to determine if the group matches your interests). Unfortunately there are no gathering places for those who want to meet people to discuss works of journalism. This group is designed to serve a role of such place.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Basics on how the group will operate<\/b><br>\n\n 1. The leader will select an article (or a few) for a discussion using recommendations of the group and his own findings and post the selection approximately two weeks before a meeting. In addition to discussing articles we may want to share tips about articles and books that we find interesting.<br>\n\n 2. We will restrict freedom of speech by a 2-3 min. limit per person per comment except instances when the group wants to hear more. Taking numbers might be another good idea.<br>\n\n 3. Initial plan is to meet once a month \u2013 most likely we will be meeting on Mondays.<br>\n\n 4. Meetings will be held in Manhattan.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>Sample articles<\/b><br>\n\n List of abbreviations:<br>\n\n NYT - New Your Times<br>\n\n WSJ \u2013 Wall Street Journal<br>\n\n FT \u2013 Financial Times<br>\n\n<br>\n\n 0.\u00a0The Truth About Our Libertarian Age By Mark Lilla -\u00a0newrepublic.com June 17, 2014<br>\n\n 1.

It\u2019s a 2-1\/2 hour drawing session with a little social time before. &nbsp;Everyone cleans up after.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Full nudity of all participants is required for the duration of the session.&nbsp;Tuesday venue: footwear is recommended when not on the model stand.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; All artists should be willing to pose on the model stand. First-timers are not required to pose. There are usually more artists than posing slots so not everyone will pose. Sign up for single\/duo\/3-person poses. Erotic\/sensual\/sexualized poses on the model stand welcome (see FAQ below re erotic poses).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Creating interesting poses is the group\u2019s collective responsibility. Each artist should think about his possible poses in advance while the other artists should offer friendly suggestions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; There is no instruction. Bring all your own materials, drawing boards, portable easels, etc. There is a sink available for rinsing your brushes.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Artists are encouraged to share their work by taping their work to the wall as the session progresses. If you are drawing in a notebook, please share them with whoever is taking the artwork photos at the session. We will photograph drawings to post on social media. We want this to be social (not formal). While we want to improve our artwork, we want to have fun doing it. Don't forget to take your drawings home with you!<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Photography of persons without permission is prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Sexual activity (other than while posing) prohibited anywhere in the building; this is not a hook-up event.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; Bring a towel or sit on your shirt.

Our default is to post artwork only without any identification. It's okay to decline but still fill out a form.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Priority RSVP and \"no-show\" policy<\/b> (new 7\/27\/2015):<\/p>\n<p> To reward regular attendance and reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d, we are implementing priority RSVPs similar to airline priority seating.

Is there any instruction? There is no instruction, but beginner artists are welcome to try us out as long as you have the interest and make the effort to draw. There will be special sessions with instruction from a naked teacher; please check the schedule.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b> I've never been to a naked event before.<\/b> What's it like?&nbsp;We're a friendly bunch and nonjudgmental. We have a wide range of ages and body types. There are usually about 20 artists. Everyone gets fully undressed (except for footwear depending on venue) after checking in\/paying the fee and stays naked for the entire session. It's quite natural and relaxed. <i><b>However, unlike a typical, strictly non-sexual naturist activity, there IS some sexual energy. <\/b>Please read the entire FAQ.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>Do I need to bring my own supplies?<\/b> What is provided? You must bring all your own supplies (paper\/pads, pencils, drawing boards, easels, etc). Most guys draw on pads on their laps. The studio provides chairs, and running water.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>I've never posed before.<\/b> Many of our members had never posed before joining our group. We're a friendly and relaxed group, so no need to stress out about it. It might be easier to pose together with someone else to start. We have 2-person poses to accommodate this.&nbsp;<span>First-timers are encouraged to but are not required to pose.&nbsp;<\/span><span>Not everyone poses every session. We have about 10 posing slots per session. There is a sign-up sheet for poses (varying lengths 5-20mins) at the beginning of each session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp; <b>What's an erotic pose?<\/b>&nbsp;Poses are&nbsp;up to each artist posing.&nbsp;We're a naked drawing group where erotic poses are welcome but not required.&nbsp;They can be classical, athletic, dance-like, sexy, etc. Erotic\/sexualized poses can simulate sexual acts like masturbating, etc. We're open-minded but don't move&nbsp;too much. It's not a performance piece. If you drip, etc. please wipe off the model stand. Each venue has different guidelines on what's acceptable - this will be announced before each session.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Is this a gay group?<\/b>&nbsp;Many of our members are gay, but we are open to men regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, we don't talk about it much. However, some artists create poses that are homoerotic\/sexualized so you should be comfortable with that.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>What's the sexual energy of the group like?<\/b>&nbsp;The sexual energy level varies quite a bit depending on who shows up.<\/p>\n<b>What if I get an erection?<\/b>&nbsp;Erections are natural and are welcome. However, when you're socializing or supposed to be drawing, masturbating is not okay.\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Who keeps the drawings that I posed for?<\/b>&nbsp;<span>Each artist keeps his own drawings.

There are so many issues affecting gay or same-gender loving (SGL) men as individuals, and many issues that come up when two (or more) gay\/SGL men come together to form a relationship. These include issues like coming out\/family acceptance; differences in values, priorities and habits; sex, monogamy and sexual or romantic openness; addiction and recovery; financial and life planning issues; health and aging. I have been in a relationship for 25 years and all of these issues have come up. Time and again, my partner and I have felt isolated in wrestling with these issues. I have also had many gay male friends in relationships who have brought these issues up with me in private (and mostly tortured) conversation. Aside from expensive couples counseling, there doesn't seem to be a forum or group for gay male couples partners to share their experiences, seek feedback, ideas and support and offer some in return. (With the group's collective approval, there may be opportunity for a therapist\/facilitator seasoned in the issues and experiences of gay men and couples to help guide the discussion.)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/highres_432311982.jpeg","photo_id":432311982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/600_432311982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/c\/e\/thumb_432311982.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8999930,"name":"Angelo Ragaza"},"members":119,"name":"New York Gay Male Couples Support Meetup","id":18243198,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Gay-Male-Couples-Support-Meetup","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1418166868000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"storytelling","name":"Storytelling","id":9429},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"telling-your-story","name":"Telling Your Story","id":18029},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"dating-again","name":"Dating Again","id":20814},{"urlkey":"non-fiction-writing","name":"Non-fiction writing","id":31732},{"urlkey":"short-story-writing","name":"Short Story Writing","id":35414},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shy-singles\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Introverted?

Once freed from the need to change ourselves or others, we can devote all our thoughts to sharing our love and creativity, and there are an infinite variety of ways we can be kind and helpful to one another. In fact, it is only through sharing our inner creativity and unconditional love that we remember and realize our limitlessness.\n\nTo this end we envision hosting documentary film screenings, mixers, lectures, fundraisers, panel discussions, Q&As, and, perhaps later, organizing and\/or participating in various social good projects. We value diversity and inclusivity  and invite you to share your voice with the community.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1164150,"name":"Christopher Pelham"},"members":245,"name":"Spirituality & Social Change Meetup","id":18263547,"state":"NY","urlname":"Spirituality-Social-Change-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Spiritual Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419034483000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"appreciate-and-enjoy-music-concerts","name":"Appreciate and Enjoy Music Concerts","id":23349},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548},{"urlkey":"laughter-fun-and-friendship","name":"Laughter Fun and Friendship.","id":89179}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EnjoyLife\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A community of people dedicated to enjoying life by any means necessary.

At least to start anyway. We never start out at a bar, but we often end up at one; however, drinking is not a requirement. As a matter of fact, many of our members do not drink at all, but some do. <\/p> \n<p>Date Walks consist of men and women in a certain age range. We walk and talk while exploring nice outdoor locations such as waterfronts, parks, food festivals, art fairs and the like. Sometimes we do day stuff and sometimes we do night stuff and usually on the weekends. Every 6 or so minutes I ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken with until everyone has spoken with everyone. I usually take the group to a bar\/restaurant for further bonding. Date Walking really is the easiest way to meet someone special.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Some of my more popular and repeating Date Walks are:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>\u25ba Big Group Brooklyn Bridge Sunset Singles Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Central Park Singles Stroll <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles 3-Bridge Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Roosevelt Island Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Stroll around Astoria <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Sunset Walk on the High Line <br>\u25ba Big Group Date Walk for Dog Lovers &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Thank you, <br> Beau, your Date Walking Organizer <br> &nbsp; <br> Call\/Text: 347-225-3516 <br> Email: datewalking@gmail.com<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/datewalking\">Date Walking<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/datewalking\">Facebook<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/datewalking\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>I've tried Plenty of Fish, OKcupid, Coffee meets Bagel, Craigslist, Tinder and so on and it's the same thing every time: a little bit of back-and-forth communication that eventually diminishes to nothing. Either that or you actually meet a person here and a person there and there's no chemistry so it's over. More wasted time. I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't. With Date Walking you know.<\/i><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/highres_432804863.jpeg","photo_id":432804863,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/600_432804863.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/1\/f\/thumb_432804863.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":27685862,"name":"Beau"},"members":1704,"name":"Date Walking - The Easiest Way to Meet Someone Special","id":18268721,"state":"NY","urlname":"datewalking","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Singles"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419279254000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"marathon","name":"Marathon","id":401},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"paris","name":"Paris","id":24767},{"urlkey":"americans-in-paris","name":"Americans in Paris","id":79688},{"urlkey":"running-beginning-train-for-a-marathon","name":"Running: Beginning Train for a Marathon","id":82464},{"urlkey":"running-training","name":"running training","id":99282},{"urlkey":"beginner-marathon-training","name":"Beginner Marathon Training","id":435542}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Marathon-Meetup-for-Paris-39th-2015-Marathon\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for everyone who enjoys running, outdoor activity, traveling, meeting new people, and most importantly who's getting ready for Paris 2015 Marathon.<br>\n\n If you are planning to run Paris 2015 Marathon and want to meet others, who are planning to do the same, please join the group and let's get ready for this wonderful event together.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10786940,"name":"Kasey"},"members":14,"name":"New York Marathon Meetup for Paris 39th 2015 Marathon","id":18268818,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Marathon-Meetup-for-Paris-39th-2015-Marathon","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Paris Marathoners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419279556000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"breathing-exercises","name":"Breathing Exercises","id":19168},{"urlkey":"breathing-meditation","name":"Breathing Meditation","id":19570},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"breathing-stretching","name":"Breathing & Stretching","id":42253},{"urlkey":"breathing","name":"Breathing","id":47627},{"urlkey":"conscious-breathing","name":"Conscious Breathing","id":60933},{"urlkey":"breathing-and-relaxation","name":"Breathing and Relaxation","id":105694},{"urlkey":"breathing-and-meditation","name":"Breathing and Meditation","id":130917}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Breathwork\/","rating":5,"description":"Brooklyn Breathwork is a monthly gathering that honors the sacred gift of life through the gentle and transformative modality of rebirthing breathwork. \n\nAll evenings are by donation with a suggested donation of $20 per person.

I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient. See you at the movies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: I appreciate yearly dues of $5.00 which are given to me at first meetup.<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and do not show up and do not notify us, you will be removed.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production.

What better way to exercise that fun bone than traveling the world with friends and family, meeting some fun and amazing people, and participating in fun filled excursions. Best part about it is that you decide what fun is for you. What does freedom mean to you? Freedom from mediocrity. Maybe you are time broke, always working and never have time with family. Maybe you have too much time and no money to do the things you love to do. Everyone could use a little extra money or a lot of extra money. One thing is for sure, we would all love more quality time with family and friends. You decide what you would like to be free from or free to do. Here's my favorite part of what we are centered around; fulfillment. What would make you feel fulfilled in life? What are your dreams and aspirations in life? What if you surrounded yourself around goal-oriented, ambitious and hard-working individuals, is it safe to say your lifestyle will change for the better?

Make sure you are able to make it to an event to which you RSVP and if you anticipate a conflict or being late, give us a heads up. We understand that things come up and life interferes, but please do your best. ;)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*If you find that you can't make it to something you've signed up for -- CHANGE YOUR RSVP as soon as possible, or call\/text\/message an organizer\/event host if it is within 2 hours of the event.

If you don't show up AND make no effort to let the Event Planner know what happened --- that's a \"NO SHOW\".<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*No Show\/Late Cancel policy: If you have a history of doing this (we keep track of attendance on your profile), we won't be able to count on you to show up when you say you are going to.

For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive).

Komen has played a critical role in every major advance in the fight against breast cancer - transforming how the world talks about and treats this disease and helping to turn millions of breast cancer patients into breast cancer survivors.

However, we also know that inconsiderate RSVPs spoil the experience for everyone. For most events we will charge a $1 maintenance fee, this is not to make money. &nbsp;The money goes toward the group and covers the monthly website fee. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2) ATTENDANCE: Most events will be first come first serve. If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you fail to do so or RSVP and do not show up, you will be temporarily suspended from the next meetup. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance.

The constant headlines of change and disruption is enough to leave anyone with more questions than answers.<\/p>\n<p>While its natural to internalize and apply ones thinking to his\/her own interests, experts agree that it's also important to understand a view that is larger than that which transcends our own interests. The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us. Stay tuned for our first monthly meetup happening soon! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/highres_435397559.jpeg","photo_id":435397559,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/600_435397559.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/7\/thumb_435397559.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":16428041,"name":"Todd Barrish"},"members":18,"name":"Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp","id":18393038,"state":"NY","urlname":"Lower-Manhattan-Tech-MeetUp","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Lower Manhattan Tech Enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422557843000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"advertising","name":"Advertising","id":690},{"urlkey":"media","name":"Media","id":1702},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/jaysuites\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>\u201cThis is a group for anyone interested in meeting fellow members at Jay Suites but also businesses and entrepreneurs in the area that want to meet and network with like-minded people. \u201d<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":15453801,"name":"Paulo Munera"},"members":4,"name":"Jay Suites Meetup","id":18393074,"state":"NY","urlname":"jaysuites","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422560383000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"couples","name":"Couples","id":3250},{"urlkey":"tango","name":"Tango","id":3475},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"argentine-tango","name":"Argentine Tango","id":20559},{"urlkey":"married-couples","name":"Married Couples","id":22353},{"urlkey":"tango-music","name":"Tango Music","id":22394},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"young-married-couples","name":"Young Married Couples","id":45154},{"urlkey":"tango-lovers","name":"Tango Lovers","id":111162}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Date-Nights-Out\/","rating":0,"description":"Looking for something to do with that special someone to spice up your date night?

Or share a pint and discuss our favorite Sherlock Holmes' story at one of many Irish\/English pubs in the area? &nbsp;Maybe we will take a carriage ride through Central Park to discuss Sherlock Holmes' typical mode of transportation? &nbsp;Join us and see where it goes.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/4\/b\/highres_433826443.jpeg","photo_id":433826443,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/4\/b\/600_433826443.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/4\/b\/thumb_433826443.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":40568852,"name":"Daniel Martin"},"members":41,"name":"New York Irregulars","id":18394372,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Irregulars","category":{"name":"literature\/writing","id":18,"shortname":"literature-writing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Watsons"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422600608000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"expat","name":"Expat","id":4446},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"walking-tours","name":"Walking Tours","id":19605},{"urlkey":"language-exchange","name":"Language Exchange","id":26212},{"urlkey":"international-friends","name":"International Friends","id":50881},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/International-Connection-Travel-Meetup-NYC-world\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for everyone to connect -wherever you are!

I'm Francesca - a 45 year old mom living in Maplewood. As a plus-sized woman, it's harder for me to find a network of like-minded women who come across the same challenges as I do in life... everything from shopping for clothes, to fitting in movie theater seats, to exercise. Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!
