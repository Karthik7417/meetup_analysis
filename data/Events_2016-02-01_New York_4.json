Our meetings are casual and informal; all levels of interest and experience are welcome. When possible, we\u2019ll have copies of the current book available at no cost. Meetings occur on the second Wednesday and fourth Thursday of the month unless otherwise noted.

His novel The Radetzky March, which appeared two years later, is almost universally recognized as a classic. Yet Roth\u2019s earlier work, in which he probingly examined the upheavals of his time\u2014particularly the Russian revolution\u2014have only recently been rediscovered. In the United States, a new anthology of his early reportage, The Hotel Years, has just been published by New Directions, and in Germany his newly published essays on Russia have been celebrated by critics and readers alike. Are we experiencing an international Roth Renaissance? Jan B\u00fcrger and George Prochnik will discuss one of the most important and enigmatic writers of the modern era, and provide insights into his astonishing body of work with the aid of manuscripts and letters from the Leo Baeck Institute, New York, and the German Literature Archive, Marbach. Jan B\u00fcrger is a literary scholar and author. He wrote his dissertation about Hans Henny Jahnn, belongs to the founding editors of the Berlin journal Literaturen, and has worked since 2002 at the German Literature Archive. In addition to numerous contributions to journals and newspapers (including Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he has written Der gestrandete Wal: Das ma\u00dflose Leben des Hans Henny Jahnn (2003), Benns Doppelleben oder wie man sich selbst zusammensetzt (2006), Max Frisch: Das Tagebuch (2011) and Der Neckar: Eine literarische Reise (2013). He is also the editor of a number of events including Ich bin nicht innerlich.

You need to go BEYOND goal setting. What's missing? Start with your DREAMS before \"IMAGING\" the specific goals you desire. The EXTRA-ENERGY to work on NEW goals while still handling daily life is the missing piece. Your goals need emotional energy to work. Where to find more energy?<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe amount of energy you can tap is not fixed!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe starting line for health,happiness and life focus is energy. Where can you possibly find more energy? You already eat healthy and exercise regularly. We feel rushed all the time and lose touch with our dreams. Because of stress overload from the rapid pace of modern life our dreams become boxed up inside of our heads. Everyone loves the experience of UNBOXING a new toy.

You need to go BEYOND goal setting. What's missing? Start with your DREAMS before \"IMAGING\" the specific goals you desire. The EXTRA-ENERGY to work on NEW goals while still handling daily life is the missing piece. Your goals need emotional energy to work. Where to find more energy?<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe amount of energy you can tap is not fixed!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe starting line for health,happiness and life focus is energy. Where can you possibly find more energy? You already eat healthy and exercise regularly. We feel rushed all the time and lose touch with our dreams.

We even love watching others UNBOXING their new toys on YouTube. There is an excitement and adventure about what's possible with a new toy. Have you fully unboxed your dreams? You won't have full energy until you have unboxed your dreams. Dream energy when unboxed provides a wellspring of emotional energy to push you further to get more done.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/session-unboxing-your-dreams-for-more-energy-tickets-20678886105\">RSVP Now<\/a><\/p> <p>Fully unboxed dreams turn up the temperature in your life.

From safaris to rugged overland trips, the continent has a lot of connotations for travelers, from beginner to expert. If you're nervous about pulling out the stops and traveling to Africa, join HI-Boston for a special, comprehensive workshop on how you can solo backpack through eastern and southern Africa. Our presenter, HI-Boston's own Paul Kuhne, traveled through Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, and South Africa earlier this year, with pit stops in Botswana and Zimbabwe, over the course of seven weeks. He'll dispel myths and misconceptions about African travel, and provide practiced tips and tricks to ensure a safe and fun journey. From safety to budgeting, Paul will walk you through his own process of planning a solo trip, and show you why you should keep Africa in your future travel plans.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms. It won't be long before we're on the road to great deeds, so you won't want to miss this great opportunity to get to know your fellow heroes!<\/p> <p>Please private message Timm with any questions regarding DMing, the event, or anything else RPG related!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-DND\/events\/227743350\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":12600000,"name":"Brooklyn Strategist Presents: D&D Encounters, Rage of Demons","id":"vfvfklyvcbrb","time":1452729600000,"updated":1452743230000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035337848000,"name":"The NYC Dungeons & Dragons Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":47098,"urlname":"NYC-DND","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"D&D Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07450","country":"us","city":"Ridgewood","address_1":"125 North Maple Avenue","name":"Ridgewood Public Library","lon":-74.110863,"id":14202622,"state":"NJ","lat":40.981197,"repinned":false},"headcount":70,"distance":17.2122173309,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450332029000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.80000019073},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello!

You will never forget, get plenty of practice, and you can catch up easily in case u missed a class. This will make you grow as a dancer much faster. This Beginner class will progress along through 12 weeks. When that is over, another 12 week period will begin. You do not pay for all 12 weeks together. You pay when u take a class and only for that class. The idea is for you guys to have the convenient choice of learn to dance salsa on wednesday and then go to dance and practice your new moves on Fridays at La fama with dancers that are at same level. Also, since I will be at La Fama, I will be open to answer questions. Those who missed a wednesday class can catch up on Friday with the help of your fellow students.<\/p> <p>The class fee will be $15 and the class duration will be 1 hour and a half. To put this in perspective for those who aren't aware, a typical salsa class will cost you $20 for 1 hour. As of right now, classes will be on Wednesdays from 7:30pm to 9pm in Pearl Studios, which is located between 35th and 36th and 8 avenue in Manhattan.<\/p> <p>Here is a preview tentative syllabus for the first 6 weeks out of the 12:<\/p> <p>During each week, the following concepts will be taught along with the material when necessary:<\/p> <p>(Posture) (Weight Shifting) (hand rotation) (spotting) (pacing) (balance) (distance control) (musicality) (etc)<\/p> <p><b>Week 1 (Jan 13th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Basic Step, Basic variations, upper body movement, Body isolations and coordination exercises, Timing, Music<\/p> <p>Partnerwork: Open Hold, Close Hold, Hand placements, Correct Frame, Correct Tension<\/p> <p><b>Week 2 (Jan 20th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Previous class review, Right-Turn<\/p> <p>Partnerwork: Previous class review, Leading The right-turn, Following the right-turn<\/p> <p><b>Week 3 (Jan 27th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Previous class review, Left-Turn<\/p> <p>Partnerwork: Previous class review, Cross-Body-Lead and Follow.<\/p> <p><b>Week 4 (Feb 3rd)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Previous class review, Shine 1 and 2 (Footwork variations)<\/p> <p>Partner-work: Previous class review, Cross-body-Lead combined with Inside Turn, Turn Combinations<\/p> <p><b>Week 5 (Feb 10th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Previous class review, Shine 3 and 4 (Footwork variations)<\/p> <p>Partner-work: Previous class review, Open-Break Step<\/p> <p><b>Week 6 (Feb 17th)<\/b><\/p> <p>Footwork: Previous class review, Shine 5 and 6 (Footwork variations)<\/p> <p>Partner-work: Previous class review, Walk-Around Turn<\/p> <p>Let me explain how this came about. The free classes I normally offer at salsa socials and lounges always teach the basic step and a single turn due to the fact that there are always new people who have never done salsa before. So if you attend every week, you will always get the same material. Those classes are meant to warm up the party and allow people to interact and be introduced to the dance. I do my best to be very detailed and give you the best instruction and it makes me happy when almost everyone in every class learns the basics in just 1 hour. This has motivated people to want to learn more and I usually get 3\/5 requests for formal classes every week.

Sinne\u2019s distinctive vocals have earned her a loyal and ever growing fan base around the world as well as in her native country. As a singer she is influenced by Nancy Wilson, Betty Carter and Sarah Vaughan, but with her personal touch of soft darkness, Sinne keeps the Scandinavian melancholy settled in her music.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Eeg has an amazing technique, coverage for all the tones she sings, a genuine jazz feeeling and an unusually large vocal range from top to bottom. Coupled with a totally obvious stage charisma, dignity and a sparkle in the eye, this really makes you surrender.\"(Review of Sinne Eeg + trio at Kristianstad Jazzfestival 10 Oct 2008 by Alexander Agrell, jazz journalist at Sydsvenskan (leading morning paper of South Sweden)<\/p> <p>\n\nAs ususal the Kitano is a $15 cover and a $20 minimum.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-jazz\/events\/227422139\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"SINNE EEG QUARTET- Special Kitano show!","id":"227422139","time":1452738600000,"updated":1452750831000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1159895494000,"name":"The NYC Jazz Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":336841,"urlname":"nyc-jazz","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Jazz Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1626 Broadway","name":"Carolines on Broadway","lon":-73.984009,"id":11888902,"state":"NY","lat":40.761059,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.82754522562,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452164761000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The most famous comedy club in the world hosts an affordable mid-week night of standup with legends popping in regularly.

We will talk about dating, sex, desire, and orgasm (not climax but orgasm - we will explain more at the meet- up). We will have some tea or coffee, eat some scones, and have a lively discussion involving things women don't normally talk about. We will have fun, laugh and have conversation with more depth than normally available in day to day life. You will also have the opportunity to learn about Orgasmic Meditation, a simple yet profound 15-minute wellness practice that creates deep and everlasting change in mind, body, and spirit. It's the central practice that we teach and it has touched each of us so deeply that we desire to share with as many others as possible.

But the most potent innovation is not the currency itself. Rather, it\u2019s the technology that undergirds bitcoin, the distributed-ledger technology known as the blockchain that allows payments to flow through an economy in an entirely decentralized way\u2014without banks or other intermediaries. This infant technology could change the financial system; think the Internet before browsers. It could reduce the cost and increase in the speed and accuracy of financial transactions; it could truly disrupt the banking business. Or it could fizzle. But already it is raising a host of policy questions \u2013 about financial stability, consumer protection, choking off terrorists' finances, and tensions between established and upstart financial institutions and between regulatory agencies.<\/p> <p>On January 14, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will explore the future of distributed ledger technology, paying special attention to the innovation\u2019s impact on financial services and policymaking. Hutchins Center director David Wessel will convene leading industry and policy experts for a panel discussion. After the session, panelists will take audience questions.<\/p> <p>You can join the conversation and tweet questions for the panelists at\u00a0#BeyondBitcoin.<\/p> <p><b>To Register for this remarkable event you must click\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/connect.brookings.edu\/register-to-watch-beyond-bitcoin\">HERE<\/a>.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Personal Note:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in this event with such an elite\u00a0institution\u00a0and distinguished panel.

This will be the first such museum exhibition in the United States in nearly half a century.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Over the course of his long career, Picasso devoted himself to sculpture wholeheartedly, if episodically, using both traditional and unconventional materials and techniques. Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status for Picasso. He approached the medium with the freedom of a self-taught artist, ready to break all the rules. This attitude led him to develop a deep fondness for his sculptures, to which the many photographs of his studios and homes bear witness. Treating them almost as members of his household, he cherished the sculptures' company and enjoyed re-creating them in a variety of materials and situations. Picasso kept the majority in his private possession during his lifetime. It was only in 1966, through the large Paris retrospective Hommage \u00e0 Picasso, that the public became fully aware of this side of his work. Following that exhibition, in 1967 The Museum of Modern Art organized The Sculpture of Picasso, which until now was the first and only exhibition on this continent to display a large number of the artist\u2019s sculptures.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Picasso Sculpture focuses on the artist\u2019s lifelong work with sculpture, with a particular focus on his use of materials and processes. The exhibition, which features more than 100 sculptures, complemented by selected works on paper and photographs, aims to advance the understanding of what sculpture was for Picasso, and of how he revolutionized its history through a lifelong commitment to constant reinvention. The exhibition is organized in chapters corresponding to the distinct periods during which Picasso devoted himself to sculpture, each time exploring with fresh intensity the modern possibilities of this ancient art form.<\/i><\/p> <p>Taken from the MoMA website<\/p> <p>Event description: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/events\/24899\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/events\/24899\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/events\/24899<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Exhibition description: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1559\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1559\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1559<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/American-Sign-Language-League-of-Nassau\/events\/224799464\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"MoMA: Picasso Sculpture","id":"224799464","time":1452810600000,"updated":1452818614000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1399129219000,"name":"American Sign Language League of Nassau and Queens","group_lon":-73.6200027466,"id":14245302,"urlname":"American-Sign-Language-League-of-Nassau","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Signers' Delight"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":22.7179489136,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441139752000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The adventure continues.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Edison-Dungeons-Dragons-Meetup\/events\/227716844\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":14400000,"name":"The As Yet Unnamed Campaign of Increasingly Poor Decisions","id":"mxtkklyvcbsb","time":1452812400000,"updated":1452828532000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Edison Dungeons & Dragons Meetup","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"Edison-Dungeons-Dragons-Meetup","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07033","country":"us","city":"Kenilworth","address_1":"14 Michigan Avenue","name":"Wildpig Comics","lon":-74.286171,"id":16236662,"state":"NJ","lat":40.676754,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3489341736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450127264000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(This session is currently capped at 8 players with all spots filled.

On the blog tour each week you will have a chance to win a one-year ATA membership as well as a free submission to Tapestry Unlimited, ATA's 11th international, unjuried, small format exhibition open to both new and seasoned weavers.

Soft instruction of both knitting and weaving for beginners will be offered by Janna. So, if you're a newbie Janna will be happy to introduce you to the basics or make you more comfortable with what you already know.<\/p> <p><br\/>Instruction here is really laid back and not structured like an actual class. \u00a0For knitting Janna teaches long-tail cast on and basic knitting and purling stitches for beginner projects like fingerless mitts or a garter stitch scarf. \u00a0If you're coming with a table-top loom I can show you how to get started or troubleshoot any issues you're facing in a project.<\/p> <p>if you're interested learning how to weave at this meetup you can buy a weaving kit at the link below and I will bring it to the meetup. You must purchase it before December 10th so I have time to shop for and make the loom.<br\/>&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everleatextiles.com\/store\/p45\/PVC_Loom_and_yarn_for_Meetup.com.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.everleatextiles.com\/store\/p45\/PVC_Loom_and_yarn_for_Meetup.com.html<\/a><\/p> <p>or make a loom for yourself as per here:<br\/>&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vancouveryarn.com\/make-a-pvc-tapestry-loom.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.vancouveryarn.com\/make-a-pvc-tapestry-loom.html<\/a><\/p> <p>If you're coming your own loom please bring your own weft yarn to weave with.

As a result, we can deliver powerful systems that self-heal and flex under load, but face a new challenge. How do we know our application is working as expected? Why Reactive Monitoring of course!<\/p> <p><br\/>In this session, we will cover the principles behind Reactive theory and discuss how Reactive Monitoring provides the insight needed for a healthy Reactive application.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Duncan<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/7\/f\/600_444299263.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Duncan DeVore is co-author of \"Reactive Application Development\", Senior Software Engineer on the Monitoring team at Typesafe, open source developer and frequent speaker. He has been an avid Scala developer since 2009, holds two patents for software design and led the release of one of the first large-scale Reactive applications in 2012.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Distributed Real-Time Stream Processing: Why and How with Petr Zapletal\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>In this talk you will discover various state of the art open-source distributed streaming frameworks, their similarities and differences, implementation trade-offs, their intended use-cases and how to choose between them. Petr will focus on the popular frameworks including Spark Streaming, Storm, Samza and Flink. In addition, you will also explore theoretical introduction, common pitfalls, popular architectures and many more.\u00a0The demand for stream processing is increasing. Immense amounts of data has to be processed fast from a rapidly growing set of disparate data sources. This pushes the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include trading, social networks, Internet of things or system monitoring, are becoming more and more important. A number of powerful, easy-to-use open source platforms have emerged to address this.\u00a0Petr's goal is to provide comprehensive overview about modern streaming solutions and to help fellow developers with picking the best possible decision for their particular use-case. Join this talk if you are thinking about, implementing or have already deployed streaming solution.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Petr<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/7\/c\/c\/600_444299340.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Petr is a Software Engineer who specialises in the design and implementation of highly scaleable, reactive and resilient distributed systems.

In the nearby village of Lyalintsi, Magister Illian Antonov is about to discover his daughter is missing. Another young girl from his community is gone, and he must face his people with no more answers than before. The darkness of the forest is closing in on the village, and the night is full of horrors. The province of Magrevia is a land of dark shadows and deep forests. A century before, the Empire of Thyatis sent its troops, intent on adding the region to its dominion. Today, the Thyatians stay within their outposts, still unable to penetrate the wild lands that surround them. The Magrevian people continue to dwell in the communities that have sheltered them for generations, their doors and windows closed tight each night against the darkness.

Let's get together\u00a0every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations. And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together\u00a0sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=224+West+4th+street%2C+New+York%2C+NY%2C+10014%2C+us","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/fat-cat-fab-lab\/events\/227628950\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":9000000,"name":"3D Thursdays!","id":"kggzmlyvcbsb","time":1452816000000,"updated":1452826926000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364936758000,"name":"fat cat FAB LAB","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":7890972,"urlname":"fat-cat-fab-lab","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"makers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Tarrytown","address_1":"460 South Broadway in Tarrytown just south of the Tappen Zee Bridge entrance   Look on left for diner.

He is a graduate of Loyola College (now University) in Maryland and University of Baltimore School of Law.<\/p> <p>Discovering that the teaching of the law in America had been perverted away from its original design, Michael determined to investigate America\u2019s founding and the roots of our law, in English Common Law and the Bible. This led to the founding of Institute on the Constitution, which is an educational outreach of the law firm of Peroutka and Peroutka, also in Pasadena, Maryland. IOTC presents the real view -- the founders\u2019 view -- which is the <i>American<\/i> view of law and government.<\/p> <p>The Constitution Party\u2019s candidate for President in 2004, Michael had a platform which sought to honor God, protect the family, and restore the Republic. The platform came to be known as \u201cThe American View of Law and Government,\u201d and inspired the name of his website, <b>TheAmericanView.com<\/b>. IOTC teaches that American view:<\/p> <p>There is a God, the God of the Bible.<\/p> <p>Our rights come from Him.<\/p> <p>The purpose of civil government is to secure our God-given rights.<\/p> <p>Michael Peroutka has traveled around the country, graduating classes from IOTC\u2019s course on the United States Constitution, in addition to teaching classes in IOTC\u2019s Pasadena, Maryland classroom. Under his instruction, those who take the course become very familiar with the words, meaning and purpose of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Biblical principles on which those founding documents are based. IOTC teaches the only known course on the Maryland Constitution, and a course on the lawful duty and role of the Jury.<\/p> <p>______________________________________<\/p> <p>Please join the Christian Party of America\u2019s monthly Town Hall Conference Call to discuss current political issues with like-minded Christians. The Town Hall conference call is the second Thursday of each month at\u00a08:30 PM est. (7:30 PM central). Don Watson, National Vice-Chairman and North Carolina State Chairman will lead the discussion on what can be done to address the concerns we all share for the status of our country\u2019s civil government. Luis Chiang, National Advisory Board Member and Director of the Prayer Team, will lead us in prayer to close the call. Guest speakers will be present at some of the calls to provide input on political issues.<\/p> <p>The Christian Party of America\u2019s nationwide Conference Calls are a great opportunity to connect with other Christian Party supporters as we try to make a difference in this country. So sign on with us for the conference call to discuss issues and contribute your thoughts about what we can be doing politically. Our Town Hall conference calls are open to the public and are for all of us who are interested in the Christian Party of America. It is an easy-access way to share ideas and learn more about what is going on around the country with the Christian Party of America.

There are plenty of other winter activities for non-skiers or for folks that wish to mix things up - go snowshoeing in the Adirondacks, snow tubing at the Olympic Jump Complex and\/or ice skating or tobogganing at Mirror Lake.<\/p> <p>For registration instructions and additional details about the trip, please visit us here: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YwgLjw\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YwgLjw<\/a><\/p> <p>To view photos of downtown Lake Placid, Whiteface Mountain and the lodge, please visit us here:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/on.fb.me\/1SmKGHj\"><a href=\"http:\/\/on.fb.me\/1SmKGHj\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/on.fb.me\/1SmKGHj<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>For additional information on Whiteface Mountain and Lake Placid, visit here: <a href=\"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1Xjtau7\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1Xjtau7\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1Xjtau7<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AMCYoungMembers\/events\/227036382\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":277200000,"name":"Young Members - MLK Ski Weekend at Whiteface Mountain","id":"227036382","time":1452877200000,"updated":1453439661000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1224562109000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club - Young Members","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1305506,"urlname":"AMCYoungMembers","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Young Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10030","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"2303 Adam Clayton Powell Jr Blvd","name":"Rosicrucian Cultural Center of New York City","lon":-73.943253,"id":12250252,"state":"NY","lat":40.815384,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.1474442482,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1365016911000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/5\/a\/event_217333402.jpegJoin\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/5\/a\/event_217333402.jpegJoin<\/a> us Monday through Friday at 12 pm, to send thoughts of Light, Life and Love to all of humanity and to our magnificent planet Earth!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please arrive by 12 noon as the doors will be locked between 12:00 and 12:20 while we are meditating.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Everyone is welcome!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/227942471\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Send Thoughts of Light, Life and Love throughout the World!","id":"qtcxrfyvcbtb","time":1452877200000,"updated":1452889399000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Mystics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"long branch","address_1":"one ocean blvd","name":"ocean place","lon":0,"id":20734322,"state":"NJ","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":124,"headcount":0,"distance":11.0859470367,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423758770000,"fee":{"amount":100,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"DEPOSIT","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":18,"average":4.94000005722},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ALL INCLUSIVE My Favorite Things Crop<\/p> <p>January 15-17th<\/p> <p>You will not want to miss this BIG EVENT!<\/p> <p>Ocean Place Resort<\/p> <p>One Ocean Blvd<\/p> <p>Long Branch NJ 07740<\/p> <p>Please note the sleeping rooms are 2\u00a0queen beds per room.<\/p> <p><b><i>This is a resort you will have full access to:<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>In room bottled water, coffe, tea, use of the fitness center, indoor and outdoor pools, activities desk, free parking, in room local and toll free calls, wireless internet, business center, luggage handling and shuttle service if you need to train it.<\/i><\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit of $100.00 needs to be made at time of booking via paypal.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>What is MFT?<\/b><\/p> <p>Croppers Delight is bringing back our \"Oprah take\" on our first Favorite things!

And we know your time is valuable. Most of all, we know that ski trips are all about getting away from it all and having fun. We believe Mount Snow encompasses everything a great ski vacation is made of. Here\u2019s why.<\/p> <p>The Bluebird Express<br\/>Mount Snow is the only place in North America where you will find a high speed detachable six passenger bubble lift. We call it the Bluebird Express, for short. This $8.5 million technologically advanced chairlift was brand new for the 2011\/2012 season and it is nothing short of incredible. The bubbles on each chair can be lowered by the passengers to provide similar protection as a gondola cabin, but with the convenience of keeping skis and boards on their feet. The seven minute ride from base to summit is so smooth the only reason you would want it to end is so you can enjoy another amazing run down one of Mount Snow\u2019s 80 trails.

It was at this moment that Skanska chose to involve itself with the vivisection industry and to profit from the imprisonment and torture of endless generations of animals by literally burying them underground. They were eagerly prepared to make millions. What they were not prepared for was the animal liberation movement.<\/p> <p><br\/>The No New Animal Lab campaign was our response. We began organizing to stop them. We planned to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/stormskanska\">#StormSkanska<\/a>. Dozens of actions against Skanska have spanned dozens of cities -- from handing out leaflets to shutting down their construction site through direct action. The pressure has always been escalating and intensifying.

Subtopics include the difference between the Product Backlog vs. the Sprint Backlog, how to break PBIs into Sprint Tasks, timeboxing, what is a \"potentially shippable product increment\", definition of done, planning for testing within a Sprint, limiting Work In Progress (WIP), team volunteerism, and commitment-based planning.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>4- Daily Scrum Meeting<\/b><br\/>This module covers the second and most frequent meeting in the Scrum cycle. Subtopics include effective use of the taskboard, team self-organization, how to incorporate varying skills on one team, the Scrum Master role during Sprint Execution, pros and cons of involving the Product Owner each day, the three questions, and keeping the meeting short.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>5- Sprint Review\/Demo Meeting<\/b><br\/>This module covers the meeting held after the execution of each Sprint in which the team conducts a live demonstration of the working product increment for the Product Owner. For those outside the team, this is the most visible part of Scrum. Subtopics include: Acceptance criteria and definition of done, velocity, transparency, how to involve external stakeholders, and emergent requirements in the Product Backlog.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>6- Sprint Retrospective Meeting<\/b><br\/>This module covers the final meeting associated with each Sprint. In this meeting, the team reflects on the Sprint to raise its own awareness of what transpired. It ends with agreements about specific adaptations for future Sprints.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Frequently asked questions:<\/b><\/p> <p>What\u2019s difficulty level are we talking about here?\u00a0<\/p> <p>The Scrum Master Certificate (SMC) is a 1-day course that\u2019s been developed for professionals with little to no experience in product management. Can I expense this for my company or write it off for my business?<br\/>Yes, and we can help you prepare any additional documentation that your employer may need.<\/p> <p>What\u2019s included in the price?\u00a0<\/p> <p>The price includes access to the class, the Scrum Master Certificate (SMC) and lifetime access to our <a href=\"https:\/\/productschool.perkhub.com\/\">perks platform<\/a><\/p> <p>How can I obtain the Scrum Master Certificate (SMC)?\u00a0<\/p> <p>Upon completion of the class, and an 80\/100 score or higher on the assessment test, you'll earn the Scrum Master Certificate (SMC).

Through the artists\u2019 vision we are able to view the unseen.

All barbecue is cooked fresh daily on premise in our custom meat-smoking room. Our brisket, sausage, ribs and other meats are smoked low and slow over Texas post oak and are served on butcher paper, counter-style by the pound as is traditional in Central Texas.. Updated versions of classic Southern sides and sweets, created by executive chef Elizabeth Karmel, include Longhorn Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese and Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Cupcakes. Hill Country features a marketplace full of Lone Star State favorites such as Kreuz Market sausage, Big Red soda, and Blue Bell ice cream.

When we call a person\u2019s name we evoke his entire personality. Each person sees us differently according to his soul content. We may say that we see ourselves in the eyes of others. We may also say that the Divine sees us through the eyes of others. When a group of people chants our name collectively, a profound phenomenon of healing occurs. In this workshop we learn to create a group field and once created we use it to heal each other in an ancient ceremony invoking the holiness of one\u2019s name. One by one people take turns in having their name chanted by the group while being in the center of a circle of friends for about 4-5 minutes each. We share the content of the individual experience with each other. Very powerful.About\u00a0Anton BaraschiAnton Baraschi is a bioenergy specialist, teaching and practicing bioenergy healing (aka medical qigong) in Manhattan, with a focus on integrating multiple bioenergy healing modalities in supporting the work of medical professionals. Bioenergy healing stimulates a person\u2019s own immune system with emphasis on the condition diagnosed by the doctor.

Three years is a long time to keep anything going, much less a boozy NYC meetup!

Spirit Education Trust, the most feared unit is Unit 3\u2014innocuously called Light Wines.\u00a0 This unit covers all the wines of the world that are neither sparkling nor fortified, and it concludes with a two-part exam, essays and blind tasting.\u00a0 It\u2019s daunting to try to study for this test, since it covers such an immense range of material.\u00a0 The first time I took the Unit 3 exam, I passed blind tasting with merit, but fell short in the essay part.\u00a0 I needed to retake it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In the essay exam, there is one compulsory question, then you are given a choice of six topics from which you choose four to write essays on.\u00a0 The second time I took the essay exam, I was torn between two topics\u2014Puglia (the heel of Italy\u2019s boot), and a comparison of M\u00e2con and Beaujolais.\u00a0 Given that I\u2019m a rabid Francophile, the latter topic was surely the natural choice for me.\u00a0 But no, I took a shot at Puglia.\u00a0 I passed the exam overall, but failed the Puglia question.\u00a0 This has haunted me ever since.\u00a0 <i>Why didn\u2019t I write about M\u00e2con and Beaujolais?<\/i>\u00a0 <i>I could have nailed it!<\/i>\u00a0 So, better late than never, I\u2019ll do it now.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Often overlooked in favor of the more prestigious C\u00f4te d\u2019Or to the north, M\u00e2con and Beaujolais are Burgundy\u2019s southernmost areas.\u00a0 (Although the wines of Beaujolais are so distinctive that it is often considered its own region, entirely separate from Burgundy.)\u00a0 Both are prolific regions that can offer excellent value in French wine, especially if one is looking for pure, ripe expressions of Chardonnay fruit.<\/p> <p>Unlike the densely planted strip of vineyards that make up the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, vineyards in the M\u00e2connais region are spread out over rolling hillsides, interspersed with other forms of agriculture.\u00a0 But as in the Cote d\u2019Or, the soils are limestone-based and favorable to Chardonnay.\u00a0 Ninety percent of M\u00e2connais wine is white, made in quantities that are three times greater than the white-wine production of the rest of Burgundy combined.\u00a0 \u00a0M\u00e2con enjoys warmer, drier weather than the Cote d\u2019Or, and the Chardonnay fruit ripens earlier.\u00a0 Much of the production is unoaked, and offers refreshing bright fruit and minerality.\u00a0 When people tell me they don\u2019t like Chardonnay, I assume they have in mind heavy-handed California oak bombs and often suggest they try a M\u00e2con.\u00a0<\/p> <p>One step up from the basic M\u00e2con appellation is M\u00e2con-Villages, in which names of particular villages with favorable vineyard sites can be appended to the appellation name.\u00a0 Other M\u00e2con appellations include St-V\u00e9ran, in the southern end of the M\u00e2connais, where the wines have stone fruit and floral notes with flinty minerality.\u00a0 The most famous M\u00e2con appellation is Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9, also in the southern M\u00e2connais, in the shadow of the Solutr\u00e9 and Vergisson crags, which mark the end of Burgundy\u2019s limestone ridge.\u00a0 Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 enjoyed a faddish popularity back in the \u201870s (no, I wasn\u2019t drinking back then), then fell into disfavor in subsequent decades (possibly from overproduction, rising prices, and a decline in quality).\u00a0 But there are outstanding examples of Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9\u2014full bodied with a good balance of acid, fruit, and mineral, with some well-applied oak.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Small amounts of red M\u00e2con are made, from Pinot Noir and (more commonly now) Gamay.\u00a0 These can be hard to find but are worth seeking out.\u00a0 The examples I\u2019ve tried have had a nice peppery quality along with that bright Gamay fruit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be trying three M\u00e2con Chardonnays from three different vintages, which will give us an idea of how well these wines age:\u00a0 from 2009, a <i>Villages<\/i> wine from M\u00e2con-Cruzeille; an old-vines Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 from 2011; and another old-vines Chardonnay from prestige producer Thevenet in St-V\u00e9ran.\u00a0 Plus a 2014 M\u00e2con Rouge from M\u00e2con-Serri\u00e8res, considered the best appellation for M\u00e2con Gamay.<\/p> <p>Just south of M\u00e2con is the Beaujolais region, where Burgundian limestone gives way to granite soils, favorable to the Gamay grape.\u00a0 Beaujolais is synonymous with easy-drinking, low-tannin, fruity reds, meant to be drunk young.\u00a0 Much is produced through the carbonic maceration method, in which whole, uncrushed grapes are sealed in a tank with CO2, promoting spontaneous fermentation of a brightly fruity, low-tannin wine.\u00a0 The best Beaujolais comes from the ten <i>cru<\/i> appellations in the granite hills of northern Beaujolais, where increasingly serious winemaking is taking place.\u00a0 Cru Beaujolais is vinified with traditional maceration and pressing, often followed by cask aging.\u00a0 The best examples are ageworthy wines that can compete with Burgundy Pinot Noirs.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Small amounts of Chardonnay-based Beaujolais Blanc are made, in the northern part of the region that practically overlaps with M\u00e2con and shares its limestone soil.<\/p> <p>We will be trying two <i>cru<\/i> Beaujolais from Morgon and Fleurie, both made by up-and-coming women winemakers.\u00a0 Plus a Beaujolais Blanc made by noted winemaker Jean-Paul Brun, using indigenous yeast and low sulfites.<\/p> <p>For a tasting featuring fruit-forward whites and low-tannin reds, I thought it would be a good time to try matching wine with Chinese food.\u00a0 Many thanks to wine-dinner regular Philip for making the arrangements at Land of Plenty on East 58th Street (just down the block from the Townhouse bar).\u00a0 The fee for this dinner reflects a $50 corkage charge for the table ($5 per person).\u00a0 Philip has arranged with the restaurant for us to have a prix-fixe menu to be shared family-style around a round table.\u00a0 Vegetarians will be accommodated, but there will also be pork, beef, lamb, chicken, fish, and shrimp, at a variety of spice levels.\u00a0 Cost of food will be $30 per person<i>, including tax and tip.<\/i>\u00a0 <i>PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0 The restaurant would like us to pay in cash. <\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.landofplenty58.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.landofplenty58.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.landofplenty58.com\/<\/a>#<\/a>!<\/p> <p>So maybe the next theme should be Puglia . . .<\/p> <p><b>2009 Domaine Guillot-Broux M\u00e2con-Cruzille Les Perri\u00e8res\u00a0 $33<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.\u00a0 From the winemaker:<\/i> \u201cThe soil of the Perri\u00e8res is difficult to work and very fragile. The vineyard was abandoned after the phylloxera epidemic for these very reasons. However, the wine produced is wonderfully lively and very mineral. It needs at least two or three years after being bottled to start hinting at its true colours.\u00a0 Since 2001, the wine has been aged for 18 months in second or third generation oak barrels without either fining or filtering.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2011 Olivier Merlin Pouilly Fuiss\u00e9 Clos des Quarts\u00a0 $45<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 94<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 Clos des Quarts is from the Chartre part of the vineyard immediately above Pouilly-Vinzelles populated by many vines planted way back in 1917. It reveals hints of white truffle and marzipan on the beautifully defined nose that blossoms with aeration. The palate is elegant and refined; not powerful but exuding finesse with hints of white peach and honeycomb on the long finish. Outstanding.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Domaine Thevenet St-V\u00e9ran Clos de l\u2019Ermitage Vieilles Vignes\u00a0 $15<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.\u00a0 From the importer:<\/i> \u201cThis \u2018prestige\u2019 cuv\u00e9e is produced from the oldest vines in a five-hectare parcel exploited entirely as a \u2018monopole\u2019 by the Thevenet family.\u00a0 The average age of the south-facing Chardonnay vines located in Priss\u00e9 are seventy years old.\u00a0 This highly concentrated wine of limited production (about 12,000 bottles per year are produced) is aged in cuve (no oak aging).\u00a0 It displays a powerful constitution with great density; it is marked also by notes of tilleul and jasmine in the bouquet and hints of pear in its flavor.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2013 Jean-Paul Brun Beaujolais Blanc Terres Dor\u00e9es\u00a0 $21<\/b><\/p> <p><i>View from the Cellar 89<\/i> \u2013 \u201cJean-Paul Brun\u2019s 2013 Beaujolais Blanc is a very pretty example of the vintage and a fine bottle of Chardonnay, as it offers up a soil-driven nose of apple, peach, gentle leesy tones, a lovely base of stony soil, white flowers and a bit of citrus peel. On the palate the wine is deep, full-bodied and complex, with a good core, sound acids, very good focus and balance and a long, classy finish. This is every bit as satisfying as many a top M\u00e2con and sells for far less, making it a lovely value.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>2013 Domaine Mee Godard Morgon Grand Cras\u00a0 $30<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated.<\/i>\u00a0 100% Gamay on southeast colluvium-soil slopes. Vine density of 4,500-5,000 vines\/acre, gobelet pruning and an average age of 40 years. Hand-worked viticulture and harvested in small crates. Each parcel was vinified in a concrete tank and aged separately. Winemaking lasted 18 days. Aged in barrels and demi-muids for 11.5 months and in a tank for two and a half months. 2,000 bottles.<\/p> <p><b>2013 Anne Sophie Dubois Fleurie l\u2019Alchimiste\u00a0 $20<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 The 2013 Fleurie l'Alchimiste was picked by hand, fermented with native yeast, de-stemmed and underwent a three-week cuvaison before aging half in cement and half in barrel for 13 months. There is a purity and playfulness on the nose that is very attractive, offering buoyant red cherries and raspberry fruit. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe red cherry and strawberry fruit and fine precision on the finish. Excellent!\u00a0 What can be more pleasurable than a fresh, crisp Fleurie, maybe slightly cooled and allowed to warm in your glass. Not much, especially when it comes from talented Anne-Sophie Dubois. She just has the right approach to winemaking \u2013 adhering to traditional methods of vinification and allowing her Fleurie to \"sing.\" I tasted two recent releases from Anne-Sophie and, like previous wines, they are a) difficult to pronounce and b) absolutely delicious.<\/p> <p><b>2014 Ch\u00e2teau de La Greffi\u00e8re M\u00e2con-Serri\u00e8res Rouge\u00a0 $15<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Not rated. From the winemaker:<\/i> Maceration of eight days and then gentle pressing, bottling after malolactic fermentation. Rich purple color; aromas of red fruits; structured wine, light, soft and round. Serri\u00e8res is reputed to be one of the best towns for producing red M\u00e2con.\u00a0 100% Gamay.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Cash event\u2014please bring $30 for the prix-fixe menu.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group\/events\/227826141\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"M\u00e2con and Beaujolais","id":"227826141","time":1452902400000,"updated":1453003265000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432265288000,"name":"NYC Gay Men's Wine Dinner Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18616490,"urlname":"NYC-Gay-Mens-Wine-Dinner-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Long Island City","address_1":"36-01 36th Ave","name":"The Uke Hut","lon":-73.92337,"id":23236622,"state":"NY","lat":40.753601,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.50341057777,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430589760000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and hang and jam at the uke hut<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUkuleleJam\/events\/227814286\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Hang and jam at the Uke Hut","id":"rzhvglyvcbtb","time":1452902400000,"updated":1452914120000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1160770563000,"name":"The New York City Ukulele Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":344133,"urlname":"NYCUkuleleJam","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Ukulele Players\/Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"153 East 53rd Street","name":"Atrium at Citigroup Center ","lon":-73.970444,"id":4611332,"state":"NY","lat":40.758438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.18020117283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434143344000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u30fc NEW MEMBERS ARE WELCOME \u30fc<\/p> <p><b>What is J-Kuru?<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>These evening events are for those who want to learn Japanese \u00a0&amp; \"\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u305f\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\" \u3002\u00a0Beginner intermediate, and advanced levels are all welcome!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/b\/8\/600_398215992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Practice &amp; improve your Japanese\/English in a fun, casual environment--and make a few friends along the way!

This is our monthly Happiness and Goodness Happy Hour Meetup.\u00a0 According to the research, alcohol, when consumed responsibly, can be a great mood enhancer!<\/p> <p><br\/>Drink specials are from 4pm until 8pm, and we'll begin our meetings at 7pm. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p><br\/>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change\u00a0<\/a><br\/>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a>\u00a0<br\/>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a>\u00a0<br\/>By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for our red Meetup sign!
