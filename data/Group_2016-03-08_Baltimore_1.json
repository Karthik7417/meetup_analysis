We check out a lot of movies at the AFI Silver Theater.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although we\u2019re based in Silver Spring and are head-over-heels for the AFI, we are open to seeing films at the Regal Majestic 20 in Silver Spring, one of the independent theaters in DC, and even outdoor screenings during the warmer months.&nbsp;<span>Just let us know what screenings you are interested in. We don\u2019t discriminate. (Except against snakes. Snakes are not invited, and their opinions are unwelcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Come see a movie with us, and join us afterwards to chat about it. We may have some food or drinks and a heated yet friendly discussion after the movie.<\/p>\n<p><br><b>How It Works<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We have meetups at least twice a month, so check back often. Chances are, we will be seeing one of your favorite movies, or one you\u2019ve always been meaning to see. Occasionally, we\u2019ll see a movie that none of your friends would be willing to see.&nbsp;After you RSVP for the event, you can buy your tickets either online on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afi.com\/silver\/\">AFI&nbsp; Silver's website<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.afi.com\/silver\/\"><\/a>, or at the AFI box office. Before the movie we gather as a group, at the AFI Cafe inside the lobby, so newcomers can meet everyone and old friends can chat. <br> <br><b>RSVPing\/No-Shows<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>A brief word about RSVPing for an event- If you RSVPed, and discover that you can't make it to the meetup\u2026. No problem!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But PLEASE change your RSVP to \"no\" so we as organizers are not waiting for you to show up to the theater. (The AFI staff is tired of seeing us crying and playing the Charlie Brown Theme in the lobby.)<\/p>\n<p>If this becomes an issue repeat offenders may be removed from the group. (Also, it will go on your permanent record.)<\/p>\n<p>And please don't show up to the meetup without RSVPing. We want to be able to find each other at the theater!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><b>About the Organizers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Pete, Nate, and Airrion are three regular gentlemen (we use this term loosely) who share a love of movies, beer, and good-natured trash talking. They have combined forces (undecided as of yet whether for good or evil) on a podcast called Movie Nightcap during which they talk about a movie they have just watched. &nbsp;Their involvement in this group comes from their passion for the unique experience movies offer when people watch them together, have a beverage, and chat. These are the same reasons the podcast, Movie Nightcap, was created. &nbsp;If you are interested in checking out the podcast you can find it on <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/movie-nightcap\/id907240490?mt=2]iTunes[\/url\">iTunes<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/podcast\/movie-nightcap\">Stitcher<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/poddirectory.com\/podcast\/13361\/movie-nightcap\">Poddirectory<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p> <br><b>Ideas, Questions, Feedback<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to message any of the three organizers with your ideas, suggestions, and feedback. We are always happy to hear from you. As new group organizers, we are learning on the job. Thank you for your interest and your patience as this group develops.

Most sessions will be open on a first RSVP first play basis. There will be a mix of continuing campaigns and one-shot adventures with the goal to keep mixing up genres and systems as we go forward.

These will alternate between Friday, Saturday, and Sunday sessions. We always need volunteers to GM and these events are only possible when we have enough GMs to make it work. The number of RSVP spots will be determined by what the GMs decide is their optimum number of players.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>LARP<\/b>: We're going to try once every four months to run a LARP with politics, intrigue, and mystery. This will be a sci-fi fantasy setting that specific enough to frame the scenario but vague enough for you to make your character your own.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Good Enough Gaming<\/b>: These are tutorials and help sessions for people wanting to learn how to GM or merely pick up some tricks on how to improve their game.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns don't hesitate to message me!<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Q) What will be provided at the session?<\/strong> <br>A) Some sessions will have snacks provided and some dinner, they will be labelled.

We also have plenty of pens, pencils, paper, notecards, and dice.&nbsp; <br> <br><strong>Q) What should I bring?<\/strong> <br>A) A sense of fun and teamwork! No rules knowledge or prior experience is presumed. Contributions of snacks or sodas are always appreciated.

We respect each other and our differences, but maintain that the core belief of this group is based on the acceptance of Jesus Christ alone. If you are not a Christian, that is OK, just keep in mind you will be surrounded by them, and we love one another and will love you! :) This will be an environment where we can freely share the love and knowledge of Christ without judgment. It is also a place where others can learn of Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior, if they wish. In addition to our outdoors activities we can discuss the bible (a favorite topic), our faith, ask questions, share testimonies, understand and get to know our different backgrounds and strengthen each other in our walk with Christ and in our lives. The primary purpose of this group is to bring to believers in Christ together through doing things we enjoy, so talking about Jesus will be very likely and even encouraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We would love to have an active group, so if you are interested in leading an event in a particular area, <strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">please contact us<\/span><\/strong>, and we might reach out to some of you for help.

Shy, Introverts and Anxious people Welcome! Hi. I'm Rachel, started attending a support group in DC over 3yrs ago. I have social anxieties and I was becoming agoraphobia. I was self-isolating and avoiding human interactions. I've been facilitating the Support Group Meetings in DC for Social Anxieties for over 2yrs. I'm the organizer of \" DC Social Anxiety Support Group Events\" Meet Up. I live in Baltimore and I want to expand into this area. Typically we have 5-6people attending our weekly\/biweekly. Wednesday meeting. We share our experiences living with and overcoming our anxieties. Baltimore meetings will be on Wednesdays at 7:30-8:30pm. We'll start with a Casual Conversation about Social Skills. (For example making eye contact, making phone calls, giving and receiving compliments, office parties.) We'll go around and say our Names and a Personal Triumph. (For example, I went on an interview, I attended a meet up.) Then we will have an Open Discussion. We can discuss different social situations, difficulties, and challenges. We will finish the meeting with Personal Goals. (For example Connect more with friends and family). Hopefully together we will find good Solutions, Ideas, and Advice. The purpose of this meeting, so you can go through the day in a calm and smoother way, with less anxieties. This group might not be the exact answer for you, But please consider attending at least of our meet ups. This is a great place to start! Once you get the momentum rolling you will surprise yourself! We also do different fun activities around the city. Please note this is peer support only NOT Professional help. This is for people with social anxieties only, if you want to bring a friend or family member as encouraging support that's fine. STUDENTS! If you are \"required to attend a support group\" for a College Course Credit, you're can call me to discuss you LEADING one of our meeting.(I mean guiding our the conversation with me shadowing you.) I we post a notice for that Wednesday, stating, we will be having a guest facilitator. You are NOT Allowed to just come to Observe Us. (Go to AA instead, because these people are too SHY! I have a hard enough time getting them to open up and talk about their issues, without you watching them!)

Since we, as Gen X Washingtonians in our older\/wiser age, tend to be more selective about where and how we travel, this group\u2019s focus is on non-touristy, responsible travel (to local, domestic and international destinations).<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool, distinctive destinations (e.g., Iceland) with lots of character, as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community, which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains.&nbsp; Our broad definition of Gen-X means people in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, so our goal with the age preference is simply to bring together folks who are in the same general age bracket with similar high quality values and adventurous spirit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Besides our guiding principles, we go wherever we want to go! Near and far, domestic and international, beach and city, mountains and lakes, adventure and relaxation, day trips to two week getaways and everything in between. This is our travel club and it\u2019s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool, fun places and are looking for like-minded, new friends to travel with, then this is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>How do we decide where to go?&nbsp; Easy\u2026 while we\u2019ll offer some trips, and we\u2019ll chat about locales of interest at local meet-ups.&nbsp; Our local meet-ups are a fantastic way to get to know each other and the oh so many neighborhoods in and around DC.&nbsp; Always new places to check out and many neighborhoods to keep up with\u2026 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time!&nbsp; We also can do other types of quality, local DC outings (e.g., walks\/hikes, volunteering) to keep in touch, continue our travel ideas and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors. &nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>After running this meet-up group for two years, we have learned a few things we feel are important in building a high quality meet-up community.&nbsp; Namely clear membership profile pictures, answering questionnaire, and RSVPing to events only if you seriously plan to attend. Why are we now incorporating these rules?&nbsp; We are asking for clear profile pictures to help us recognize you\u2026. asking for the completed questionnaire so we can better serve the community\u2026 and asking for accurate RSVP\u2019s to help us plan accordingly, manage events and ensure fairness for outings that require an accurate head count.&nbsp; These are some easy breezy requests which will go a long way to help us create an even better meet-up group.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-77.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/e\/c\/highres_280953772.jpeg","photo_id":280953772,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/e\/c\/600_280953772.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/e\/c\/thumb_280953772.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14040381,"name":"Gail","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/highres_172801462.jpeg","photo_id":172801462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/member_172801462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/thumb_172801462.jpeg"}},"members":1538,"name":"Washington DC Gen X Travel Club (late 30s, 40s, early 50s)","id":10153202,"state":"DC","urlname":"Washington-DC-Gen-X-Travel-Club-late-30s-40s-early-50s","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":38.9300003052,"who":"Gen X'ers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Greenbelt","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378778660000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"lanparty","name":"LAN Party","id":3214},{"urlkey":"onlinegaming","name":"Online Gaming","id":10289},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"pc-gaming","name":"PC Gaming","id":24570},{"urlkey":"lan-party-tournaments","name":"LAN Party Tournaments","id":28981},{"urlkey":"computer-gaming","name":"Computer Gaming","id":28983},{"urlkey":"gaming-tournaments","name":"Gaming Tournaments","id":28984},{"urlkey":"multiplayer-gaming","name":"Multiplayer Gaming","id":29436},{"urlkey":"console-lan-party","name":"Console Lan Party","id":32769}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/marylandLANgamers\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for those interested in LAN Gaming.

We'll have events such as photo shoots, poetry reading sessions, hair care product reviews, natural hair advice seminars, and much more.","lon":-76.6299972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/5\/0\/highres_300046672.jpeg","photo_id":300046672,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/5\/0\/600_300046672.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/6\/5\/0\/thumb_300046672.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":66028142,"name":"Victoria Crawley","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/b\/9\/a\/highres_155272122.jpeg","photo_id":155272122,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/b\/9\/a\/member_155272122.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/b\/9\/a\/thumb_155272122.jpeg"}},"members":43,"name":"Naturalista's Hair Porn","id":10864722,"state":"MD","urlname":"Naturalistas-Hair-Porn","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":39.1599998474,"who":"Naturalistas"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382974526000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"upcycling","name":"upcycling","id":20384},{"urlkey":"fabric-crafts","name":"Fabric Crafts","id":21827},{"urlkey":"recycled-crafts","name":"Recycled Crafts","id":26027},{"urlkey":"handmade","name":"Handmade","id":68826}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CraftatScrapDC\/","rating":4.81,"description":"<p>In the second half of 2013, the crafty nonprofit\/thrift store&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/scrapdc.org\/\">SCRAP DC<\/a>&nbsp;moved to a new Brookland location, and a few months later, began hosting this Meetup.

Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting Girl Develop It on our mission to make software development easy, affordable and accessible to all women.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.girldevelopit.com\/donate\">Your contribution<\/a>\u00a0helps us expand our mission to create great programs and opportunities for women learning to code.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Interested in helping as a teacher, teacher assistant, sponsor or in another way?

Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, an internationally renowned author, meditation teacher, and spiritual leader.\u00a0 For more information about Sant Rajinder Singh and the tradition of Sant Mat, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sos.org\/\">www.sos.org<\/a>.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Our Group:<\/p>\n<p>The theme of the group will be meditation in the Sant Mat tradition (customarily translated as <i>The Path of the Masters<\/i>).\u00a0 I hope to create a space where everyone feels welcome and we enjoy our time together.\u00a0 Thank you to other meetup group coordinators\u00a0of Baltimore Vegetarian Group, Columbia Insight Meditation Group, and ZenAdventures for letting their members know about us.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0plan to start and end the group with short, 10-15 minutes meditation sittings.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the time at Oakland Manor will be a chance to learn more about the teachings with opportunities to ask questions or share with one another as well.<\/p>\n<p>After our meetings, we will have\u00a0opportunites to get together for dinner or other activities which may be suggested.\u00a0 Love and fellowship are our cornerstones, yet we seek to first nurture ourselves by going within via meditation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Meetings will generally be held 2nd and 4th Sundays at Hebron House in Ellicott City, Maryland.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ OUR MEETUP PAGE REGULARLY FOR OUR LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A Personal Testimony:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In early 1980, I first found out about yoga when an English Professor handed me a book.\u00a0 I had already been exposed to meditation techniques at home, because my mother and two brothers had practiced alternative methods.\u00a0 I yearned for more in my life, and I wasn't sure where to find it.\u00a0 The theory of yoga and how everything is within us struck a chord.\u00a0 I started to \"OM\" on my bed in\u00a0my dormitory room.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, when my folks found out about my search, though they were open-minded, they were also concerned.\u00a0 In truth, so was I.\u00a0\u00a0This was\u00a0years before the internet, and\u00a0I struggled to gather information about what\u00a0my spiritual options were.\u00a0 I attended Bible studies on campus, and I also enjoyed reading about Buddhist meditation practices.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After the spring semester, I returned to my folks' home, and my mother handed me a California publication called \"Common Ground\".\u00a0\u00a0 I leafed through about 30 pages and came across an interesting ad:\u00a0 \"Are you really seeking God?\u00a0 Do you expect to find Him in massages and whirlpools?\"\u00a0 Then there was a quote by Darshan Singh about the cry of the soul.\u00a0 I was amused and intrigued. I wrote to California (snail mail - no email in those days) and in return, I received a few handouts and the phone number of someone in Columbia, Maryland who coordinated the local satsang (spiritual meeting).\u00a0 I attended my first satsang, and my life's never been the same since.<\/p>\n<p>I respect\u00a0other meditation\u00a0paths, and I enjoy sitting in with other groups.\u00a0\u00a0Many\u00a0people nowadays\u00a0benefit from various meditation practices.\u00a0\u00a0To say that all\u00a0meditation paths are the same is a different story.\u00a0\u00a0Not all fitness programs are the same, not all diets offer the same results, and not all academic institutions offer the same quality of\u00a0education --\u00a0Why should we\u00a0imagine that all spiritual paths or meditation practices aim towards the same goal or are equal in their ability to conduce towards spiritual\u00a0awakening and empowerment?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sant Mat still appeals to me as offering the most comprehensive and hopeful message and the highest possible goal.\u00a0 I've discovered what many others before me have learned:\u00a0 Spiritual development involves many paradoxes.\u00a0 In order to make \"quick\" progress, we need to learn how to become \"still\".\u00a0 If we are in a \"hurry\" to experience inner peace and fulfillment, we need to development \"patience\".\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I'd never trade my good fortune in being led to this path for anything else.\u00a0 It's always felt like a great blessing to be led to a caring, competent spiritual Guide, and the price I've had to pay is commitment and opening my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Spirituality is a gift like any other gift of nature.\u00a0 In the Sant Mat tradition, programs are offered for free.\u00a0 In a country like the States, we need to put our suspicions on hold for a few moments and allow this simple thought to sink in.\u00a0 It's not easy to discover ourselves.\u00a0 Many of us arrive at the doorstep of direct spirituality and mysticism after a long and painful journey.\u00a0When we connect with the love that's already within us, healing naturally occurs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I've shared a little of my story, because I wanted to highlight how this is a personal experience for each one of us, and there's hope.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Best Wishes to everyone on your own spiritual journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Steve<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-76.8300018311,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":53820502,"name":"Steve"},"members":188,"name":"Inner Light and Sound

The overall idea of forming this group is to form a community of meditators who can do group meditations regularly and help each other become better Baltimorians!","lon":-76.5400009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/1\/highres_435963889.jpeg","photo_id":435963889,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/1\/600_435963889.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/3\/1\/thumb_435963889.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":80939432,"name":"Siddhartha Telang","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/1\/1\/highres_242301521.jpeg","photo_id":242301521,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/1\/1\/member_242301521.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/1\/1\/thumb_242301521.jpeg"}},"members":599,"name":"I Meditate Baltimore Group Meditators","id":11428542,"state":"MD","urlname":"I-meditate-Baltimore-meditators","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Effortless Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1386827319000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mandarin-pronunciation","name":"Mandarin Pronunciation","id":20984},{"urlkey":"daily-mandarin-conversation","name":"Daily Mandarin Conversation","id":20985},{"urlkey":"mandarin-language","name":"Mandarin Language","id":51192},{"urlkey":"learning-chinese","name":"Learning Chinese","id":56708},{"urlkey":"lets-learn-mandarin-together","name":"Let's learn Mandarin together","id":71213},{"urlkey":"practice-chinese-langauge-skills","name":"Practice Chinese Language Skills","id":73507},{"urlkey":"mandarin-for-professionals","name":"Mandarin for Professionals","id":104362},{"urlkey":"mandarin-learning","name":"Mandarin Learning","id":106949},{"urlkey":"chinese-language","name":"Chinese language","id":125467},{"urlkey":"mandarin-chinese","name":"Mandarin Chinese","id":127454},{"urlkey":"learn-mandarin","name":"Learn Mandarin","id":127456},{"urlkey":"business-mandarin","name":"Business mandarin","id":159699},{"urlkey":"learn-to-speak-mandarin","name":"Learn to speak Mandarin","id":463252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/QuickMandarin\/","rating":5,"description":"We are a Washington, DC Mandarin language meet-up for busy beginning and intermediate language students to practice for short times on a weekly basis.

Disaster Aid USA utilizes the 4 Way Test and guiding principles of Rotary, and adheres to the United Nations and Sphere Standards while providing disaster relief and humanitarian aid. The club performs a number of community service projects including: Margaret Brent Fun Day, where we provide games, pony rides, clowns, pizza, etc to students with special needs and their staff; and food baskets for families in need; we sponsor six high school students to attend the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA) conference; dictionaries for 3rd grade students; Christmas Stockings for children of incarcerated inmates at the Prince George's County Detention Center; weekend snack program for elementary school students; and backpacks for elementary school students.

Since we, as Gen X'ers, in our older\/wiser age, tend to be more selective about where and how we travel, this group\u2019s focus is on non-touristy, responsible travel (to local, domestic and international destinations). <br> <\/p>\n<p>Non-touristy just means high-quality trips to cool, distinctive destinations (e.g., Iceland) with lots of character, as opposed to the cheapest vacations to the same old touristy spots. Responsible simply means patronizing locally-owned hotels and restaurants so that we give back - the money you spend stays in the local community, which is not the case with most mass tourism that only works with the huge international chains.<\/p>\n<p>Besides that as a guiding principle, we go wherever we want to go! Near and far, domestic and international, beach and city, mountains and lakes, adventure and relaxation, long weekends and weekend to weekends, and anywhere in between or longer! This is our travel club and it\u2019s all about us! So if you like to travel to cool, fun places and are looking for like-minded, new friends to travel with, then this is the group for you!<\/p>\n<p>How do we decide where to go? Easy\u2026 while I\u2019ll offer some trips for consideration, we\u2019ll chat about locales of interest that you have... here online, and at local meet-ups at different bars &amp; restaurants in the city.

Always new places to check out &amp; many neighborhoods to keep up with\u2026 so might as well check them out with new friends and do some travel planning at the same time! We also can do other types of quality, local Baltimore outings (e.g., walks\/hikes, volunteering) to keep in touch, continue our travel ideas, and build lasting friendships with our fellow city and metro neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>[Note: This group is the Baltimore-based, sister meetup group of the Washington DC Gen X Travel Club.] <br> <\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/5\/c\/highres_326997692.jpeg","photo_id":326997692,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/5\/c\/600_326997692.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/5\/c\/thumb_326997692.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14040381,"name":"Gail","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/highres_172801462.jpeg","photo_id":172801462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/member_172801462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/6\/thumb_172801462.jpeg"}},"members":719,"name":"Baltimore Gen X Travel Club (late 30s, 40s, early 50s)","id":12446372,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Gen-X-Travel-Club-late-30s-40s-early-50s","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Gen X Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Glen Burnie","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1390679930000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"karaoke","name":"Karaoke","id":1193},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"karaoke-singers","name":"karaoke singers","id":22388},{"urlkey":"dining-and-karaoke","name":"Dining and Karaoke","id":38657},{"urlkey":"karaoke-singing","name":"Karaoke singing","id":44854}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Glen-Burnie-Karaoke-and-Drinks-Meet-Up\/","rating":4.88,"description":"<p>Do you sing in your car or in the shower?

Use a recent photo of yourself so people can recognize you when you attend any events.\u00a0 That means if someone does something you think is unsafe, don\u2019t do it with them. If that doesn't work for you, tell them about your concerns directly or whoever organized the event that you are uncomfortable, or email the organizers.

Shortly after, it was decided that having such a resource was, not just helpful, but integral for motivation, creativity, and the editorial process of crafting a novel.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Thusly, the Silver Spring Novelist group was born. Our goal is to form a community of local novelists to support and encourage one another. Our purpose is to present a sponsored venue for that to occur. Our mission is to act as a resource for our fellow writers, offering: places for writers to write amongst their own kind, helpful discussions about the elements of noveling, and critique partners to help move your novel to the next level. All of these will be available through the monthly meetups for members to attend.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>We are seeking novelist from all tiers of expertise and accepting applications, whether just starting out or authored several published novels.

(While we read the poems in Persian, they are immediately translated into English, and the discussions around them are also mostly in English - in other words, the group is open to both English and Persian speakers!)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hafez is an unrivaled &nbsp;spiritual master-poet whose mysticism has continued to win over hearts since the 14th century. The material's beauty and transcendence lends itself to \"never getting old\" with people regularly turning to Hafez's words for guidance.&nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>HAFEZ's devotees<\/b> span the globe: from India to the US, from Germany to Australia. Goethe and Nietzche&nbsp; were devoted fans of Hafez - Goethe went so far as &nbsp;calling Hafez his \"celestial friend.\" Meher Baba was devoted to Hafez. Inayat Khan, who introduced Sufism to the West, revered the man. And Ralph Waldo Emerson waxed lyrical about Hafez, calling him \"a poet for poets.\" I taught a private weekend class on HAFEZ for 5 years, and have drawn from that experience in designing these monthly gatherings.

Please provide your first and last names in your profile. Nick-names are fine if provided with, and not instead of, your real name. Please also have a current picture in your meetup profile. Our vetting process includes a cross-check of other public social media -- most real persons have a consistent presence across Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and\/or Google. We may arrange a phone conversation with an organizer to make sure we're on the same page.

Sorry I am just updating this group now but wanted to do so. I am now 3months post partum and still in the process of getting my body back after the baby. I also have an 11 yr old daughter. I do workouts at home mostly and love to do walks and runs. I am really eager to meet with other moms in the area who want to get fit and are looking for an awesome support system to help them get there. I value the team I had for support when I decided to become healthy and fit but most of them live in NY and I need women who I am able to meet up with in the area. If this is something you are interested in then this is the group for you :) I am part of The Columbia Association as well and if you also have a membership maybe we can plan a time for the gym. I am open to ideas and would love group interactions and any idea you guys have please let me know :) with the same goals in mind I think we can really make a steady and lifelong change in our health and fitness together! Please msg me with any ideas for meetup days etc.<\/p>","lon":-76.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":5419582,"name":"Karina","photo":{"photo_id":194669152,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/e\/0\/member_194669152.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/e\/0\/thumb_194669152.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"Getting Fit\/Fit Moms group!","id":14215482,"state":"MD","urlname":"Ellicott-City-Gettingfit-fit-moms","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Fantabs!"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1398981004000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"buy-hold-real-estate-investing","name":"Buy & Hold Real Estate Investing","id":30757},{"urlkey":"beginner-new-real-estate-investor","name":"Beginner Real Estate Investing","id":46403},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing-meetings","name":"Real Estate Investing Meetings","id":81332},{"urlkey":"creative-real-estate-investing","name":"Creative Real Estate Investing","id":133219}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Real-Estate-Investors-Network\/","rating":0,"description":"We meetup once a month to help people with their finances and talk about investing.

Our lives have been profoundly impacted by this work, and we host free events to generate interest in PAX workshops in Washington DC, Baltimore and Northern Virginia. PAX Programs is in the business of educating women about men. PAX, the Latin word for \u201cpeace\u201d - and also an acronym for Partnership, Adoration and Xtasy - creates peace between the sexes by providing unique and immediately useful information to women and men. Women will rediscover MEN with compassion, understanding and the ability to get what you need from them with less effort and more satisfaction for both of you.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>PAX\u2019s flagship program -- Celebrating Men, Satisfying Women\u00ae -- is a weekend educational workshop for women, which transforms the way women relate to men. It facilitates the reconciliation many women are seeking with men and outlines the skills necessary for women to realize powerful, satisfying relationships with all of the men in their lives. The Understand Men DC\/Baltimore PAX community also hosts co-ed events so men can join us and learn more about women and learn tools to experience more rewarding relationships with women.

To get to where you want to go in fitness, and in life you have to have a plan... That's why you joined our 6 Week Transformation Program after all, right? You wanted things like: *Guidance in your nutrition, exercise, and health endeavors. *You wanted accountability. *And you probably wanted to be inspired. Good news my friend - WE *CAN*deliver you results in all those areas of your life! ...But what about the times when you're not around the team? Will you be living a life that is congruent with fat burning success? -or- Will you be sending yourself deeper into the endless pit of over-indulgence that got you fat in the first place? Only you know the answer to these -4- questions, so that's why it's mandatory that you take a few moments out of your day to answer them immediately. =========================================== 4 Big Questions That Will Make or Break Your Fat-Loss Goals =========================================== *Question #1: What kind of weight loss results do you want to achieve? *Question #2: Who are the 5 people that you spend the most time with in your life currently? *Question #3: Do these people have the same goals\/ambitions that you have in terms of your weight loss goals? *Question #4: If they do have the same passion\/goals\/ambitions as you do, then how can you incorporate them more into your life? Take a few minutes to answer these questions and we will talk it over, o.k.? :-) -Tick- -Tock- -Tick- -Tock- -Tick- All done yet? You are? AWESOME! Let's go over your results and see where they all stack up! ====================== The Rule of 5 And You ====================== You probably are wondering why I decided to have you answer these 4 questions tonight, right? The truth is this... I want you to succeed, and succeed at a monumental level so that you can get to your goal as soon as humanly possible. Chances are since you took the time to answer these questions you do too, right? Good! That means that we're both on the same page, and since we got that out of the way let's break down the Rule of 5 and what it means to you. Studies show that the 5 people you spend the most time with directly influence your thoughts, your values, your actions, your income, your goals, and even your weight loss. (Note: It's true, birds of a feather *DO* flock together!) When you put that into perspective, and you look over your answers you have to make a big decision? Do any of those people share your same values and goals in terms of fat loss? Are these people in shape, or are they even worse off than you are right now? If they are out of shape, do they want to make a change? In reality, are these 5 people positively or negatively affecting your life and your weight loss goals? ===================== I'll Cut To The Chase! ===================== If these 5 people are not helping you get to your goals, and they do not share the same vision as you do, then you need to eliminate them from your life, or minimize your interaction with them. But what if they are helping you move towards your goals? - OR- They are in position to make a big change just like you? What do you do with these people? The answer is simple: *Keep them around. *Spend more time with them. *And encourage them while they simultaneously encourage you! ==================== Here's How I Can Help! ==================== Because I want to help you succeed, and I want you to surround yourself with other like-minded people, I want to hook you and your friends up with 1-free week of training to try us out and experience the incredible fat burning results that you're achieving training here with us. Pretty cool, right? Want to know what's even cooler? Not only will you surround yourself with other positive like-minded people who will encourage you on your fat loss journey, but you'll even get half-off your next month of training for every friend that signs up and becomes a new member! In a nutshell, *EVERYONE* wins! On that note, I can't wait to see *YOU* and *YOUR* army of \"fat burning friends\" at your next workout! P.S. If you have anyone special in mind you don't even have to contact them!<\/p>","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8852679,"name":"Alita","photo":{"photo_id":168748142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/d\/e\/e\/member_168748142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/d\/e\/e\/thumb_168748142.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"6 Weeks to SEXY BOOTCAMP - DC\/SILVER SPRING","id":15146092,"state":"MD","urlname":"6weekstosexy","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":39,"who":"Sexy Beast"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1403063604000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"neighbors","name":"Neighbors","id":4189},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"neighborhood-watch","name":"Neighborhood Watch","id":20980},{"urlkey":"neighborhood","name":"Neighborhood","id":29035},{"urlkey":"neighborhood-unity","name":"Neighborhood Unity","id":33299},{"urlkey":"neighborhood-association","name":"Neighborhood Association","id":93895},{"urlkey":"neighborhood-involvement","name":"Neighborhood Involvement","id":948192}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Falkland-Chase-Tenants-Association\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This meetup is for residents of the Falkland Chase Apartments in Silver Spring, MD.<\/p>\n<p>We are a pro-active group of neighbors committed to making Falkland Chase a better place to live. \u00a0We hope to engage JBG, the property owners, in working with us in this effort.<\/p>\n<p>Our group is organized around discussion forums. \u00a0We invite you to participate in as many of the forums as you would like -- and to suggest new forums on issues that are important to you.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the \"Discussions\" link above, and then on \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Falkland-Chase-Tenants-Association\/messages\/boards\/forum\/16752412\">Falkland Chase Tenants Association Discussion Forums<\/a>\" for the current list of discussion topics.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please suggest additional topics by clicking on the \"Discussions\" link above, and then on the\u00a0\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Falkland-Chase-Tenants-Association\/messages\/boards\/thread\/45089942\">Suggested Topics<\/a>\" forum.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":700627,"name":"Diane ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/d\/3\/highres_252977619.jpeg","photo_id":252977619,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/d\/3\/member_252977619.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/d\/3\/thumb_252977619.jpeg"}},"members":41,"name":"Falkland Chase Tenants Association","id":15156922,"state":"MD","urlname":"Falkland-Chase-Tenants-Association","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":39,"who":"Neighbors"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Lanham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1403119332000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"real-estate-deals","name":"Real Estate deals","id":64969},{"urlkey":"real-estate-leads","name":"Real Estate Leads","id":678112},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing-for-wealth","name":"Real Estate Investing for wealth","id":678122}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Deals-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/leadstodeals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/IMAG01021.jpg\"><\/p> \n<p>** Do you have a good DEAL that you want to share?<\/p> \n<p>** Are you looking for your 1st or NEXT real estate DEAL?<\/p> \n<p>** Are you looking for private or hard money, contractors, motivated sellers, tenants, or buyers?<\/p> \n<p>** Want to KNOW how local investors are putting together profitable DEALS<\/p> \n<p>** Would you like to network, eat, and \u2018talk shop\u2019 with the area\u2019s most experienced deal makers?<\/p> \n<p>If you answered \u201cYES!\u201d to any of these questions, you MUST attend our \u201cDEALS or KNOW DEALS\u201d meeting. &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>1st Wednesday of the Month &lt;br&gt;

So, let's spend time together sharing our relationship issues and possibilities, working on them and benefiting from each others' as well. We'll make real progress on our relationships and ourselves that will make a difference in our businesses and our lives.<\/p>\n<p>We lose time and energy in heaps when our relationships aren't working as well as they can, whether they are professional or personal. When our relationships aren't working, we may be cranky, stressed, intimidated, disillusioned, vengeful, preoccupied and any of those things will affect our focus, resolve and our well-being. We won't be at our best and we'll wind up putting too much on ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>If you look closely, you'll see just how much money your relationships are costing you because you may not be taking necessary risks, you may be shut down in a particular area, you may be lacking the support you need and unwilling to reach out to resources or potential income that could be game-changing.<\/p>\n<p>For everyone in the world of startups, and that includes all creative people, like artists and musicians as well as people with private practices, like accountants and doctors, your relationships will also be vital when you start transitioning from the person with a dream to the person with a business, because things like delegation, workplace communication and collaboration become more vital than ever when you can't intimately oversee everything going on.<\/p>\n<p>If your personal relationships are not energy-providing, you may take your home issues to the office in the form of not having restful sleep, arriving already frustrated, spending time on \"work\" that could be spent on the relationship which can lead to diminishing returns, etc. All of our relationships contribute to the person we are being for our business, whether we are putting our best foot forward and being the leaders we need to be for the success of our endeavor. If those relationships are working, it feels like all of our energies are going in the same direction, which can bring huge time and energy gains from feeling understood, supported and appreciated for who we are and for our choices.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there's our relationships with ourselves, which couldn't be more vital. How much we trust ourselves, believe that what we're up to is valuable, feel connected to our work and feel appreciated for our work can make such a difference. This can determine whether we show up as an exciting and magnetic maverick, a tiresome techie, or just self-involved. An empowered relationship with ourselves can be a great asset at the moment(s) of truth for your business.<\/p>\n<p>We'll work on all of these vital elements of our business relationships via meeting topics like: What are you Worth?, Disabling your Distractions, The Distortion of Fear, (Re)Defining Success, Building Relationships that Pay and Treating Yourself Right, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to leading us through this process together in a way that will hopefully profit you greatly.<\/p>","lon":-77.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/9\/0\/highres_400535472.jpeg","photo_id":400535472,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/9\/0\/600_400535472.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/9\/0\/thumb_400535472.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6420171,"name":"Gregg DeMammos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/e\/4\/highres_220196292.jpeg","photo_id":220196292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/e\/4\/member_220196292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/e\/4\/thumb_220196292.jpeg"}},"members":343,"name":"Master Your Business Relationships","id":16514762,"state":"DC","urlname":"Master-Your-Business-Relationships","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":38.9599990845,"who":"Business Leaders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bowie","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1408636586000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"high-tech","name":"high tech","id":35305},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"software-product-management","name":"Software Product Management","id":42278},{"urlkey":"tech-savvy-entrepreneurs","name":"Tech Savvy Entrepreneurs","id":43223},{"urlkey":"high-tech-ventures","name":"High-Tech Ventures","id":57883},{"urlkey":"new-product-development-software-tech","name":"New Product Development: Software & Tech","id":62946},{"urlkey":"tech-talks","name":"Tech Talks","id":91146},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595},{"urlkey":"innovation-clean-tech","name":"Innovation & Clean Tech","id":146919}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bowie-Lean-Start-Up-Network\/","rating":4.55,"description":"<p>This is a lean meetup that is in the process of being built out for networking, technology improvements, and learning.

As a result, many members of our community do not receive the help they need to cope with their illness. Because of the stigma associated with mental illness in minority communities, many suffer quietly and alone. This group provides support for those minorities who suffer from a mental illness-namely bipolar and depression. Our group is also open to families and friends of minorities with bipolar or depression. Our purpose is two-fold: 1. We aim to provide support through fellowship in a variety of ways-whether through talk sessions, a Sunday afternoon BBQ, or a volunteering event. 2. Help to raise awareness of mental illness in minority communities in an effort to erase the stigma associated with it. As an African American woman diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have dealt with many challenges associated with the disease-from strained and broken relationships to problems on the job. After a life changing event that left me lonely and in a financial bind, I decided that I would no longer allow my illness to control my life. I was determined to fight back. And no better way is there to fight back than to join others with bipolar or depression for fun and fellowship.

Mindfulness meditation is not just practiced on the cushion, through sitting meditation, but it is incorporated in all that we do in our daily lives, moment by moment. In mindfulness we learn to clear our minds, open our hearts, and live life fully through our bodies. Through this process we open up to a greater sense of wholeness and wellbeing within ourselves and a vast connectedness with others and the world. As we build the muscles of mindfulness meditation, we live more fully in the present moment and experience life from a greater stillness, which aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety, and stress. Thirty years of research has indicated that mindfulness meditation is associated with significant decreases in stress, pain, physical and emotional distress (including depression, anxiety, grief and loss), and improvements in sleep, energy, health outcomes, and quality of life.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>TEACHERS:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n <b>NANCY BRUTSCH\u00c9, MSN, RN, PMHCNS-BC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/a\/c\/event_177556812.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\" height=\"160\" width=\"149\"><\/p>\n<p>I am a board certified Clinical Nurse Specialist and psychotherapist with 30 years experience in health and wellness and a specialty in mood and anxiety disorders.

Spending money you don't have is a recipe for disaster. Thus, we believe in FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.<\/p> \n<p>2. More government is rarely the solution to a problem. Thus, we believe in LIMITED GOVERNMENT.<\/p> \n<p>3. Each individual must acknowledge primary responsibility for his own well-being and that of his family. Thus, we believe in PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY<\/p> \n<p>4. Every judge and prosecutor has a duty to apply the law as it is written, not as he or she wishes it could be. Thus, we believe in THE RULE OF LAW.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;5. The people, as individuals, and as members of each state and nation should determine for themselves the laws which will govern their lives. Thus, we believe in SOVEREIGNTY.<\/p> \n<p>&nbsp;If you believe that Maryland is worth fighting for, and that America is worth fighting for, join us.<\/p>","lon":-76.6999969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/4\/c\/highres_408071852.jpeg","photo_id":408071852,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/4\/c\/600_408071852.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/4\/c\/thumb_408071852.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":14171182,"name":"Gregory Fisher","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/7\/6\/highres_204492662.jpeg","photo_id":204492662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/7\/6\/member_204492662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/7\/6\/thumb_204492662.jpeg"}},"members":64,"name":"Maryland Tea Party","id":16884042,"state":"MD","urlname":"Maryland-Tea-Party","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":39.0699996948,"who":"Tea Partiers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410291144000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"french","name":"French Language","id":185},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"french-culture","name":"French Culture","id":21183},{"urlkey":"french-american","name":"French American","id":22404},{"urlkey":"francophiles","name":"Francophiles","id":27564},{"urlkey":"francophone-culture","name":"Francophone Culture","id":30474},{"urlkey":"french-food","name":"French Food","id":30873},{"urlkey":"travel-speak-french","name":"Travel & Speak French","id":45560},{"urlkey":"learning-french","name":"Learning French","id":46786},{"urlkey":"french-speaking-community","name":"French Speaking Community","id":52971},{"urlkey":"french-speaking-community-french-teachers","name":"French Speaking Community, French Teachers","id":53170},{"urlkey":"french-cinema","name":"French Cinema","id":77218},{"urlkey":"french-as-a-second-language","name":"French as a Second Language","id":92135},{"urlkey":"french-literature","name":"French Literature","id":104875},{"urlkey":"make-new-friends-around-french-culture-language","name":"make new friends around French culture & language","id":1056382}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Alliance-Francaise-de-Washington-DCs-MEET-UP\/","rating":4.88,"description":"<p>Francophones of the world, Unite!

I am also the owner of Speech Therapy Enterprises LLC wherein I work with a multitude of communication cases. There are many reasons why people want to learn the \u201cEnglish Pronunciation\u201d of language. Foreign born speakers of the English language have to navigate socially and professional while living in America. For some, it is critical to speak the English language with clarity in order to obtain or keep a professional job. Enhance your telephone speaking skills or professional presentation skills. Some ESL (English as a Second Language) speakers need to reduce their accent in order to increase their income. Reduce the accent, not the pay. Learn to \u201cCode Switch\u201d between meeting with friends to meeting with co-workers to increase understanding.

try out Gwendolyn for free. &nbsp;Just let them know at the desk. &nbsp;The cost to try out Vansville is $6.00. &nbsp;I will pay the fee for any player who shows up with goalie gear and plays in net. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, the prices are incredible. &nbsp;It is only $30.00 to play in Gwendolyn year round for residents of Montgomery County. &nbsp;$45.00 for non-county residents. &nbsp;And that gets you free entry to any open gym sport in the county's dozen or so rec centers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At Vansville, it is $40.00. &nbsp;And, just like Gwendolyn, your membership fee gets your free entry into any open gym sport in Prince George's county. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I provide the hockey balls, lend out hockey sticks and provide the white hockey tape with which we must tape the bottom of our hockey sticks to protect each center's floors. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, we have a great time each and every time we play in both centers....so please join us

We both enjoy happy hours (or drinks in general, regardless of the title lol), brunches, dinners out, festivals, fun runs, dancing, concerts, local events, themed parties\/events, pub crawls, weekend getaways aaaaaand so on and so on \u2013 basically anything fun and we\u2019re in! We\u2019d love to meet some other ladies who share the same interests and are looking to build new friendships while taking on the town. We both work full-time so most events will happen on weeknights or weekends. Can\u2019t wait to meet you ladies soon!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","lon":-76.6299972534,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":143846812,"name":"Kristine","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/a\/c\/5\/highres_242307333.jpeg","photo_id":242307333,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/a\/c\/5\/member_242307333.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/a\/c\/5\/thumb_242307333.jpeg"}},"members":229,"name":"Federal Hill & Harbor East Ladies Meetup","id":18182658,"state":"MD","urlname":"Federal-Hill-Ladies-Meetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":39.2700004578,"who":"Hill & Harbor Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Belcamp","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1415805300000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"book-lovers","name":"Book lovers","id":33669},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966},{"urlkey":"coffee-books","name":"Coffee & Books","id":41901}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HCPL-Books-on-Tap\/","rating":4.78,"description":"Harford County Public Library's Books on Tap offers bold titles and refreshing talk at local establishments across the county...

Whole women make SMART decisions and know their value. We refer to ourselves as Diamonds and we are priceless! We bring out the BEST in each other! We plan events that cater to EVERY aspect of your life. We workout together, travel together, save and invest together, pray together, solve problems together. We encourage and RESPECT our sisters at all times This group will strengthen your finances, your relationships, your health and emotional well-being and your spirit. We don't plan events, we create experiences. Designed to help you grow, explore the unique and live OUTSIDE \"the box\". Deep, introspective and amazing!...Not for EVERYONE...only women who want to be wiser, stronger, smarter...who are bold enough to SAY...I WANT MORE. More money, more respect, more love, more self-worth, more adventures, more of ME! My best self. When you bring your best self to every situation, you have the confidence to demand MORE. We limit our group numbers and focus on growth from the INSIDE out. We want active, committed members who ADD to the warm loving supportive atmosphere that we create at our events. We will be leaving meetup soon and expanding. Going National, as we will be featured in a book that we expect to be a National best seller.

Our community includes single, married, and those with families. We do a variety of activities (HH, shopping, Guys or Girls\u2019 Night Out, pet sitting, play dates for kids, traveling, game nights, book club, ride to airport, etc.) As always, you should be cautious and meet in public first.

Member experience ranges from just becoming familiar with the craft beer scene to longtime homebrewing.&nbsp; All levels of experience are welcome!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re nonjudgmental about the styles and brands our members like, because people\u2019s tastes differ.&nbsp; My mantra has always been that you should drink what you like, but try a different style occasionally, because your tastes might change.&nbsp; That\u2019s part of the experience - trying different styles and expanding your knowledge of craft beer.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>We have meetups in many different locations in Maryland.&nbsp; I tend to call them - be they happy hour, brewery tour, or beer festival - in the Crofton, Gambrills, Annapolis, Columbia, and Baltimore areas.&nbsp; But we\u2019ve recently looked farther away for meetup locations, in places such as Frederick and Southern Maryland.&nbsp; We may even call a few meetups in DC and Virginia, too, depending on member response.&nbsp; I\u2019m always looking for new breweries, brewpubs, and beer bars to add to our list, so please don\u2019t be shy about letting me know what your favorite beer bar or brewery is, or maybe one to which you\u2019ve never been but would like to visit. <\/p>\n<p>We have our regular meetup at Frisco Tap House - the group\u2019s sponsor - in Gambrills (Crofton), on the last Wednesday of each month.&nbsp; I\u2019ve recently considered moving the day of the week to Tuesday, to coincide with Frisco\u2019s weekly Pint Night, and may be making that change shortly.&nbsp; If you\u2019ve never been, I urge you to attend one of these monthly meetups, or visit it yourself: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.friscotaphouse.com\/\">http:\/\/www.friscotaphouse.com\/<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>I hope that, with your participation, we can make this a fun and educational group.&nbsp; Again, welcome!<\/p>\n<p><i>About me:&nbsp; I\u2019ve been an avid homebrewer for a long time, and beer and travel related to it are my passions.&nbsp; I hope to attend both the Great American and Great British beer festivals one day.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>I\u2019m pretty knowledgeable about processes, styles, and brands.&nbsp; I\u2019ve always favored British- and Belgian-style ales, but recently discovered that I <b>love<\/b> American black IPAs.&nbsp; This came as a surprise to me, because I don\u2019t tend to like \u201cregular\u201d American IPAs.&nbsp;

At our core will be dining and happy hours. There are lots of fantastic food options right outside our front doors. Apparently there are over 126 food establishments in Wheaton, which gives plenty of options to get out and explore, even after dropping the various fast food joints or the mall food court. I know there are several on my list that I haven't tried yet but want too, and others that I enjoy but just don't get out and frequent enough. Then we'll see what else we want to do. Probably things like getting a group together to head to the TGIF Summer Concert Series and Taste of Wheaton events, having a cookout in Sligo Creek Park or a member's backyard, or ordering takeout or delivery for a game night or to watch a game.

Each member should become involved with the group and everyone should motivate and encourage each other. The ultimate goal is to RELAX and have plenty of FUN. In order to cover the monthly meetup fee, a small yearly fee of no more than $5 will be required and any activity cost. Is this group designed for what you have in mind? If yes, you are welcomed to join us. I am excited to meet all of you !

We are a Moving Group, so Let\u2019s Move.<\/p>\n<p>This group will look to each other to keep motivated since it's easy to lose motivation noting this is the 2nd attempt at this successful group. Members should suggest things to do or even host events themselves.

Everyone moves at the pace that is comfortable to them. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are fast or slow. The slow ones will be encouraged to move as fast as the fast ones and the fast ones will be encouraged to keep striving forwarded or they might end up like the slow ones :-) If you are trying something new, you should consult your doctor 1st.

We share meals, conversation and the routines of daily life, creating a unique cultural encounter and lasting friendships. When we visit or host another club, the club organizes a program of activities to introduce the visitors to the local area (for us, this can include visits to museums, the Capitol, nearby cities such as Annapolis, and more).

People of all political stripes who are open-minded and curious are welcome. The objectives are to 1) bring together participants with diverse political views, 2) conduct a respectful and productive conversation about a difficult topic in a safe environment, and 3) explore possible areas of common ground. To promote these goals, discussions will be loosely structured around a format called \u201cLiving Room Conversations\u201d (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.livingroomconversations.org\/<\/a>), which has been successful in finding common ground between groups as politically disparate as the Tea Party and MoveOn.org.

Since, by definition, existence cannot come from non-existence, an accurate understanding of reality itself requires the acceptance of an \u201cArche\u201d, an eternal and fundamental basis of reality in a constant state of becoming. Aristotle postulated such reality as a conversion of potential into actuality in an all-encompassing process termed \u201cEntelechy\u201d. This perspective allows for a pivotal understanding of life, intelligence and the divine as evolutionary events occurring along a continuum. God is traditionally viewed as the pinnacle of intelligence, power, and complexity, but existence cannot begin with such qualities. Rather, the universe evolves in complexity over time: it was not created by God, but is God <i>in potentia<\/i>. Thus we can propose a unification of science and religion in which a creator God is a logical impossibility, but God as the end-product of cosmic evolution is logical. The Universe is converting infinite potential into maximum actualization; and we are participants in the entire process, which is perhaps the ultimate meaning of life.<\/p>","lon":-77.0199966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":25364842,"name":"Antonei Benjamin Csoka","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/highres_67294722.jpeg","photo_id":67294722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/member_67294722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/a\/2\/thumb_67294722.jpeg"}},"members":112,"name":"Idealism Institute","id":18503089,"state":"DC","urlname":"Idealism-Institute","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":38.9500007629,"who":"Idealists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426578933000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"urbanexplor","name":"Urban Exploration","id":4331},{"urlkey":"history","name":"History","id":7789},{"urlkey":"arthistory","name":"Art History","id":9255},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"cemeteries","name":"Cemeteries","id":16955},{"urlkey":"local-history","name":"local history","id":25191},{"urlkey":"death-and-dying","name":"Death and Dying","id":49371},{"urlkey":"cultural-studies","name":"Cultural Studies","id":57839},{"urlkey":"graveyards","name":"Graveyards","id":114350},{"urlkey":"cemetery-tours","name":"Cemetery Tours","id":158950}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/grave-friends\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p>This is a group for people who want to spend more time in the glorious cemeteries in the Baltimore area.

I will concentrate on those two areas. The kind of camera you have will not matter. I believe you can create a great portrait with the best camera around or a cell phone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You should &nbsp;know how to work your camera. There are many other factors such as backgrounds, clothing and the message you want to convey that go into creating a portrait. Those will all be addressed as needed or in a separate class. The classes are for people who want to improve their people portraits. Anyone can pick up a camera these days and take a photo but to take a portrait to the next level requires more thought, understanding and a lot of practice. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I'd like to see how the group evolves, but for now we'll&nbsp;get together on location, near Silver Spring, Bethesda and NW and learn about natural portrait posing and lighting. Sometimes we will go for an urban look and other times we might go to a park. We will look for lighting situations that mimic studio lighting without lighting equipment (except maybe a reflector). We will pose each other as singles, couples and groups and occasionally we'll have a model. Next fall I may teach studio portraits. Most of the time we'll meet on Saturday morning and be done before noon. <br><\/p>\n<p>I look forward to sharing with you.

This group is for promoting health and wellness through an ancient practice called QiGong. What is Qigong? Qigong focuses on improving physical health and wellness. It opens the energy flow within the body by eliminating blockages. The intent is to balance the body by opening the energetic pathways (meridians). This is accomplished by a series of gentle movements synchronized with the breath. This form of Qigong can be safely practiced by the beginner, with limited movement, to the most advanced student. It benefits all students and aides them in moving forward no matter what their prior experiences. Each class is started with a set of Opening Moves to allow the body structure to open in all directions. Next, we move through the Qigong movements. These movements focus on Energy passing through specific pathways (or meridians). The class ends with a closing Qigong form that integrates the mind-body-spirit to a more grounded state of well-being. Qigong is an excellent tool to acquire mind-body-spirit awareness. Its movements provide a path toward personal transformation. Each individual may have a different experience each time they practice the form. The goal is as they work toward balance of the Yin-Yang Qi they will notice improved health, increased energy and a greater awareness of life. What are the benefits? Qigong enhances immune function, reduces the ill effects of stress, prevents disease, calms the mind and emotions, lowers blood pressure, increases flexibility, cultivates energy, treats chronic pain, and improves sleep.<\/p>","lon":-76.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":86625662,"name":"joff headley","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/highres_245134649.jpeg","photo_id":245134649,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/member_245134649.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/thumb_245134649.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Laurel Qigong Meetup","id":18535847,"state":"MD","urlname":"Laurel-Qigong-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.0999984741,"who":"qi members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hyattsville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428520023000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"homeless","name":"Homelessness","id":3777},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"family-and-friends","name":"Family and Friends","id":16929},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"healthy-lifestyles","name":"Healthy Lifestyles","id":32598},{"urlkey":"event-planning-fundraising","name":"Event Planning & Fundraising","id":77233},{"urlkey":"ptsd-recovery","name":"PTSD Recovery","id":88088},{"urlkey":"military-and-veterans","name":"Military and Veterans","id":91416},{"urlkey":"grief-recovery","name":"Grief Recovery","id":105011},{"urlkey":"homeless-outreach","name":"Homeless Outreach","id":168756},{"urlkey":"complementary-and-alternative-therapies","name":"Complementary and Alternative Therapies","id":1064432}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VeteransForeverSoldiers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Veterans Forever Soldiers (VFS) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization with a mission to Honor, Respect, and Care for United States Military Veterans.

As the host and sex health educator, I ensure you'll meet great people, industry experts and fellow Sexologist that work throughout Washington DC.

We chat, have questions and entertaining dialogue about our topic. &nbsp;The topic last for no more than a hour so you can make it home and have a restful night.<\/p>\n<p>What's Next?<\/p>\n<p>Libido Talk is geared towards&nbsp;building&nbsp;the community we all envision. That community includes: couples, singles, parents, kinksters, LGBTQ'ers, pansexuals, eroticist and more. &nbsp;You are never too young or too old for these conversations and revelations. We are growing. &nbsp;We want to grow communities of sexually educated people so we change the face of STI\/STD prevalence, increase healthy consenting relationships, and model healthy sexual pride and integrity for young people. We are a growing brand and look to build our audience in larger forums. &nbsp;Your attendance helps us grow, helps us inform, and helps us build a sex-positive community for all.<\/p>\n<p>PS. Don't forget to check out our sponsors, we are building, so take advantage of cool discounts.<\/p>\n<br>\n<br>","lon":-77.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/0\/b\/highres_445471499.jpeg","photo_id":445471499,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/0\/b\/600_445471499.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/0\/b\/thumb_445471499.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":159662602,"name":"Frenchie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/b\/c\/highres_224945052.jpeg","photo_id":224945052,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/b\/c\/member_224945052.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/b\/c\/thumb_224945052.jpeg"}},"members":200,"name":"DC: Libido Talk presents: HH\/Sex Chats\/and more, more, more!","id":18552031,"state":"DC","urlname":"Washington-Dating-and-Relationships-Adult-Fun-Workshops","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":38.9500007629,"who":"Libido Talkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1429325024000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"linux","name":"Linux","id":188},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"ciscosystems","name":"Cisco Systems","id":10120},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"network-engineering","name":"Network Engineering","id":26118},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"data-mining","name":"Data Mining","id":55324},{"urlkey":"cybersecurity","name":"Cybersecurity","id":152026},{"urlkey":"network-technology","name":"Network Technology","id":252781},{"urlkey":"software-defined-networking","name":"Software Defined Networking","id":537492},{"urlkey":"juniper-networks","name":"Juniper Networks","id":706092},{"urlkey":"ccna-ccnp-ccda-ccdp-ccvp-ccsp-ccip-ccie-ccde","name":"CCNA CCNP CCDA CCDP CCVP CCSP CCIP CCIE CCDE","id":837702}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Charm-City-Net-Tech\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Today, 40% of the world population has internet connectivity.

Are you a single black woman, that&nbsp;has realized that everyone around you has kids and\/or married and you feel left out? You often find yourself the only one at events with no kids and husband, maybe a boyfriend. It's fun chilling and spending time with our boyfriends, but every woman needs good girlfriends too. Men don't always want to do what we want to do.&nbsp;Do you often find yourself not having many girlfriends or&nbsp;female relatives&nbsp;to hang out with&nbsp;any more because they have relocated, gotten married, have&nbsp;mommy duties or have a certain time to be home.&nbsp;Do you sometimes&nbsp;find yourself sitting at home on a beautiful sunny day with no girlfriends&nbsp;to chill with. Or on a weekend night watching Lifetime, LMN&nbsp;or Bravo? Do you just want to be spontaneous sometimes and just call and&nbsp;say let's go out or do something fun?&nbsp;This group is for heterosexual, Christian, &nbsp;professional, classy, intelligent, positive and drama-free and like-minded women that are seeking to socialize and build true lasting friendships that will develop into a sisterhood. This will be a small group to foster a close knit and engaging atmosphere. The group will consist of women that are supportive, encouraging, inspirational and uplifting&nbsp;to one another. Let's engage in some awesome activities, while developing bonds and making memories that will last a lifetime. Some of the activities include: dining, brunch, lounges,&nbsp;cruises, festivals, concerts, plays, broadway musicals, live bands, weekend getaways, movies, spas, picnics and day trips. Having&nbsp;children or getting married doesn't define you,&nbsp;they enhance your life. We never know what God has in store for us. Until then,&nbsp;let's live our lives and enjoy us until we do get married and become moms.&nbsp;If you are interested in meeting other wonderful, like-minded ladies to explore the DMV and so much more, please join this group. I understand that sometimes you won't be able to attend every outing, but please be an active participant to make this group a success. This is not just a meetup but friendship group. Constant no shows will lead to the member being deleted from the group.<b>&nbsp;Currently this group is closed to new members.<\/b><\/p>","lon":-76.8499984741,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12883359,"name":"Ms. Liss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/highres_245843547.jpeg","photo_id":245843547,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/member_245843547.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/thumb_245843547.jpeg"}},"members":135,"name":"Laurel Sisterhood Meetup Ages 30-40 (Single\/Without Kids)","id":18573534,"state":"MD","urlname":"Lovely-Ladies-of-Laurel-Meetup-Ages-33-39-Single-No-Kids","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":39.0600013733,"who":"Lovely Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430603561000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"trail-running","name":"Trail Running","id":16301},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"beginners-running","name":"Beginner's Running","id":24325},{"urlkey":"womens-running","name":"Women's Running","id":37072},{"urlkey":"long-distance-running","name":"Long Distance Running","id":38289},{"urlkey":"road-running","name":"Road Running","id":49699},{"urlkey":"running-with-friends","name":"Running with Friends","id":92083},{"urlkey":"running-training","name":"running training","id":99282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BaltimoreRATrunners\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>We are a social running group that welcomes people of all paces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While Baltimore is known for its rats that scurry underneath, we scurry over Roads And Trails --we are the Baltimore RAT Runners.&nbsp;It seems many of our runners are new to town, so if \"B'more\" and \"Hon\" are new to you, you should feel right at home with us.<\/p> \n<p>Our Monday runs start at 6:45 p.m. next to the Under Armour store on S.
