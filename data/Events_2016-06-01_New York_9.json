The\u00a0Sue et Mare couch came from Karl Lagerfeld's collection, and a maze of other low-to-the-ground loungers such as a\u00a0kiss-shaped velour loveseat are similarly flamboyant. The skyline twinkles beyond floor-to-ceiling windows framed\u00a0by white curtains, but the scene is even more impressive on the massive roof deck where an endless array of wood\u00a0benches and sturdy garden chairs invite no less than 500 quitting-timers and night owls to take in unobstructed\u00a0views of the Empire State Building to the north, the Met Life building to the east, and Jersey to the west.

The concept of 'getting' implies lack and loss which is why You Always lose or experience loss whenever you attempt to 'get or gain'... Conversely, You Can Always Have because You Do Always Have... but in order To Retain awareness of What You Have, You Must Share Having... And this idea of Having goes completely against the entire framework and logic of your separate self thought system... which is why Jesus says, '<b>To Have All, Give All in order To Know You Have All'...<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>We hope you'll join us this Tuesday to read and discuss this powerful and expansive idea.

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Some of us \"trash talk\" when we play, but it's all in good fun &amp; in the spirit of gaming.<\/p> <p>- This is a restaurant\/bar so accidents are bound to happen. However, if you're responsible for ruining someone else's game by spilling a beverage or food on it, the right thing to do is to offer to purchase a new copy for them. Some of the games we bring are out of print so please treat every board game with respect.<\/p> <p>- If a game is accidentally ruined by a staff member, everyone at the table should pitch in to buy a new one for the owner. More often than not, this comes to about $10\/person or less, so in our opinion it isn't too much to ask for.<\/p> <p>Thanks everyone &amp; see you on Tuesday night!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/431969846974239\/\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers\/events\/230686216\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Weekly Game Night at TGIF","id":"xpqtmlyvhbgc","time":1464130800000,"updated":1464146324000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1355802481000,"name":"Forest Hills Board Gamers","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":6280132,"urlname":"Forest-Hills-Board-Gamers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Board Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"663 Classon Ave","name":"Shoestring Press","lon":-73.958771,"id":17592302,"state":"NY","lat":40.677608,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.27319669724,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456889522000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open Figure Painting Sessions<\/p> <p>April 5 to May 24, weekly, Tuesdays 7 - 10pm<\/p> <p>By popular demand, we're introducing weekly drop-in figure painting sessions, pay as you go.

Meaning you are guaranteed at least 2 matches. This tournament format will not be played at a single location over a weekend instead players are given 7 to 10 days to play each round's match.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Our tournaments will be mixed gender unless we have particularly strong female enrollment in a city. The tournaments will be singles based until we receive enough response to open it up for doubles. Players will be grouped in brackets with players no greater than .5 of their current TLN League Rating. Meaning Skilled - 3.0 players will be matched with other 3.0 players and at most with Competitive - 3.5 level players. Competitive - 3.5 level players could be grouped with Advanced - 4.0 players but will not have Elite 4.5 level players in their bracket.<\/p> <p><b>Our Guarantee<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We need at least 6 players to make a tournament bracket. If we can NOT reach this criteria then we will <i>refund<\/i> your entry fee and <i>give you<\/i> the next tournament for <i>no cost<\/i>. Our hope is to run multiple skill level brackets for each tournament. We are NOT going to show early enrollment for the tournaments. Also the 7-day money back guarantee expires as soon as the tournament starts. Tournaments will not allow for late enrollment.<\/p> <p><b>Leveling<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament players will need to have played <i>4 league\/season or tennis ladder legacy matches<\/i> before they can enter into a tournament. Players will be entered into the tournament that associates with their TLN's Player Rating. If a player wants to participate in a second draw at a rating higher than their Player Rating they will be allowed too.<\/p> <p><b>Your Schedule and Availability<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0These tournaments will be kicked off on Thursday's giving the first round opponents two weekends to play the first match and then each following round will have a full week to play the match. Players need to be local for at least the first 3 weeks after kickoff. Players with 1-week work trips or week long vacations during the first 3 weeks shouldn't participate in the tournament.<\/p> <p><b>Seedings<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The TennisNewYork staff will seed 25% of the participants based veteran status (Most number of matches played in their career) with the program. If we have 8 players enrolled we'll seed the top 2 players, 16 players the top 4 players. The rest of the players will be randomly entered into the draw.<\/p> <p><b>Consolation Bracket<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0We will run a consolation bracket for the players who lost their first match. Seedings for the consolation bracket will be randomly selected by the TennisNewYork staff. The winner of the consolation bracket will receive a $25 Tennis Warehouse Gift Card.<\/p> <p><b>Where to Play?<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 Because the seeding of the tournament is mainly randomize the higher seed will NOT have home court preference. The league strongly suggests you meet half-way to cut the commute in half for both players. We provide an extensive list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tennisnewyork.com\/TennisCourts\">tennis courts<\/a> that have user submitted ratings. If two players need guidance they can certainly email our staff for suggestions.<\/p> <p><br\/>Special Note for NYC players: We don't have any special privileges to use the courts throughout New York City. You do need to follow by the rules provided by the Parks Department. How to reserve tennis courts in NYC: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/sub_things_to_do\/facilities\/af_tennis.html\">NYC Park &amp; Rec.<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Playing Format<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 The preferred playing format for tournaments should be 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker or 2 out of 3 sets. If the two players can't agree the default format will be the 2 sets with a 3rd set tie-breaker. In NYC we will accept 10 game pro set results mainly due to court availability.<\/p> <p><b>Target Audience<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 This will be our most competitive format. The target audience is for the player who are good sports and love to play competitive matches.<\/p> <p><b>Prize Pool<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0The prize pool will be based upon enrollment in each bracket. A tournament can have multiple brackets. The tournament prize structure is based around our partner Tennis Warehouse (TW).<\/p> <p><b>6 to 10 players:<\/b> $50 TW Gift Card for the winner*, $25 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation bracket winner<br\/><b>11 to 16:<\/b> $100 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>17 to 24:<\/b> $150 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $50 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd &amp; 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<br\/><b>25+:<\/b> $200 TW GC for the winner* + Trophy, $100 TW GC for Finalist, $25 TW GC for 3rd and 4th place, $50 TW GC for Consolation winner<\/p> <p>\u00a0All tournament champions will be receive an entry into the End of the Year National Tourneys at the champions discounted rate.<\/p> <p><b>Cost to Participate<\/b><\/p> <p>Tourney's have a new cost structure for 2016.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/231324289\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"Tennis This Wednesday @ Crotona Park","id":"231324289","time":1464210000000,"updated":1464293591000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Mount Vernon","address_1":"2 South Sixth Avenue","name":"Pioneer Shooting Center","lon":-73.838936,"id":23499499,"state":"NY","lat":40.910995,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.6698789597,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438282053000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Pioneer Shooting Center would like to invite you to Winchester Wednesdays, our weekly shooting event for the Winchester\/NRA Marksman Qualification Program.

For those who do not RSVP and just show up must wait until 5:30pm and depending upon the order you showed up in and if the conditions mentioned above are not met, you will be allowed to play to make it so the teams are 13 each. If you have RSVP-ed and do not show up by the time we kick off and teams are full, you will be put aside. for those who show up late, I will set some cones aside so you can play a smaller game against anyone else who shows up late.

This achievement is even more impressive as many savvy political consultants called the race incorrectly until election night 2012. Nate Silver's model is outlined on the 538 site and is based on meta-analysis with a series of adjustments. His model is a textbook example of using small-data to make big predictions. In this talk we walk through the model using an IPython notebook.\u00a0<i>Ritesh Bansal studied math and computer science at CMU and econometrics at the Graduate Center of City College. He has worked for over 15 years in the financial industry building and trading models and consulting for hedge funds and banks in risk management. He founded Rational Insights in 2012 to apply machine learning expertise to the domains of finance and politics.\u00a0Jim Schmitz studied math and computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and math and finance at NYU-Courant. He has worked at several hedge funds and investment banks doing quantitative research and trading. He is interested in politics and prediction markets, and once built a computer program to act as a market maker in the Iowa Electronic Markets. He published a research paper on the results, titled \"Algorithmic Trading in the Iowa Electronic Markets.\u201d<br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><b>Lev Konstantinovskiy,\u00a0<\/b><b><i>Word embeddings for fun and profit with gensim<\/i>.<\/b>\u00a0Word embeddings is a family of modern neural network techniques for analysing raw text. In this talk we will show how to use several of these algorithms - word2vec, doc2vec, deep inverse regression and word movers distance. The algorithms will assign a genre to a movie plot with various degrees of success. All examples will be using an open-source Natural Language Processing package gensim.\u00a0<i>Lev is community manager of an open source Natural Language Processing Python package Gensim aka \"Topic modelling for humans\". In the past he counted microseconds in trading and did algebraic geometry . He starts every day with a couple of hours of yoga.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Tony Fast, <i>The Internet Killed the Lab Notebook<\/i>.\u00a0<\/b>Open Source Software is significantly impacting scientific research.\u00a0 Advanced analytics and high performance computing have lower barriers to entry than before.\u00a0 These tools must exist - and they must be accessible - to solve the increasingly difficult real world problems scientists face everyday.\u00a0 Massive scientific collaborations are happening at internet scale.\u00a0 And nearly all other scientific organizations are feeling the pressure to make that transition.\u00a0 Using new tools for a scientist is a big decision and the open source software world is a confusing place.\u00a0 On the journey to digital science, many are going to discover NumFocus sponsorship projects will be in their toolbelt; as many began as scientific research.\u00a0 This talk will expand on the impacts of the PyData community and open source software as it pertains to the modern scientist. \u00a0<i>Tony Fast is a Community Scientist at Continuum Analytics; he is also Co-Founder of PyData Atlanta. \u00a0He uses open source software and the scientific methods to solve everything from Generalized Spherical Harmonics to putting together pizza orders for meetups. \u00a0Tony still lives, eats, and breathes science even after crawling\u00a0out of academia. \u00a0He has taught Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, recieved his Ph.D. in Materials Science from Drexel University, and Bachelor's in Ceramic Engineering at Rutgers University.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Civic Hall is located at 156 5th Avenue on the northwest corner of 20th Street on the second floor.

Peirce (1839 \u2013 1914) The initiator of the only home grown American philosophy, Pragmatism, and the creator of modern semiotics, the polymath Charles S. Peirce (1839 \u2013 1914), worked for a time at formalizing, as a new applied science, his theory of three universal categories, these pervading his work in phenomenology, semiotic, ontology, and many other sciences. He expected this science, trichotomic, to usher in \u201ca new birth of time\u201d much as Aristotle's philosophy had done centuries earlier. This author has developed trikonic as a diagrammatic explication of Peirce's science, but which also expands it in several directions. The hope is that this more iconic expression of Peirce's three-category theory will demonstrate its value in many applications; its basic themes will be explored here.<\/p> <p>It seems to me that we are driven to this, that logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. They must not stop at our own fate, but must embrace the whole community. This community, again, must not be limited, but must extend to all races of beings with whom we can come into immediate or mediate intellectual relation. It must reach, however vaguely, beyond this geological epoch, beyond all bounds. He who would not sacrifice his own soul to save the whole world, is, as it seems to me, illogical in all his inferences, collectively.

Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo.

In that capacity, she serves as a community education facilitator, outreach liaison, seminar leader, marketing team supervisor, and family advisor.

Bring your favorite tools to sketch\/prototype ideas and your laptop.

The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series.

Rock, rap, dubstep, pop and old school music fuse to create the POUNDtrack series, which is hand-selected by music enthusiasts, drummers and POUND founders Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom.<\/p> <p>GET RIPPED WITH RIPSTIX\u2122<\/p> <p>What would a drumming workout be without drumsticks?

We suggest reaching out to other attending through the comments to sit together or meet up at a specific time in the space.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nLast thing, two times a month we'll have a dedicated space for you to come out and work as well as listen to talks and get help from myself and others in the community. Those will be different events you'll need to register for which are separate from the daily co-working space.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Game-Makers\/events\/230926562\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":28800000,"name":"Indie Coworking Space","id":"htvgmlyvhbjc","time":1464271200000,"updated":1464301159000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1360162402000,"name":"New York Game Makers","group_lon":-74,"id":7058352,"urlname":"New-York-Game-Makers","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Game Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11222","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"lorimer street and driggs avenue","name":"McCarren Park","lon":-73.950623,"id":6158322,"state":"NY","lat":40.72171,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":32,"headcount":0,"distance":2.84666895866,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":10,"created":1424368686000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Six years of 10am Tuesday\/Thursday Football at Mc Carren park!<\/p> <p>Games start on time, please be there 10-15m before.<\/p> <p>No sliding tackles, no corners, no CLEATS, small goals 7v7 games.<\/p> <p><b>Bring a positive attitude and\u00a0a Dark and White shirt.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Games are set up for 8v8 (32 attendees) but might go to 9v9 MAX.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

It is a place the German-born photographer has called home for more than a decade.<\/p> <p>New York Love Story evolved out of Staiger\u2019s desire to approach New York from new perspectives and spectacular heights. He has embarked on a journey to create a beautifully photographed, expansive collection of exceptionally high resolution large format photographs of New York City, while simultaneously documenting the entire process with still photography and video.<\/p> <p>From New York City\u2019s highest rooftops, balconies, penthouses and window washing rigs, he chased those fleeting instants leading to the most exciting shots \u2013 the perfect balance between the cityscape below and the sky above. The extraordinary shifts in weather unfolding in front of his lens quickly became an obsession for Staiger to capture the natural beauty of the city.<\/p> <p>A long time artist and commercial photographer, Staiger's understanding of complex lighting and technology, coupled with his fascination of aerial views eventually led him to shift his focus from shooting to advertising campaigns to the skylines of New York City.<\/p> <p>About Karsten Staiger<\/p> <p>Like countless others before him, German-born photographer Karsten Staiger is in love with New York City. As an artist and commercial photographer for more than a decade, Staiger has built his career shooting advertising campaigns for luxury brands and corporations (Hugo Boss, DeBeers, Nextel, Time Warner Cable, among others) in his Chelsea studio. Staiger was at the forefront of the digital revolution that emerged in the 90s; since then he has been a pioneer in utilizing cutting-edge camera technology to create elegant images in extremely high resolution.

He has embarked on a journey to create a beautifully photographed, expansive collection of exceptionally high-resolution large format photographs of New York City, while simultaneously documenting the entire process with still photography and video.

We are not accepting any more players at this time. Feel free to message me and I can reach out if a spot opens up in the future.<\/p> <p><br\/>INTRODUCTION:Until just days ago, most members of our party were blissfully unaware of the Keys of Power and their creator, the Aramago. Even those that had any inkling of these topics thought the stories they\u2019d heard to be mere legends. Then one of the Keys of Power was almost literally dropped in their lap. They were suddenly running for their lives guarding Melrick, the courier ferrying that item to a safe place.<\/p> <p><br\/>Now, Melrick is dead and the party is cast adrift in an alien realm of existence. What\u2019s worse, they\u2019ve been separated from more than half of their number with seemingly no hope to reunite with them. So Theron, Clovis, and Drom cast about for ways to return to their home plane, reunite with their comrades, and most importantly, convey the precious cargo they carry to its rightful place.<\/p> <p><br\/>However, all is not lost. Potential new allies have stepped forward. Already the elven ranger Thamior has shown his worth by warning the party of an impending ambush and nearly dying in helping to fight it off.

It is a shell that encompasses the numerous, separate adventures the players will enjoy during an\u00a0epic\u00a0quest to recover all the Keys of Power.<\/p> <p><br\/>This game is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month. We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Thursday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game. I know this because each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/230036402\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Keeper of the Keys - An Azocar Adventure","id":"ndvsrlyvhbjc","time":1464301800000,"updated":1464314514000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10019","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"USS Maine Monument","name":"USS Maine Monument New York, NY","lon":-73.98114,"id":10140482,"state":"NY","lat":40.768246,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.34580039978,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460995048000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This running group is for anyone who just wants to go for a run and make new friends.<\/b><\/p> <p>If you're looking to get into better shape or become a better runner we can help you with that.<\/p> <p><b>Our main focus is to enjoy the run around Central Park.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We will<\/b> <b>meet at Columbus Circle behind The Main Monument (Pic Below) <\/b>to warm up stretch and have a chance to meet everyone and coordinate the run.<\/p> <p><br\/>We run anywhere from 3-6 miles depending on what everyone is looking to do.<\/p> <p><br\/>We can start off as a group and run as a group if everyone wants to run at the same pace but others are more than welcome to break up into smaller groups for those of you who might want to run a little faster.<\/p> <p><b>Lockers Info: The New York Running company at the Time Warner Center (located on the 2nd floor)<\/b><\/p> <p>has changing rooms, and free bag check also has lockers but you have to bring your own lock and closes at 9pm.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>After each run we head to our local bar DJ Reynolds to grab a drink or two and get something to eat and it gives us a chance to get to know each other.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>I will post what I'll be wearing and my number in the comments section the day of the run.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ee\/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)_Monument_Columbus_Circle_NYC.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ee\/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)_Monument_Columbus_Circle_NYC.JPG<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will post what I'll be wearing and where to find me in the comments section the day of the run.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/231160250\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Fun Run","id":"sdtpslyvhbgc","time":1464301800000,"updated":1464381558000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"237 W. 35th Street","name":"Juniper bar","lon":-73.991539,"id":24190859,"state":"NY","lat":40.752502,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.191075131297,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463244556000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us on Thursday May 26th for a mid-week after work happy hour!

Now, back to discussion, and this month the topic will be <i>Intuition<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Intuition, also sometimes called \"the sixth sense,\" can be defined as <i>\"the ability to sense or know immediately without reasoning.\"<\/i> We all have had hunches, gut feelings, or intuitive insights. The feeling one gets when first hearing about or seeing something or someone, or the first impression when we meet someone new...these are all examples of intuition. These insights swim to the surface of our attention and ask us to do something. Some are big decisions: See the doctor now; marry this man; don't get on that plane. Others are barely perceptible: There's something off about that new guy in accounting\u2014be careful. Intuition is often considered the ability to synthesize and deduce from all of our accumulated unconscious experiences. Therefore, we\u00a0 have the ability to \"know\" more than we realize if we use our (other) five senses to \"tune in\" to our intuition. Those who pay attention can find intuition a useful tool in their lives.<\/p> <p>Let's explore these questions:<\/p> <p>1. What is your personal definition of intuition?<\/p> <p>2. When is it safe to \"go with your gut?\" \u00a0When is it not?<\/p> <p>3. In what circumstances have you used intuition to come up with an answer, solution, or action?<\/p> <p>4. Is intuition more powerful than logic or analytical thinking?<\/p> <p>5. What is the \"right\" balance between\u00a0\"rational\" thought and intuition?<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHere's an interesting article on the subject:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/articles\/200705\/gut-almighty\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/articles\/200705\/gut-almighty\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/articles\/200705\/gut-almighty<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIt's sure to be a great discussion and please be sure to bring your own questions and comments.

The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect.

They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

Under the Colony's watchful eye, this utopia will be free of the humans' penchant for violence, exploitation and religious superstition.

This region is defined as a bioregion. They are a popular tourist destination.<\/p> <p>The lakes' shapes reminded early map-makers of human fingers, and the name stuck.

It was there that he also studied all sorts of things, most notably computer science, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.<\/p> <p>After Stanford, he taught elementary and middle school math and science.\u00a0Working on\u00a0Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign is, to date, the most meaningful and difficult work he's ever done. He also really enjoyed being on the teaching team for\u00a0Design Your Life, a class for undergraduates out of the Stanford Design Program. Early in his career, he served on the initial team at\u00a0Doostang, an online career community which was acquired by Universum Global. He was also part of the team at\u00a0One Block Off The Grid,\u00a0an internet-based solar sales business which was spun out of the incubator Virgance. 1BOG was acquired by Pure Energies Group (now\u00a0$NRG). Among the random work he's\u00a0done, he's consulted with\u00a0a South African private equity firm,\u00a0a small-car company,\u00a0the designers behind the mouse and a\u00a0magazine for people who give a damn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Currently he is a partner at Collaborative Fund,\u00a0a seed fund that is trying to make the world better, one investment at a time.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll get a chance to hear about his journey, with Q&amp;A and community shout outs afterwards!
