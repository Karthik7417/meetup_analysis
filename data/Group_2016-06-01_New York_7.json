The founding organizer stepped down without naming anyone to takeover. I didn't want to see a group with such an amazing purpose and so much interest just disappear so I have stepped up to be the organizer.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;I have made a change to the name of the group to NJ Women's Business and Leadership Network and let me tell you why. Many of the skills and topics that are absolutely crucial to being a successful entrepreneur are extremely valuable to women with other paths in life as well. I believe that by increasing the variety of women in the group we will also broaden our knowledge, learn more creative and innovative ways to implement what we learn, and have a more robust network of colleagues and friends. This means more opportunities for everyone to learn and grow!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;I made this group a little broader so that whether you have a home-based business or a successful start-up, whether you have a leadership role in the corporate world or are just getting started, or even if you are a stay-at-home mom with a strong presence in a charitable organization my hope is that you can find a sense of community and network here.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;After all I think women in any of those scenarios are in search of the same things: a chance to learn and improve our leadership and management skills and a chance to interact with, and most importantly learn from, like-minded women. As the self-aware women that I know we all are, I think we all accept that we don't know what we don't know and a great way to fill in those gaps in knowledge is to expose yourself to something (or someone) new!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;I hope you are all as excited about the future of this group as I am.

Through the group process, you will learn to give yourself permission to express yourself fully in all aspects of your Self, to recognize the good and the healthy, while unraveling the strategies and contexts that keep you stuck. We will partner to uncover that which has been shunned or pushed to the dark and forgotten--those destructive behaviors and unfulfilling relationships that limit your emotional growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>My way of being and working with you is warm, respectful, authentic, honest and compassionate. As a group facilitator, my role is to facilitate and move the conversation forward, while attending to the group process and your present moment awareness. The power of group lies in the unique opportunity to receive multiple perspectives, support, encouragement and feedback from other individuals in safe and confidential environment. These interpersonal interactions can provide group members an opportunity to deepen their level of self-awareness and to learn how they relate to others. The Relationship Circle can be a safe and supportive place to experiment with new ideas and ways of being. Together we work at creating a space where you can experience profound change rather than merely talking about change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span>Group Format:<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>The format of the groups will often be topic-driven (structured) as a jumping off point to create powerful conversation.&nbsp; Other times, group members are encouraged to bring in their relationship issues.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>\u00b7<\/span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>The group size is limited to 14-16 people<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>\u00b7<\/span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>This is an open group for men and women<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE:&nbsp;<span>For those who are interested in deeper work, there is a closed-group that will be running on Wednesday, April 16th, 2014.

I want to share my story and experiences with &nbsp;other women out there who are or could be in the same situation I once was in. My goal is to support and help as many women as I possible &nbsp;can If I only reach one woman to understand the dangers of an abusive relationship and from the devastating &nbsp;effects abuse of any form can have on a woman ( I myself know this only too well) then I have accomplished something worth doing. Abuse ladies comes in many forms abusive men are also known as sociopath- narcissistic- antisocial sociopath) antisocial sociopath is what my ex- husband was actually diagnosed with when he was sent to prison. I would like everyone to bear in mind that regardless of what problems these men may have there is no excuse in anyway shape or form for their behavior or to abuse or mistreat another person in fact statistics have shown these men know exactly what they are doing and to who they are doing it to also that they are not capable of empathy or remorse statistics have proven that a very small- very small I empathize here percentage of abusive men change please keep that in mind.I have been through extensive therapy and still attend therapy once a week I have researched and read numerous books on abuse all kinds of abuse I have attended Many domestic violence meetings and groups I was asked to speak at a domestic violence benefit back in 2012- I will post my speech on the site- I do this because one it helps me to understand things on a different level regarding domestic violence , myself and the behavior of the abuser . SECOND it gives me the information and knowledge I need to help myself and other woman &nbsp;before it could possibly be to late. I had another group located in Brooklyn before starting this one that actually went extremely well but I had gotten sick for a little while and &nbsp;had to closed that group because I wasn't well enough to keep up with it. I have a GREAT amount of compassion-understanding and an anonymous passion to reach as many women as I can to help them realize abusive relationships are not normal or healthy in fact they are extremely dangerous not only just on a physical level but financially -Verbally and can be extremely emotionally devastating to the point where our self-worth and self-esteem are almost nonexistent everything I write here is because I have been through it and without support and the right people in your life it can be extremely hard to overcome it's sad to say but the truth is some people may never overcome what &nbsp;they have been through but with support and the right people and knowledge we can heal. it has &nbsp;been my experience that only people who have been through the same situation can really feel and understand our pain I remember I had two women in my last group one woman said to me he doesn't really abuse me he just hits me once in a while and calls me names another woman said and this is the woman I asked to leave my group said that it was okay for men to behave verbally or abusive because that's how she grew up and what her parents did and that it was excepted back then I do not agree with this at all please don't get me wrong I was not being mean or un sympathetic the woman I'm talking about is actually a friend of mine I tried to make her realize that this is not acceptable and that no one has the right to mistreat anyone then or now so I simply said if this is your beliefs &nbsp;on this matter that it would be better if she didn't attend the group just for the fact that I did not want any woman or anyone to think that abuse is acceptable or okay She actually understood we are still friends but unfortunately she thinks it's okay for men as she puts it to get a little crazy and I believe for this reason she is not able to have a healthy stable relationships for long periods at a time I will always be there for her and love her very much I have faith that one day she will get it right I also might add that at times I let her know that she is welcome to attend the group to listen and learn. My story goes something like this and I'm sure a lot of women can relate I met my ex-husband Jeffrey in early 2009 Jeffrey was loving understanding very giving very caring told me all the things I wanted to hear At the time when I met Jeffrey I had just recently come out of a relationship it wasn't an abusive relationship just that the gentleman I was with who was actually a very &nbsp;good man had gotten caught up with drugs wouldn't get help and I didn't want to be in that type of relationship that type of relationship isnt &nbsp;abusive but it is however dysfunctional in my opinion okay back to Jeffrey it was only a few months before Jeffrey's true colors came through it &nbsp;kind of started very saddle almost as if you wouldn't notice &nbsp;it But I saw it from the start. at that time because of my own insecurities and self-esteem I chose to ignore it and pretend nothing was wrong &nbsp;so what started &nbsp;with verbal abuse neglect disrespect eventually ended in physical abuse I was verbally abused almost on a daily basis with some of the most cruel hurtful words I have ever heard if Jeffrey didn't get what he wanted or if you didn't act the way he thought you should be he became very angry and aggressive I should mention I hid Jeffrey and our relationship from my family for most of the time we were together why you might say? for one because I knew he was an abusive man But at that time I believed I loved him and didn't want anyone to say why don't you leave him get away from him I had so many insecurities and my self-esteem you couldn't pick up with &nbsp;a shovel that in my head I thought it was better to be with him because my mind was telling me who would want you Antoinette as time went on the abuse got worse and worse verbal abuse constantly physical abuse to the point of a blackeye a dislocated shoulder many &nbsp;bruises &nbsp;lifting the mattress in the air while I was sleeping and throwing me off &nbsp;the bed hitting the dresser against the wall which has now cost me several herniated disc standing and arguing with him one day he grabbed my feet well my ankles which caused me to land on my back and hit my head and causing more injuries now to my neck I remember for some reason a particular time that stands out in my head Jeffrey and I had just gotten married it was only two weeks after our marriage we had a huge fight and I threw him out and he went to stay in a hotel I found out months later he actually had an affair with a prostitute in that hotel I didn't know that at the time I took him back I let him came back home and &nbsp;and he wanted to have sex So we had sex in the Middle of sex he decided to grab me and push me half out the window naked calling me a whore telling me I like it let everyone see the whore u are this was Jeffrey's way of humiliating me and getting back at me for throwing him out Jeffrey as most abusive man are extremely manipulating not to mention they can be very charming and that is how they are able to &nbsp;get you to want them even more manipulating abusive men tend to look for vulnerable weak insecure unstable &nbsp;women they are on the prowl for easy prey I'm sure some of you must be saying why would I put up with something like this but ladies and I'm sure a lot of you know there are many many reasons why women put up with abuse And one of the reasons for this &nbsp;group is to bring out the points of why we put up with abuse recognize them understand the reasoning and put ourselves on a journey to healing there is more to my story and yes with a happy ending that I will talk about in our group meetings also this doesn't have to only be in groups one on one meetings are also available for women who are not comfortable yet talking in groups. For me the first step in &nbsp;recognizing abuse was to admit there was abuse and to believe that I am worth more then to be mistreated &nbsp;and to reach out for &nbsp;help and support&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>

The Skipping Club Summer 2014 season is May 29 - Aug 7, a full summer of themed skipping adventures. Right now, it's training season at Little Skips in Bushwick, where you can skip and learn all about it April 10, 17, 24, and 26 at 2PM. For New Yorkers in the know, Skipping Club is a great source of fitness, a dose of joy in our week, a visceral way to get outside our comfort zones, an excuse to dress up, and a way to journey back to our youth. It's also a unique way to see the city and a faaaaaahbulous social outing. Every Thursday at 2 - and select happy hours, nights and weekends, Skipping Club skips a one-mile route, with intervals, exploring a new neighborhood around the city. From the Upper West Side and Central Park to Williamsburg, dive into a new theme - sartorially and spiritually. Enjoy curated music, improv-style games, meditations, urban adventures and a delicious hand-picked food and drink spot. Come skip, rediscover your playful innocence, paint the streets with joy, emit waves of positivity into the universe, and find your rhythm! I invite you to step into my imagination... and yours.","lon":-73.9300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":65656202,"name":"Michelle Joni Lapidos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/highres_192131052.jpeg","photo_id":192131052,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/member_192131052.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/2\/c\/thumb_192131052.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Michelle Joni's Skipping Club","id":13957042,"state":"NY","urlname":"Michelle-Jonis-Skipping-Club","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Skippers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397737378000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"improv","name":"Improv","id":53513},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"people-that-like-stand-up-comedy","name":"people that like stand up comedy","id":422202},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002},{"urlkey":"comedy-show","name":"comedy show","id":424022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/comedycraver\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>The Comedy Craver Meetup is open to lovers of comedy.

We hold our events in different places in central NJ, so don't pay too much attention to the listed group location!<\/p>\n<p>We focus on a form of energy healing known as Reiki. What is it? It is better understood when broken apart. Rei is universal Wisdom and Ki is life force energy. When put together, Reiki means Universal Life Force Energy that is Divinely Guided. What Divine means is completely up to you: Reiki carries no dogma and requires no specific way of thinking, so it is compatible with any religion or set of beliefs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When people practice Reiki, they put aside their ego and thoughts to act as a simple channel for the energy, the same way a wire allows electricity to pass through. Anyone and everyone can benefit from Reiki, as the energy helps regulate blocked or deficient Ki. Your Ki is affected by your state of mind and your day-to-day life, and energetic disturbances eventually cause illness and dis-ease. \u00a0Reiki practitioners help restore your body, mind, and spirit to the natural state of pure perfection.<\/p>\n<p>Reiki is a way to purify the holistic self, reduce stress and anxiety, and ultimately further one on his or her spiritual journey. Each person takes something different away from a session, because Reiki is always for your best and highest good. If you've never received it before, we encourage you to come to a share so that you can have a taste and see what it's all about.<\/p>\n<p>Come join other beautiful souls as we share, explore and unfold the magic of Reiki!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/njreikilove<\/a><br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74.4300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/highres_353782452.jpeg","photo_id":353782452,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/600_353782452.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_353782452.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":123272232,"name":"Lindsay Barber","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/highres_241727166.jpeg","photo_id":241727166,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/member_241727166.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/3\/e\/thumb_241727166.jpeg"}},"members":158,"name":"Reiki Love New Jersey","id":13963922,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Reiki-Love-NJ","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Beautiful Souls"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1397760476000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poker","name":"Poker","id":254},{"urlkey":"texas-hold-em","name":"Texas Hold 'em","id":16947},{"urlkey":"poker-cash-games","name":"Poker Cash Games","id":32260},{"urlkey":"texas-holdem-poker","name":"Texas Holdem Poker","id":41406},{"urlkey":"poker-night","name":"Poker Night","id":41407},{"urlkey":"private-poker-club","name":"Private Poker Club","id":42491},{"urlkey":"poker-home-games","name":"Poker Home Games","id":50791}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/East-Village-Donkey-1-2-Poker-NLHE-Cash-Game\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>We call this a home game because it's played out of my living room (where I live with my girlfriend).

By nature, for the past few years anyway, I've turned into a real worrier and pessimist, due to a few downturns in my life, so I thought I could use this class. Well, there was another bump in the road in my family life (my daughter lost her job) but instead of my typical hand-wringing, poor us, reaction, I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement for her...automatically, without trying. I feel I've been re-wired by Mark's weekly guidance and my subsequent daily practice. Would I say it's a miracle? \u00a0I think so...... The point is, it works. \u00a0Come join us and see for yourself. \u00a0Thank you, Mark.

Primordial voice is given to every single human. It is and intelligence on its own, the most amazing inbuilt guidance system, it is a healer within. PV is active in children up to the age of 3 years and can be activated during sexual experience, a serious illness or a form of mourning which is actually a healing vibration. <br> Through Primordial Voice Technique you can reach untapped phenomenal abilities everyone possesses. These abilities are often hidden deep inside and accessed through the power of one\u2019s own Primordial Voice, a very powerful teaching allowing to re-recognize one\u2019s own strength.<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice teaches you to reach forgotten self confidence and live in agreement with your own true self. A grown-up person has 2 voices: a \u201cthinking\u201d voice which is active, and primordial one which is usually dormant. A \u201cthinking\u201d voice is a voice connected to the intellect that communicates the data registered by the brain. The vocal cords and muscles are used to produce a thinking brain. Primordial Voice is connected to the \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cheart\u201d , it is produced by trachea and smooth muscles that are connected to our subconscious mind. It communicates our inner wisdom, our inner guidance; it says, \u201cI lead you, I guide you\u201d. <br> Knowing your Primordial Voice and recognizing it is the most powerful tool to the secret of life, making the right choices, committing to the right situations, and interacting with the right people. Remember, you have spent many years trying to change yourself just to fit the general standards, to acquire qualities that are not yours and do not reflect your unique nature. The question is whether or not you have succeeded? And does your success set you free?<\/p>\n<p>Primordial Voice is not about changing or improving: it is about KNOWING yourself and living in accordance with your TRUE SELF. Knowing who you are is the key to your freedom. The PV program is a course consisting of several stages of special exercises, breath work and energy work, and although it takes time to master this technique, even one hour of this work will give you the experience of what it is like to be your own master.

It is reassuring beyond words to know this truth - which we demonstrate through Mediumship (communications with spirit). Our mission is to share the light, love and knowledge of spirit without divisive dogma or restrictive rules. We create an open and loving atmosphere within the Church; one which welcomes people from all faiths and denominations.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A MEDIUM AND\/OR MEDIUMSHIP?<\/b><br>\n\n A medium is a person who is sensitive to the thought and energy vibrations which come to us from those in Spirit. A medium can attune to the Spirit people, and is able to describe them and relate their thoughts, emotions, memories, and messages. Mediumship is a natural gift of the Spirit and has many purposes: it brings comfort to the bereaved; it offers spiritual nourishment for the soul; it becomes a vehicle for God\u2019s Healing Spirit; and it demonstrates the potential of the individual to break through self-imposed limitation and, thus, become part of a Greater Whole.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL HEALING<\/b>?<br>\n\n An important part of of the Spiritualist experience is healing. Healers are simply channels for healing; the source of all healing is God. Our trained and designated healers direct healing light and energy according to each individual's needs. At every Sunday service during a period of meditation, we offer the opportunity to sit in one of our healing chairs for hands-on energy healing (given by a touch on your shoulders).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>IS SPIRITUALISM A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION?<\/b><br>\n\n Spiritualism is the vehicle through which all religions have been given birth. We embrace the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth. We consider Jesus a great prophet, medium and healer. His connection with the Divine was so strong that one could consider him as God's Presence on Earth. Was he the only such manifestation of God's Love and Grace? No. During times of spiritual crisis, God sends messengers of the Word to help guide us; Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna and Mohammed, to name a few. One can be Christian and a Spiritualist; one can be Jewish and a Spiritualist; one can be Buddhist and a Spiritualist; etc.<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n SUNDAY SERVICE:<\/b><br>\n\n The highlight of our Church week is Sunday worship. Our worship service integrates music, prayer, healing, meditation, inspiration and Spirit communication into the beautiful and unique experience of Spiritualist worship. Each week our church invites a guest minister. Sunday service begins at 11:00 AM and ends at approximately 12:15 PM. You are cordially invited to join us in the Church Hall for coffee, refreshments and fellowship following the service. (Doors Open at 10:30 AM for Silent Prayer and Meditation).<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>The Typical Order of Service:<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Opening Song and Prayer<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Declaration of Principles<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Sermon \/ Sharing<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Healing Prayer and Meditation<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Laying-on-of-Hands Healing<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Offering<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Announcements<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Hymn<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Spirit Greetings (Mediumship)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Closing Song: \"Let There Be Peace on Earth\"<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>WORKSHOPS:<\/b><br>\n\n Our guest ministers and other spiritual practitioners provide workshops on various subjects relating to Spirituality, Mediumship Development, Psychic Development, Healing and much more. All are welcome to join - newcomers are encouraged! There is a suggested donation listed for each event (however, we do not turn anyone away for inability to pay the full amount). Many of our classes are held on weekdays in the evening, and on Sunday after worship. Please check our calendar of events and\/or web site (which is updated more frequently) for additional information regarding exact dates and times.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <b>PSYCHIC \/ SPIRITUAL FAIR:<\/b><br>\n\n Albertson Memorial Church holds a Spiritual Fair on the first Saturday of every month from 12pm-5pm.

Sounds good so far. Almost two thousand years earlier another also very sharp Greek dude named Aristotle wrote that not only is happiness the greatest good, it\u2019s the only end in life, everything else being just a means. Okay, that makes sense too.<\/p>\n<p>This group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions:<\/p>\n<p>1.

Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n Here's some background on the research our group is based on:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free. (Note: Although these classic articles are somewhat dated, decades of research on happiness reveal that findings on happiness tend to be extremely stable over time.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.335.9655&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change<br>\n\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By S Lyubomirsky, KM Sheldon and D Schkade, 2005.\u00a0 21 pages<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Kesebir-Diener_2008.pdf\">In Pursuit of Happiness: Empirical Answers to Philosophical Questions<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By P Kesebir and E Diener, 2008. 9 pages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/internal.psychology.illinois.edu\/%7Eediener\/Documents\/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf\">Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress<\/a> By E Diener, EM Suh, RE Lucas and HL Smith, 1999. 27 pages<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.75,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/highres_358264572.jpeg","photo_id":358264572,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/600_358264572.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/d\/c\/thumb_358264572.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3373400,"name":"George","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/b\/highres_252300555.jpeg","photo_id":252300555,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/b\/member_252300555.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/b\/thumb_252300555.jpeg"}},"members":859,"name":"The Happiness and Goodness Club - White Plains","id":14180342,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Happiness-and-Goodness-Club-White-Plains","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Very Happy People"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1398869619000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"stop-renting-and-buy-your-own-home","name":"Stop Renting and Buy Your Own Home","id":34016},{"urlkey":"first-time-home-buyers-workshop","name":"First Time Home Buyer's Workshop","id":34018},{"urlkey":"home-buying-process-step-by-step","name":"Home Buying Process Step by Step","id":42522},{"urlkey":"how-do-i-begin-my-home-search","name":"How Do I Begin My Home Search","id":66477},{"urlkey":"smart-home-buyer","name":"Smart Home Buyer","id":70601},{"urlkey":"first-time-homebuyers","name":"First time homebuyers","id":736072}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-NY-House-Buyers-to-meet-in-Manhattan-Sat-5-31\/","rating":0,"description":"Expanding family?

I formed this walk group for people who are new to the area (or old) or even considering moving into an area and would like to explore the different cool parts of the towns and cities along the Hudson. I always feel that people move into a specific area only after having probably zipped through the neighborhood sitting in a car. Well yes, one does get a \"vague\" idea of the place but do you really get to enjoy it? Then do you come back again and again to take in the flavour? Maybe, maybe not. So as a way to give back to the society I decided to form this meetup. Usually the walks will not be over bearing or long. However for your &amp; everyone else's enjoyment, you have to be physically fit to be walking and being on foot for at least an hour or more. To keep it interesting we can end the walk in an interesting place to eat or drink from time to time. Every meetup we'll be exploring different areas for Jersey City, Hoboken and West NewYork. If you want more cities to be added feel free to get in touch with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/6\/0\/600_358735392.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px\"><\/p>\n<p>*Members should understand and agree that they will be obligated to pay the bill for the food or drinks they have incase the meetup ends at a place of food or drinks.<\/p>\n<p>*As a member of this group you are not allowed to solicit other members for your products, business or services.

Together, we can practice staying grounded in the present moment by stopping, focusing on our breathing, and observing our thoughts and feelings without getting lost in them. By sitting and walking in this way, we can gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By continually practicing with the support of community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened and our concentration deepens. There will be guided and silent sittings and a period of walking meditation, along with a reading and time to share and practice mindful speech and listening. The practice is influenced by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, Pema Chodron, and the teachers of the Insight Meditation tradition. There is a suggested donation of $10.

The UX Debate Club uses an Oxford-Style debate format to encourage everyone to participate while exchanging ideas, banishing dogma and having fun.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/highres_403281622.jpeg","photo_id":403281622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/600_403281622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/4\/7\/6\/thumb_403281622.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13234574,"name":"Michael Calleia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/7\/4\/highres_58525972.jpeg","photo_id":58525972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/7\/4\/member_58525972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/5\/7\/4\/thumb_58525972.jpeg"}},"members":174,"name":"UX Debate Club","id":14611582,"state":"NY","urlname":"UX-Debate-Club","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Debaters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1400839029000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newcareer","name":"New Career","id":2790},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"job-interviews-move-up-get-a-job-preparation","name":"Job Interview Prep","id":18024},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"career-coaching","name":"Career Coaching","id":20251},{"urlkey":"networking-for-job-seekers","name":"Networking for Job Seekers","id":21836},{"urlkey":"technology-professionals","name":"Technology Professionals","id":22203},{"urlkey":"information-technology-in-business","name":"Information Technology in Business","id":22239},{"urlkey":"career-advancement","name":"Career Advancement","id":26946}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ITCareersNY\/","rating":4.33,"description":"<p>IT Careers &amp; Our Career Advancement Team<\/p>\n<p>We provide individual mentoring services and career advancement strategies to IT professionals.

This Meetup was created in the hopes of having one central listing for all NYC history related events in the city. &nbsp; In a way this is more of calendar than it is a Meetup, but if people enjoy this resource then I would be down to create more social types of event. &nbsp;And if you do plan to go to an event feel free to RSVP and invite people for pre- or post- event hanging out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also if you enjoy this resource and want to help out please feel free to contact me. &nbsp;I want to add events from as many sources as possible, but it might be a bit much for one man.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Also a few disclaimers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp; One, I do own a sightseeing company for full disclosure, but I will mention which if any events are from my company. &nbsp;I don't think I'll list many at all or for a while.<\/span> <br> <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Two, I will provide links to all the venues with the event posting. &nbsp;If you want to confirm that you will be able to join an event check there to see if it's been canceled or is sold out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Three, event hosts in this Meetup means that they manage the posting, not that they will actually be attending the event (unless they say otherwise.) &nbsp;If you are attending the event and want to let people know RSVP. &nbsp;If you would like to do something before or after the event let people know in the comments.<span>&nbsp; With that having been said here's the criteria for the events I list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 1) &nbsp;Must be New York City related in some way. &nbsp;Related being the key word. &nbsp;If there's a talk on the Dutch colonial period, but not specifically on New York I might throw it in the mix.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 2) &nbsp;Must be history related in some significant way. &nbsp;Doesn't have to be all history based to qualify. &nbsp;A tour of the High Line that talks about the future plans of the site in addition to it's history is fine. &nbsp;An event that only talks about present or future events will not be added.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the purposes of this Meetup I will say it will have to deal with events at least 20 years old to be \"historical\".<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; 3) &nbsp;Daily or weekly events will not (for the time being) be added to this Meetup to prevent clutter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Enjoy and please feel free to give me feedback.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; SOME PLACES WE CHECK FOR EVENTS:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; BROOKLYN BRAINERY \/ BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY \/ BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY \/ MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK \/ NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF PARKS &amp;

This is a group where you can keep updated on classes, workshops and special events offered by the school.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Old Yang Style is the style of T'ai Chi Ch'uan developed originally by its founder, Yang Lu-ch\u2019an, in the 19th century; a style that has its roots in Wudang Chuan and Dim-Mak, which confers on it its Medical\/Martial nature; consequentially leading to a better communion with the Universe, as it was originally intended.<\/p>\n<p>Even though this is the original system, nowadays what is widely known as Yang Style T'ai Chi Ch'uan is the style developed by one of Lu-Ch'an's grandsons, Yang Chengfu; a man who did an extraordinary job by simplifying the form and training methods to make them more accessible for everybody, disregarding their current health condition or age. Yet, its medical\/martial origin was gradually stripped from it by subsequent generations of practitioners, rendering a form that is definitely better than not doing any type of physical activity, yet not able to deliver all its unmeasurable potential.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a difference must be made between this worldwide known style, and the original style that was passed down by Lu-Ch'an's other grandson, Yang Shou-hou, and preserved by the World Taiji Boxing Association, that will enable the serious practitioner to take advantage of all the benefits offered by the work of geniuses. The training takes the practitioner through self-healing, martial and, eventually, medical levels of apprenticeship and practice.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A more detailed primary training is as follows:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>-Self Healing and Martial Qi Gong\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>-Yang Lu-ch'an's Form<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0-Tui Shou (Push Hands)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>-Small San Sau (Self Defense form)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Feel free to come and train in any of our classes, where you will find an environment where friendship, cordiality, respect and lots of hard work is the rule.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/c\/2\/highres_371015522.jpeg","photo_id":371015522,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/c\/2\/600_371015522.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/a\/c\/2\/thumb_371015522.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":149581922,"name":"Jose I.

You climb inside and discover that the cockpit has been designed to mimic the cockpit of your 1910 biplane! You receive a DRAMATIC upgrade to your aircraft without having to learn how to fly from scratch.

Hip hop rivals pop and country music as the most lucrative music forms in world. Spanish language radio and TV ratings out-perform its English language counterparts in many of the largest media markets. The NFL, MLB and NBA each have various ethnic and racial groups highly represented on the field or on the court.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the staffs and front offices of these venues, teams and promoters don't always reflect the diversity on the field, on the stage or in the stands. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tidesport.org\/RGRC\/2013\/2013_NBA_RGRC.pdf\">The Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Sport reports<\/a> that the NBA's player population stands at 81 percent men of color yet only 7 percent of team CEOs are Black, Latino or Asian American. In music, three of the top-grossing concert artists are Jay Z, Beyonce and Bruno Mars but what percentage of the arena's sales and marketing staff are people of color? When working at a venue or with a promoter, how do you connect with industry colleagues and other resources to help you market and sell more tickets to diversity markets?<\/p>\n<p>Our group seeks to to do three, fun things to help:<\/p>\n<p>1. Network! We have a network of sports and entertainment sales, marketing, PR and venue operations professionals that would love to get together and network and make new connections. We also know lots of people would like to explore getting a job with a sports team or a art house venue but don't have the knowledge or the connections. We could be a fun group to learn more and make those connections.<\/p>\n<p>2. Attend Live Events &amp; Meet Insiders. We also look to schedule outings where we can to see a great show or sporting event but get something a little extra - like see a show then have an artist meet-and-greet or attend a sporting event and then meet current team employees to learn about the industry. There are lots of great opportunities for these kinds of outings throughout the NY\/NJ region.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u00a03. Have Fun! That's why we don't sell or market something boring, after all :) We hope you can join us for some fun outings with like-minded professionals.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/highres_384661722.jpeg","photo_id":384661722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/600_384661722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/a\/thumb_384661722.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3843797,"name":"Michael Collazo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/3\/e\/highres_147058942.jpeg","photo_id":147058942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/3\/e\/member_147058942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/3\/e\/thumb_147058942.jpeg"}},"members":29,"name":"Dahday's Live Sports & Entertainment Industry Insiders Group","id":14977012,"state":"NY","urlname":"Dahdays-Live-Sports-Entertainment-Industry-Insiders-Group","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Sports & Entertainment Insiders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1402333158000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"summer","name":"Summer","id":98653}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Summer\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for cool people who like it hot (and hot people who like the cool!), in their 20s and 30s looking to meet new friends.

This is a mastermind group for people interested in the art and business of fiction writing. Our motto - \"when one boat rises, all boats rise.\"\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Below is some basic information. Please visit the various other sections of our site for more details.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Our Goals<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Ours is not your typical meetup group. Our primary focus is to help writers at all levels of development, to evolve and improve both their skills as a writer, and their knowledge\u00a0 and abilities in aspects of self-publishing. We do this by pursuing four goals.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 1 - To Sharpen our writing skills through discussions of craft and technique, by performing fun group writing exercises, and by critiquing each others work in a structured format.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 2 - To add to our knowledge of the\u00a0 craft and business of writing, through the selected readings of some of the best books on the market. Each month our group will read one book from a list of selected titles. What we learn from each book, will be the basis of our discussions as we share ideas and experiences, building on the material we've read.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 3 - To explore the rapidly grow opportunities arising from the world of self-publishing through discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas. Building mailing lists, construction of marketing funnels, building product catalogs, calls to action, e-book pricing, hybrid publishing, paper print vs digital - all these subjects and more will be examined.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Goal 4 - To network with like minded writers, to share ideas, to encourage, to mastermind. Writing can be a lonely pursuit. It often helps to get together with those walking the same path as you. As the group grows and gets comfortable with each other, additional gatherings may be arranged, from an occasional get together over a few drinks or a cup of coffee, to going as a group to a writers conference (RWA 2015!).<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Who This Group Is For<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>This group is primarily for story tellers, writers of fiction and\u00a0memoirs. While all writers within these categories are welcome, it should be noted that this group will be especially geared towards the entrepreneur, the person(s) looking to write professionally, or at least make some supplemental income. Self-publishing will also have a strong focus, though we will also touch on traditional and hybrid publishing during the course of our journey. Existing professional writers are more than welcome (we will worship you accordingly), as are beginners and everyone in-between who have finally decided its time to pursue that dream.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The group is length agnostic - short stories, novella's, novels, serials, all are welcome. The group is also genre agnostic. Whether your writing westerns, science fiction or romance, the crafting of story shares the same techniques and difficulties.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Which is Why ...<\/b><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Writing groups are notoriously tough to start and maintain on meetup.com. With your help, we're going to be different. While we appreciate you joining our little \"kickass\" group, \"just joining\" and three dollars will help pay for coffee. SHOWING UP to a meeting is what really counts! Come to a meeting. You will have fun, sharpen your skills and learn tons of valuable stuff.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><i>Lesson two - start with a call to action, then end with a call to action.

Socionics is similar to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, only a lot more advanced to better explain personality type and inter-type relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Socionics is a personality typology developed in the 1970s and '80s by the Lithuanian researcher Dr. Au\u0161ra Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. Socionics is based on Jung's personality type theory, Freud's theory of the conscious and unconscious, and Antoni Kepinski's theory of information metabolism. Since its inception, it has been developed by a variety of Russian researchers like Gulenko. The name \"socionics\" is derived from the word \"society\", because Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 believed that each personality type has a distinct purpose in society, which can be described and explained by Socionics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most interesting part of Socionics is dedicated to the intertype relations research. Each personality type, according to Socionics, has a specific core relationship to each other personality type. The theory suggests that some personality types are more and the others are less psychologically compatible based on their personality differences. Socionics dating grows in popularity day by day as more people learn about this intertype relationship theory and gain valuable insights in their private and working relationships. This group is for people to learn and discuss Socionics for the purpose of self-typing and self-discovery, to find the right partner whether it is for a short or long term relationship, to improve their current social, familial, and romantic relationships, and most definitely to connect to other people who are interested in examining their lives and relationships through the Socionical lens.<\/p>\n<p>With this group, you'll be able to find out your Socionics type and learn more about your strengths, values and attitudes towards the world around you, and how you interact with those of different types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Socionics, check out our&nbsp;<a

Companies should give talks roughly once a year.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Target talks towards technical audience.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Talk in depth. We don't need yet another \"how we deploy\" or \"how we used Angular to...\" spiel.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Of course you're hiring. No need to mention it, and no poaching either.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>We're currently collecting members and will plan out the next few months of talks. Stay tuned for the first meetup!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/8\/c\/highres_382412652.jpeg","photo_id":382412652,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/8\/c\/600_382412652.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/8\/c\/thumb_382412652.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":8466542,"name":"Wes Chow","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/2\/e\/highres_7054862.jpeg","photo_id":7054862,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/2\/e\/member_7054862.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/8\/2\/e\/thumb_7054862.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"I Got 99 Issues But This Pull Request Ain't One","id":15459542,"state":"NY","urlname":"I-Got-99-Issues-But-This-Pull-Request-Aint-One","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"typists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1404331220000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"leisure-walking","name":"Leisure Walking","id":15834},{"urlkey":"park","name":"Park","id":16782},{"urlkey":"picnics","name":"Picnics","id":17067},{"urlkey":"highline","name":"Highline","id":17730},{"urlkey":"nature-walks","name":"Nature Walks","id":19666},{"urlkey":"parks-recreation","name":"Parks & Recreation","id":22109},{"urlkey":"nature-appreciation","name":"Nature Appreciation","id":28591},{"urlkey":"central-park","name":"Central Park","id":29359},{"urlkey":"fort-tryon-park","name":"Fort Tryon Park","id":146110},{"urlkey":"riverside-park","name":"Riverside Park","id":146111},{"urlkey":"nature","name":"Nature","id":197471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Parks-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"We love spending time in Manhattan's dizzying array of fantastic parks.

This is a group for any working mom interested in meeting other working moms who find that really difficult balance between working full time and taking care of your little one(s). No one is perfect and we all can sure use the support! I'm sure some days you just want to quit and give up or at least start crying because it can all be so challenging at times. I started this group because I've met so many stay at home moms but not so many working moms in Astoria. All neighborhoods are welcome of course!

VeloPaddler's are dedicated to balanced participation in full body endurance cadence strokes. Equal amounts of spinning a Bicycle combined with equal amounts of Stand Up Paddling on water. Proficiency with both strokes combined into one day or work out is exhilarating and sustainable not to mention a complete full body fitness program that will delight your summer, late spring and early fall. VeloPaddler's use any bike and a light weight trailer plus an Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board. The cycling route is planned with adequate time given for the paddling and return cycle trip. Cycling Lycra with a little additional Kayak clothing is all you need as far as clothing. A water sock or moccasin is recommended. VeloPaddling is new and we aim to be very helpful to beginners. Cyclist or Paddler or neither. Come learn and try in tiny successful fun bits. Most of all we want you to experience the full door to door round trip motor experience. We came from 11 years of USA Cycle road racing 20 years of NYC Club Rising and now 3 years of SUP paddling on all local water ways. We provide certified instruction in both activities.

You can also bring books to swap if you're running out of space.<\/p>\n<p>We also now have a Brooklyn chapter, which you can join at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Brooklyn\/\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Brooklyn\/<\/a>.<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/highres_390268202.jpeg","photo_id":390268202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/600_390268202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_390268202.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6828801,"name":"Karina Mikhli","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/0\/d\/highres_256699213.jpeg","photo_id":256699213,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/0\/d\/member_256699213.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/0\/d\/thumb_256699213.jpeg"}},"members":120,"name":"Choose Your Own Reading Adventure: Manhattan Book Discussion","id":15932602,"state":"NY","urlname":"Choose-Your-Own-Reading-Adventure-Manhattan","category":{"name":"book clubs","id":18,"shortname":"book-clubs"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406165649000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"daytraders","name":"Day Traders","id":2088},{"urlkey":"ibd","name":"Investor's Business Daily","id":2545},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"forextrading","name":"Forex Trading","id":8431},{"urlkey":"futures-trading","name":"Futures Trading","id":16268},{"urlkey":"currency-trading","name":"Currency Trading","id":16269},{"urlkey":"technical-analysis","name":"Technical Analysis","id":17232},{"urlkey":"stock-trading","name":"Stock Trading","id":17234},{"urlkey":"stock-market","name":"Stock Market","id":19267},{"urlkey":"careers-in-forex-trading","name":"Careers in Forex Trading","id":19381},{"urlkey":"stock-investing","name":"Stock Investing","id":22016},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906},{"urlkey":"fx-trading","name":"FX Trading","id":95411}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyctraders\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>80% of global wealth is owned by 0.8% of the global population.

We organize social skates and get-togethers in the city, trips around the eastern seaboard and farther afield, clinics, seminars, parties and promote skate advocacy. We provide discounts at skating stores, discounted subscriptions to skating magazines, and occasionally give our members free merchandise from our sponsors. For a full list of membership benefits, visit the membership page on our website.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Evening\/Night Skates are a great way to meet people. Our Tuesday Night Skate, New York's longest running night skate, is for more experienced skaters who want to experience all the thrills of skating in and around the five boroughs at night. We also always join the Wednesday Night Skate leaving every Wednesday at 8 pm from Union Square South. This skate is for intermediate skaters who are comfortable skating in traffic (And it's a blast!!!).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day Skates are longer trips, usually half to a full day long, to Coney Island, CT Beaches, Westchester Trails or along the Jersey Palisades (for example), and are for intermediate level skaters. Possible day-long skates might involve hopping aboard a commuter train and heading off to a skating place in nearby Westchester, Long Island or southwestern Connecticut. Our leaders are experienced skaters who have done these routes many times. Benefit from their experience and discover places you otherwise might never have thought about reaching on skates. It's fun and easy!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Skating Trips to other cities are weekend long trips providing the opportunity to skate, party &amp; socialize with hundreds of our skater friends from all around the country (and beyond) in Philadelphia, Boston, Washington DC, Miami and elsewhere. Our own version of this is The Big Apple Roll (BAR), usually the first weekend of August each year.

We advocate for preventive medicine, especially good nutrition, conduct clinical research, and advocate for higher ethical standards in research. Our membership includes 150,000 health care professionals and concerned citizens.\n\nWe encourage higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research:\nWe oppose unethical human experiments. While great strides have been made in eliminating such experiments, problems remain. For example, children are still given synthetic growth hormone in experiments to make them taller, and both children and adults are exposed to unnecessary new drugs which have toxic effects.\n\nWe promote alternatives to animal research and animal testing. We have worked to put a stop to gruesome experiments, such as the military\u2019s cat-shooting studies, DEA narcotics experiments, and monkey self-mutilation projects. \n\nWe also promote nonanimal methods in medical education. Currently, more than three-quarters of all U.S. medical schools have dropped their animal labs for medical students.\n\nThe Physicians Committee has led the way for reforms of federal nutrition policies.  Our clinical research programs are breaking new ground in diabetes, cancer, and other serious conditions.  PCRM\u2019s Cancer Project has provided vital information to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe New Four Food Groups is the Physicians Committee's innovative proposal for a federal nutrition policy that puts a new priority on health.\n\nOur public service announcement series features medical experts on prevention and health.\n\nThe Physicians Committee is a nonprofit 501c3 organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":158713292,"name":"Kate Krone","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/highres_214434042.jpeg","photo_id":214434042,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/member_214434042.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/a\/thumb_214434042.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"PCRM Benefit & Auction with Dr. Neal Barnard in Amagansett","id":16031062,"state":"NY","urlname":"PCRM-Benefit-Auction-with-Dr-Neal-Barnard-in-Amagansett","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"PCRM Supporters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Yonkers","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1406578072000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrapbook","name":"Scrapbooking","id":211},{"urlkey":"jewelry","name":"Jewelry Making","id":746},{"urlkey":"cardmaking","name":"Card Making","id":6669},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"rubber-stamping","name":"Rubber Stamping","id":17350},{"urlkey":"scrapbooking-classes-workshops","name":"Scrapbooking Classes & Workshops","id":52231}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crafty-in-Yonkers\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>A group where locals can meet, mingle and craft.

Laurie Bizzarro, P.C.\u201d representing Plaintiffs in personal injury, construction accidents and Employment Discrimination cases.<\/p>\n<p>GARY SUTO<\/p>\n<p>Gary Suto grew up with Hungarian\/Gypsy Grandparents and was surrounded with Astrology, Palmistry, Cardomancy and Numerology. He would not consider himself a Hereditary Witch, but very close to it. He has been practicing divination for 35 years, and his skills include Tarot, Iching, Numerology, Runes and Palmistry. He is a \u00a0High Priest of Temenos Ophiuchus, a grove of the Minoan Brotherhood; High Priest in NY Coven of Witches, a coven of the Wica Tradition, initiated by Lady Rhea; Founder of NY Gay Men's Open Pagan Circle; Co-creator of NY LGBT Open Pagan Circle; Co-founder of Prometheus Rising, Queer Men's Pagan Festival; Past Instructor at the Pagan Center of NY, Psychic Reader and life coach at Magickal Realms and Catland Bookstore; \u00a0He has given workshops and led rituals at various festivals and NYC locations. Hecate came to him at one of these festivals approximately 13 years ago and has been one of his main Deities ever since. On a mundane level he is a fashion designer and graphic designer. He is putting those skills to use in creating Pagan Clothing and Jewelry as well as a Tarot deck that will incorporate the Iching.<\/p>\n<p>JSTERLING HURLEY<\/p>\n<p>From his early childhood JSterling had a connection to the plants and animals who inhabited the woods surrounding his parent\u2019s farm in central Ohio. He was raised in an agnostic home with no formal spiritual guidance which allowed him to explore his own spiritual path as a young adult.<\/p>\n<p>As an out gay youth he worked against homophobia and charted his way through hostile environments and helped other gay youth through violence, ignorance and hate.<\/p>\n<p>JSterling is a High Priest of the Minoan Fellowship Tradition and is priest of the Minoan Brotherhood. He is a green witch and has used his knowledge of plants, aromatherapy and herbology both in his magickal and mundane life. He strives to provide a venue for the LGBT pagan community to become empowered and to reclaim their place as healers, shamans and guides of the dead.\u00a0 Throughout all his training both formal and informal the constant has been the connection to his patron Goddess, Hekate. For within himself She shines through. From the wisdom of the darkness She shine light. And from the potential locked within us all she provides the key of fullness.<\/p>\n<p>MARIO PABON ANDRACA<\/p>\n<p>\u200e<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mario.a.pabon?hc_location=timeline\">Mario Pab\u00f3n Andraca<\/a> has been a practicing pagan for over fifteen years. After being a solitary practitioner for a few years, Mario joined a Wiccan coven of the Gardnerian tradition called Polyhymnia Coven in New York City. He is now a Third Degree High Priest in this Coven.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, after his first encounter with Hekate, Mario joined Arn Draiocht Fein (ADF), and successfully completed their Dedicants' program. Currently he is pursuing ADF's Clergy Training. Currently he holds the position of Scribe in the New York City Grove \"Inis Ull\".<\/p>\n<p>Mario has also recently joined both the Sorita D'Este's Covenant of Hekate, and Hellenion, a Greek Reconstructionis religious organization. Mario discovered Hekate in the Between the Worlds festival where she came to him and guided him to where he is today. His path is mostly Hellenic in private practice, while still teaching Wicca and leading a coven. Most recently he has been given the responsibility to lead and officiate the central Hekate rituals in the very same festival where she first came to him.<\/p>\n<p>MATTHEW SAWICKI<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Sawicki is a Traditional Witch and lifelong devotee of Hecate. He hails from the mountains of North Eastern Pennsylvania and learned much of his craft and magick from his upbringing there. Matthew has been initiated into three separate traditions of the craft, most notably The New York Wica Tradition where he is a 3rd Degree High Priest, The Minoan Brotherhood and the non-wiccan tradition of The Clan of Tubal Cain out of the UK, which remains his main focus and current tradition. Matthew has been a Priest of Hecate whose public rites have led people to her for over 10 years. Matthew is known for his \"Rites of Crossroads\" rituals at the Between the Worlds Men's Gathering in Ohio that has brought more than 80 men together in her worship. Matthew lives in New York City and looks forward to continuing his work as a priest of Hecate to those who seek her.<\/p>\n<p>ANNA LEWIS<\/p>\n<p>Anna Lewis, a NYC native Witch and Pagan is thrilled to be a part of the magick bringing The Temple of Hecate to light. She is a longtime friend of Lady Rhea, Magickal Realms and the NY Coven of Witches as well as Horn and Cauldron of Rhode Island. She currently lives in Rhode Island where she turns the wheel of the year with her young family, worships Yemaya in the sea by day and Hecate at the crossroads by night.

Join the thousands of Citizens Climate Lobby members who are actually moving Congress toward bold climate solutions that could change everything. <br> CCL will change the way you think about democracy. We're not about marches and protests-- we're about you talking directly to your Senators, Congressmen and their top advisers. If you want to make real change happen, this is an incredibly effective form of advocacy. You will be amazed at how much power you have as an informed and inspired citizen. <br> There are lots of ways you can inform and influence your members of Congress-- through letters, emails, phone calls, newspaper articles, and through live meetings with your Congressman, Senators and their advisers. We'll teach you how to do any or all of the above-- wherever your comfort zone takes you. And we'll inspire you to maximize your effectiveness as an advocate for real climate solutions. <br> Best of all, we have a plan and a solid climate proposal for Congress that's actually gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. It is non-partisan, politically viable, scientifically sound, and economically feasible. Economists say it is the most cost efficient approach. Scientists say it is our best shot at saving the planet. <br> We think New York area citizens deserve a special seat at the table when climate change is being discussed because when it comes to climate impacts and sea-level rise, they have a lot at stake. So we are focused on uniting New York area &nbsp;citizens this year. We already have established local CCL chapters in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens\/Nassau, Staten Island, Long Island, Westchester, and Columbia counties in NY, as well as Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Red Hook, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, NY, in Fairfield County in Connecticut, and in Central New Jersey. <br> Join us for an introductory conference call or New York Area Local meeting near you! <br> Website info: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.CitizensClimateLobby.com<\/a> <br> What does climate scientist Dr. James Hansen say about CCL?\"Most impressive is the work of the Citizens Climate Lobby, a relatively new, fast-growing, nonpartisan, nonprofit group with [193] chapters across the United States and Canada.

Contact me for details.<\/p> \n<p>Hi and welcome to my meetup for outdoor personal group fitness training. This group is open to anyone who is interested in improving their fitness, losing weight, getting stronger and becoming more flexible. My classes are primarily focused on quality, not quantity meaning I'm looking for proper form and technique while using full range of motion. Each exercise circuit is timed to ensure everyone goes at their own pace. I also use progression and regression methods based on fitness levels to ensure you are getting to most out your workout.

Rather, I like to call it personal group training because its intimate in size and I can give the small groups of 10 or less individualized attention.

If you wish to engage hard, communicate with your partner beforehand so you both are on the same page.

It is our intention to be inclusive in honoring the different views of those who sincerely intend to minimize the suffering of animals.<\/p>\n<p>You are welcome to attend a variety of events when you join the DVA New York Chapter meetup.\u00a0 In addition to this group we invite you to support our efforts by visiting the website:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/dharmavoicesforanimals.org\/\">http:\/\/dharmavoicesforanimals.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>May all living beings be happy and free!<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Our Leadership Team:<\/p>\n<p>Bob Isaacson is the President of Dharma Voices for Animals.\u00a0 He\u00a0has practiced the\u00a0Dharma for nineteen years in the Vipassana\/Theravada tradition, and taught numerous classes and retreats.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bob is also a former human rights and civil rights attorney.\u00a0 He enjoys hiking, biking, swimming, and world travel.<\/p>\n<p>Kamil Ghoshal is the DVA New York Chapter Leader and dedicated Eight-Precept (a\u1e6d\u1e6dha-s\u012bla) Therav\u0101din disciple (up\u0101saka) at the Original Buddhism Society.\u00a0 He is an aspiring Buddhist scholar with background in Western Philosophy.\u00a0 Kamil's mission outside of DVA is to help restore the original presectarian Teachings of the historical Buddha, Siddh\u0101ttha Gotama.\u00a0 He is also a mountaineer and traditional Chinese kung-fu practitioner.<\/p>\n<p><br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u00a0<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/d\/a\/highres_395203482.jpeg","photo_id":395203482,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/d\/a\/600_395203482.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/d\/a\/thumb_395203482.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2944663,"name":"BarbW","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/0\/7\/highres_3444583.jpeg","photo_id":3444583,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/0\/7\/member_3444583.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/0\/7\/thumb_3444583.jpeg"}},"members":65,"name":"Dharma Voices for Animals - New York Chapter","id":16212652,"state":"NY","urlname":"dva-ny","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"DVA New York Chapter Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Maplewood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1407283360000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"humanrights","name":"Human Rights","id":1546},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"social-justice","name":"Social Justice","id":17986},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJ-Social-Justice-Club\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>Do you feel passionately about issues of social justice?

As entrepreneurs and professionals, it is imperative that we stay around like minded individuals. Relationships are the&nbsp;catalyst for success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. In this&nbsp;ever so growing competitive&nbsp;job market, you will quickly learn that it is not always what you know, but who do you know.<\/p>\n<p>3. You never know what personal connection or business deal is hidden in a little conversation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. If you are seasoned, you can meet a young pup with&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of pep to do heavy lifting for you.<\/p>\n<p>5.

You can consider it to be either the cool down of a long week or the warm up to a great weekend; the choice is yours.

In addition, we have noticed that most of the language assistance content has been focused on oral communication and reading of non-fiction\/short articles in English.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The organizers of this new meetup hope to bring back the meetings to the local community: Queens. In addition to English speaking and language and cultural exchange,\u00a0we will also be focusing on writing--both academic and creative (pros\/poetry) as well as reading fiction, non-fiction, short essays, articles, excerpts from books, and poems every two weeks. Hopefully, the readings will spark discussion about themes, concepts, ideas and issues relevant the Asia diaspora; Asian American; Pacific Islander and immigrant experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Our target audience is those of Asian descent in NY (Manhattan, Queens, LI, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens). Book lovers, writers, and students are encouraged to join our meetings. Whether you are a novice writer, who needs feedback, criticism, or even proof-reading; or an accomplished writer, who would like to see how your writing will be accepted by the public and how people will be impacted by your writing; or a student working on a research paper for school; in all cases, we encourage you to submit your writing and join our meet-up group. Hopefully, these original pieces will also stimulate discussion relevant to diverse Asian communities in NY and the immigrant and international experience that is NYC.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of writing are encouraged: short stories, poems, articles or essays. There will also be opportunities for peer-to-peer proofreading and also sharing your original writings with the group. There also maybe workshops on how to advance your research skills using our American library system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0And, finally, we hope to include events and activities that will allow our members to explore the city and get to know each other better. Events such as book readings and signings, dinners, or events at the Asian American Writers Workshop, or visits to interesting but obscure used bookstores, will be included.

To activate this realization, our teachers&nbsp;offer&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#transmission\">transmission<\/a> by&nbsp;non-verbally conveying the awakened condition from one individual to another. Transmission rapidly&nbsp;catalyzes your awakening, and is readily available via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#gazing\">gazing<\/a> meditation, writings, recordings, personal sessions, small group sittings or large group events.&nbsp;As a&nbsp;practitioner, you might&nbsp;notice shifts impacting many&nbsp;areas of your life in a short period of time.&nbsp;Within a few months to a few years, you\u2019ll most likely achieve your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#second-birth\">second birth<\/a>, and be deeply engaged in embodying&nbsp;that awareness throughout&nbsp;your life.<\/p> \n<p> Embodiment <\/p>\n<p>The Trillium journey&nbsp;helps you discover you are&nbsp;simultaneously infinite and finite. The embodiment dimension&nbsp;of our&nbsp;work helps you embrace infinite Consciousness throughout the full range of your unique human form, from its&nbsp;messy, uncomfortable aspects&nbsp;to its&nbsp;most&nbsp;delightful qualities.&nbsp;We use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#greenlighting\">greenlighting<\/a>, a form of&nbsp;profound compassion and radical acceptance,&nbsp;to&nbsp;become aware&nbsp;of&nbsp;whatever we are experiencing&nbsp;so that we can&nbsp;integrate it, and allow it to be organically transformed over time. Greenlighting relaxes the body-mind and enlivens the body\u2019s experience of infinite Consciousness. Facing patterns and revisiting past wounds is a natural part of the awakening process. It&nbsp;frees&nbsp;energy and attention for&nbsp;greater levels of aliveness in the present.&nbsp;For support throughout the process, we recommend you turn to&nbsp;your teachers, mentors, and peers.&nbsp;Support teams can also include <a href=\"http:\/\/teachers.trilliumawakening.org\/contact_teachers.asp#Therapist\">licensed therapists<\/a>&nbsp;as well as other practitioners within and outside the Trillium Awakening&nbsp;community.<\/p>\n<p> Mutuality<\/p>\n<p>Mutual, conscious relating is essential to the Trillium journey. Mutuality is a relationship disposition that self and other are two aspects of singular<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#being\"> Being<\/a>. In other words, other is not really \u201cother\u201d; it is also<i> you<\/i>, and it is therefore impossible to harm another person without also harming&nbsp;yourself. Living this aspect of relatedness means having profound respect for others, listening deeply, and reflecting consciously. It also means honoring and speaking your truth while making room for others to do the same\u2014which can be challenging. Through the practice of mutuality, you deeply explore and claim your authentic nature though vulnerable self-expression, even when it is uncomfortable. You also build capacity to perceive the tension and experience the discomfort in&nbsp;your differences with others. Old wounds might surface when engaging in mutuality, but, over time, the practice&nbsp;builds trust and facilitates&nbsp;deep healing and transformation. While honoring each other\u2019s truth and existential equality&nbsp;in<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trilliumawakening.org\/about\/glossary\/#being\"> Being<\/a>, mutuality simultaneously evokes&nbsp;respect for&nbsp;the functional&nbsp;hierarchy within&nbsp;our community.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>This meet up is for the spiritually minded who feel drawn to an earthy-bodily connection to being alive and presence as their lives.<\/p>\n<p>For those who are not satisfied with soaring spirituality as enjoying as that can be but only temporary but long for an embodied heart-ful connection to themselves and others. We meet in meditation and contemplate our already whole-being lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;The alchemical charge and transformational field that gets activated when we come together completely without an agenda, just for the sake of itself, is moving and inspiring.

took a great course, but the promised support and feedback wasn't there, and to get feedback and the great ideas I came up with, would have cost me hundreds or thousands of dollars.&nbsp; Instead of

We are a separate entity and nobody has to join anything to work with us.<\/p>\n<p>We sit around a big wooden table and we talk about what we want to change about ourselves and what we have to do to make that happen. New habits we want to cultivate. Old habits we want to let go of. Beliefs or reactions we have that are harmful to us and other people. Sometimes we discuss ethics or science or religion.<\/p>\n<p>We decide on goals for ourselves and go to the Ethics Lab to report and for support.<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<p>Mindfulness meditations. Losing weight. Finding a correct lay monastery to join. Developing your critical faculties by use of formal logic and\/or mathematics. Overcoming addictions including addictions to emotions or ideas. Gaining weight. Expressing yourself through artwork. Prayer. Joining a group so you can trick yourself into reinventing yourself. Yoga. Finding a boyfriend or girlfriend. Jogging. Changing careers.<\/p>\n<p>Someone pointed out that we are keeping the art of conversation alive. Yep. With a bit of Socratic method, performance art and good old fashioned magic smoke &amp; mirrors mixed in.<\/p>\n<p>Three examples of the kind of thing I might recommend to someone during a talk at the Ethics Lab.<\/p>\n<p>1. Decide on the thing you want to change in yourself and then only commit to observing yourself as it is happening as the very first step.<\/p>\n<p>2. Taking the time to find out what your thoughts and feelings are about your thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n<p>3. Understanding that meditating can be whatever you are doing at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>An Ethics Lab is a place where people with different even opposing beliefs meet and learn that we are of value to each other because of those differences. It\u2019s a lab because we see being wrong as an opportunity to learn. <\/p>\n<p>I enjoy witnessing people deciding to change then doing it. I also enjoy telling their stories. I\u2019m a writer so I see the Ethics Lab as a mix of everything from poetry to journalism. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned so much from the folks who have sat at the table with me since September of last year. Every account of conscious change I can pass on makes it easier for someone, somewhere.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin\" class=\"linkified\"><\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/highres_403135252.jpeg","photo_id":403135252,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/600_403135252.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/d\/4\/thumb_403135252.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":157419312,"name":"Vincent Downing","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/highres_222028202.jpeg","photo_id":222028202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/member_222028202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_222028202.jpeg"}},"members":67,"name":"Ethics Lab of Brooklyn","id":16620532,"state":"NY","urlname":"Ethics-Lab-of-Brooklyn","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"mental tinkerers"}],"meta":{"next":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=8&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=f86c32bb045ccac56e74c6b2f193f23a&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","method":"Groups","total_count":12921,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups","count":800,"description":"None","lon":-73.9899978638,"title":"Meetup Groups v2","url":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/groups?country=us&offset=7&city=New+York&format=json&lon=-73.9899978638&access_token=f86c32bb045ccac56e74c6b2f193f23a&state=ny&page=800&radius=25.0&fields=&lat=40.75&order=id&status=past&desc=false","id":"","updated":1464818791000,"lat":40.75}}
