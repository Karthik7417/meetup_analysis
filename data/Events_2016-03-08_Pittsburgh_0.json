You have to develop yourself to the level of professional and leadership skills that qualify you for that position (whether it's inside or outside your current organization).<br\/>3. You have to find that job in the marketplace and obtain it, or.....<br\/>4. You may have to create that job yourself by starting your own business.<\/p> <p>That's it! Sounds simple doesn't it. So why aren't more people doing it. Why aren't more people thrilled about their work? Studies show over 80% of professionals don't like their job. Nearly half of those say they \"hate it.\" How sad. Current studies show that the average person will change jobs ever 3 years and completely re-tool their career about every 12 years in search of the job they love. Many are even quitting the corporate world altogether to start their own business. The problem is, 50% of those business will fail the first year and about 90% of those businesses will fail within 5 years.<\/p> <p>What about you?

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.

We'll meet at Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside to chat, drink coffee, and listen to music. Bring your favorite music on your phone or thumb drive to share -- you can even bring an instrument to play if you'd like. And you can just come for the coffee and company \u2013 you absolutely aren't required to bring music (I will bring my laptop to look things up on YouTube as well).<\/p> <p>Bring any music -- if you have music of your own creation, if you're passionate about a particular musician or band, or if you just like something and feel like sharing. It could be a recent find or something that influenced your childhood and got you though your teenage years. It could be something you love or it could even be something you hate -- just tell us why. Music is as much a story as anything -- it could be a story of you, or the story of the artist who created the music, or the story could be embedded in the song itself waiting for us to listen. Feel free to bring a story to share along with the music -- or not, if you prefer.<\/p> <p>We're totally open to any kind of music so, please, bring anything you'd like to share be it classical, ethnic, heavy metal, or whatever -- even classical ethnic heavy metal (I bet it exists).

Despite her decade-long career in conventional, meat-centric, butter-drowned, flour-covered and sugar-coated U.S. restaurant kitchens, she identified a need for healthful foods in Pittsburgh and made it her business in 2013. By returning to her roots, she resolved some of her health issues resulted from eating whatever was readily available in restaurant kitchens.

We have already had our first class, February is the second class. This will be our last publicly available class. After this class, we will not be accepting new participants for 2016.<\/p> <p>For 2016, we are having a one year intro to shamanic practice apprenticeship program where I am sharing both my inherited traditions and the parts of other traditions I have been authorized to share with the goal of helping participants learn to use shamanic practices to help themselves and their families. This program does not make a person a shaman, though a certificate of completion can be issued at the end of the course if the person meets the requirements outlined in the student guide.<\/p> <p>A few people found it was easier to have an event page with all the info, so I have made one for this month. This will be the last class event page as it is the last open enrollment class.<\/p> <p>Also, as a side note, we will be bringing more chairs from other locations and setting the room up differently so there is more room and we don't run out of chairs this time! Loving this attendance! These big groups are a challenge but I am loving how we're sharing energy and growing together.<\/p> <p>This class will cover:<br\/>-Going over the experiential assignments from January's class and seeing how the reaction sheets and introspective experiences helped you<br\/>-Five shamanic tools, how to use them and why they work<br\/>-Music in shamanic practice (healing with individual instruments will be covered at a later time)<br\/>-Experimenting with some of my tools (I will also bring some tools that you should not touch if they wish to come, but will make clear which is which at the event)<br\/>-Preparing and getting ready to do experiments over the next month, which include finding and working with power objects, working with sound and silence, working with the Axis Mundi and like projects<\/p> <p>You do not have to bring your textbooks with you, but you will need them for assignments for the program. Here is the link to my Amazon Author's page where you can see both the textbook and workbook in case you do not have one yet: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Rebekah-Elizabeth-Gamble\/e\/B00T57HTWG\/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_3?qid=1453067370&amp;sr=8-3\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Rebekah-Elizabeth-Gamble\/e\/B00T57HTWG\/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_3?qid=1453067370&amp;sr=8-3<\/a><br\/>Please remember that as I do not make money from the textbooks (they are on the market at cost), I do not carry any for sale in my trunk. You can get them online, or order them at bookstores (including Journeys in Pittsburgh).<\/p> <p>This class, like all the classes, is $10. This is due at the class, and if you miss a class, you do not need to pay for it. This is done to cover the expenses of the program and to keep the course as accessible and unburdening as possible.<\/p> <p>If you do not have a student guide, you need one!

Cecilia Fitzpatrick lives to be perfect: a perfect marriage, three perfect daughters, and a perfectly organized life. Then she finds a letter from her husband, John-Paul, to be opened only in the event of his death. She opens it anyway, and everything she believed is thrown into doubt. Meanwhile, Tess O'Leary's husband, Will, and her cousin and best friend, Felicity, confess they've fallen in love, so Tess takes her young son, Liam, and goes to Sydney to live with her mother. There she meets up with an old boyfriend, Connor Whitby, while enrolling Liam in St. Angela's Primary School, where Cecilia is the star mother. Rachel Crowley, the school secretary, believes that Connor, St. Angela's PE teacher, is the man who, nearly three decades before, got away with murdering her daughter\u2014a daughter for whom she is still grieving. Simultaneously a page-turner and a book one has to put down occasionally to think about and absorb, Moriarty's novel challenges the reader as well as her characters, but in the best possible way.

Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls.

Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush examine this issue through the lens of three people who are struggling with food insecurity: Barbie, a single Philadelphia mother who grew up in poverty and is trying to provide a better life for her two kids; Rosie, a Colorado fifth-grader who often has to depend on friends and neighbors to feed her and has trouble concentrating in school; and Tremonica, a Mississippi second-grader whose asthma and health issues are exacerbated by the largely empty calories her hardworking mother can afford.<\/p> <p><br\/>Their stories are interwoven with insights from experts including sociologist Janet Poppendieck, author Raj Patel and nutrition policy leader Marion Nestle; ordinary citizens like Pastor Bob Wilson and teachers Leslie Nichols and Odessa Cherry; and activists such as Witness to Hunger's Mariana Chilton, Top Chef's Tom Colicchio and Oscar\u00ae-winning actor Jeff Bridges.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ultimately, <i><b>A Place at the Table<\/b><\/i> shows us how hunger poses serious economic, social and cultural implications for our nation, and that it could be solved once and for all, if the American public decides-as they have in the past-that making healthy food available and affordable is in the best interest of us all.<\/p> <p><b><i>Please Note: All attendees are encouraged to bring one or more food items to the showing of the film as part of a campus-wide food drive in support of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.

So bring a game you want to try, or come try some games that you likely won't find in the toy aisle at Wal-Mart. These games come from all over the world. We have a group of folks who are usually excited to teach someone a new or classic game, and we have people who are very game (sorry) to give any games that you may bring a shot. Experienced? Inexperienced? In between? Need a little coaching to get through your turn? Ready to give it a shot? Come out and see us! Drop in any time after Noon. People come and go all day. RSVPs are appreciated, but drop in last minute if that's how life is working out for you. There is no admission to attend. There is a rather good selection on food as well. For those who would enjoy beers and especially craft beers, they do have such things on site. We'll be playing in the dining area. Note that the dining area and food preparation services both shut down at 10 PM. We try to wind things down at 9:30 to make life easier on the Giant Eagle Market District Express Staff.<\/p> <p>If you have ideas for venues and towns in which to hold an event in mind, please do contact me. We know there are a lot of towns that hope to game that we are missing good events on the map. We have a lot of assistant organizers, and we're pretty liberal about handing out the duty and title, because all it truly means is you have taken the effort to arrange something, and you should be the contact for any questions about it. We don't need money or a great amount of time from you. Just a willing heart, a face welcoming to all comers, and your enthusiasm is all it really takes. We have games.

After 43 years of eventful music, the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble remains the second-longest continuous group stemming from Chicago's innovative AACM collective (next to the Art Ensemble of Chicago). This year, the EHE reinvents itself again, as founder Kahil El'Zabar (percussion\/vocal\/composition) is joined by two true legends of the American progressive jazz scene: Hamiet bluiett (baritone sax\/clarinet - World Saxophone Quartet) and Craig Harris (trombone\/didjeridu - played with Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Sam Rivers, Don Byron, etc.)<\/p> <p>The history and depth between these master players represents the highest level of performance, and the music is endowed with an authentic pedigree that pushes the boundaries of creative music into the soulful heart of fresh expression. The convergence of these three historical and impactful figures at this particular juncture means the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble is still reinventing itself while blazing pathways through the African American musical pantheon. Hamiett Bluiett, Craig Harris and Kahil El\u2019Zabar are the real deal and always ready to make real music!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Jazz-Fan-Meetup-Group\/events\/228885417\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Ethnic Heritage Ensemble 2\/20 @ First Unitarian","id":"228885417","time":1456014600000,"updated":1456027013000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1245748581000,"name":"Pittsburgh Jazz Fan  Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":1478004,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Jazz-Fan-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Pittsburgh Jazz Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Houston","address_1":"10 N.

Event Details:<br\/>Ok, folks, I've gotten a lot of requests for exceptions for the Intro to Shamanic Practice class, people who wanted to come but didn't know about the class in January and then couldn't get to the class in February due to the snow\/ice\/cold. Though some people simply didn't want the information in the Feb. class enough and that's the real reason they didn't come, many who are asking couldn't make it because they are disabled, bus reliant or had like instances that kept them from coming. I know what it's like to be there, and since I don't know that I'll ever offer this program again I feel down about people not being able to come due to these limiting issues.<\/p> <p>SOOO I am setting up an online catch-up class. I apologize that it's not on a Saturday, but my next open Saturday is in April, and you really do need these two classes to have the foundation you need to do the rest of the program. Though you won't be able to have the experiences we had in the classes which help build that foundation, I am going to combine the intellectual information from the first two classes and give you a combined assignment to try to give you the same foundations. This should give you what you need to do the rest of the course, though it's not anywhere near as fun or upbuilding as the in person classes (where we did a committment ceremony and a hands-on exploration of different tools and instruments) when done over a distance, this is what I can do without scheduling other class, which is just not possible. Instead, I figured out how to do a Google hangout and we're going to do that instead.<\/p> <p>I decided to take the time for this class from my business hours so I could spend at least one evening this week with my family, which means that I am losing client hours to provide the catch-up class. Those client hours are how I make the money that keeps my practice open. So this event is going to cost a little more than the monthly class to make up for what it's costing the business.<\/p> <p>The cost of the catch-up online conference is $22 a person. You can send me an RSVP email and I can send you an invoice via paypal, or you can send me a PayPal payment at [masked] (I will get your email from the reciept paypal gives me, so that will be the email I use for contact for the call in link). Fifteen minutes before I start the hangout, I will email you a connection link so you can connect in.

Paul Randal will be presenting on: Index Fragmentation: Internals, Analysis, and Solutions<\/p> <p>As soon as you have more than one index on a table, you're going to start seeing fragmentation. Many people know that this fragmentation is bad, but why is it bad? And what is the best way to get rid of it? Come find out from the person who wrote the tools for detecting and removing index fragmentation. In this session, you\u2019ll learn how fragmentation occurs and why the process that leads to it can often be as damaging to performance as the fragmentation itself. You'll also learn how to test for fragmentation, the different methods of removing it, and everything you need to consider when putting together an appropriate fragmentation-management strategy.<\/p> <p><br\/>About Paul:<br\/>Paul is a Microsoft SQL Server MVP and a Microsoft Regional Director. He spent 9 years working on the SQL Server team, writing DBCC CHECKDB, and ultimately responsible for the entire Storage Engine.

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup.

It will take an invitation from a man who\u2019s flown to the moon, the arrival of a unique little boy, and concern from a charming veterinarian to reawaken her wounded spirit. Any life can be derailed, but the healing power of community can put it right again.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/a\/5\/d\/600_446106749.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the tables near the beer sales","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club\/events\/228256623\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"North Hills meeting - The Art of Arranging Flowers by Lynne Branard","id":"228256623","time":1456358400000,"updated":1456437215000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1179772522000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Chick Lit Book Club","group_lon":-80.0699996948,"id":507383,"urlname":"Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club","group_lat":40.5,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15228","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"16 Castle Shannon Blvd ","lon":-80.045384,"phone":"412-531-1161","name":"Mount Lebanon Public Library","id":981790,"state":"PA","lat":40.377195,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.15854358673,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450973663000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Discuss the Month's science fiction selection and other topics realted to the world of science and science fiction.

What are your libraries hiding, and how do you know?<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Abstract: Libraries and Frameworks greatly assist developers to bolster functionality and meet deadlines. However, are these components introducing risk and vulnerabilities? Also, how does an overtasked and deadline driven developer stay up-to-date on the state of these dependencies? Attendees will discover the alarming statistics that security professionals identified regarding the sheer percentages of vulnerable libraries and frameworks. Additionally, participants will acquire information on some great manual scripts and open-source utilities to help automate this process. Since writing all components from scratch is too cumbersome and inefficient, attend this session to acquire the means to ensure the best risk adverse and well maintained libraries are utilized.<\/p> <p><br\/>Speaker: Kevin Cody<\/p> <p>Bio:\u00a0Kevin Cody is an Application Security Engineer with experience working at several Fortune 500 enterprises.

I'll cover my experience, my choice to jump directly into the real world of business in lieu of college, and how young people can accelerate their careers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that we'll just be sharing ideas, drinks, and food! Be sure to come out Thursday and join us in Shadyside. We're excited about meeting early stage startup founders, young people hungry to get their careers started, and everybody in between! We'll have free copies of books like The Future of School, Why Haven't You Read This Book? and others available for those interested.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be on the second floor of the restaurant.

On Black Friday in 2012, two cars parked next to each other at a Florida gas station. A white middle-aged male and a black teenager exchanged angry words over the volume of the music in the boy\u2019s car. A gun entered the exchange, and one of them was left dead.<\/p> <p>Michael Dunn fired 10 bullets at a car full of unarmed teenagers and then fled. Three of those bullets hit 17-year-old Jordan Davis, who died at the scene. Arrested the next day, Dunn claimed he shot in self-defense. Thus began the long journey of un-raveling the truth. 3\u00bd Minutes, Ten Bullets follows that journey, reconstructing the night of the murder and revealing how hidden racial prejudice can result in tragedy.<\/p> <p>Directed by Marc Silver (Who is Dayani Cristal?), the documentary intercuts powerful exclusive footage from a riveting trial with intimate, observational scenes of Jordan\u2019s parents, Ron and Lucy. We see firsthand how difficult it is for them to grapple with unimaginable loss while fighting for justice for their son. The film integrates police interrogation footage, prison phone recordings and interviews with the others at the scene that night.

We got a bit of a late start, but starting in March we will be on schedule. Welcome to new members! I am happy to see that this group is still growing after more than a year!<\/p> <p><b>Topic for this meeting<\/b><\/p> <p>C.S. Lewis is a famous author of children's stories, but in addition he was: a poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, broadcaster, lecturer, and Christian apologist. In his own words he once said, \"I am the most dejected, reluctant convert in all England\". C.S. Lewis was an atheist, an intellectual, logic was his tool of trade. Then he converted to Christianity. All for very rational reasons. We will see his rationale in our upcoming meetings.\u00a0<\/p> <p>He wrote a famous book about apologetics called \"Mere Christianity\" in which he uses logical arguments to deduce why Christianity must be true. This book is very often quoted by nearly all apologists I have ever heard.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDuring our next few meetings we will be looking at the book \"Mere Christianity\" in detail. We could just read it, and discuss it, but there is an excellent illustrated version of it on youtube.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will watch these short videos together during the meetings and then discuss the topics from the videos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>These videos are actually BBC radio broadcasts during WW2 of C.S. Lewis himself reading his book, and an excellent artist illustrates what C.S. Lewis is discussing to get the message across even stronger.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Here is a link to the video\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QmHXYhpEDfM&amp;list=PL9boiLqIabFhrqabptq3ThGdwNanr65xU\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QmHXYhpEDfM&amp;list=PL9boiLqIabFhrqabptq3ThGdwNanr65xU<\/a><\/p> <p>FYI: Interesting sidenote: These BBC talks were meant to ask the question, \"Is England the moral country in the conflict of WW2 or is Germany?\". This was way before anything was known about the Holocaust. So Lewis goes into a philosophical discourse of what is right and what is wrong, and where God fits in.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will be meeting at the Squirrel Hill library in meeting room C as usual.

I'm very excited about this! Way to go everyone!<\/p> <p><br\/>Just a reminder that this week, we were only able to book two courts for the first hour, then one court for the next hour.\u00a0 We can possibly keep the one court longer, but (last I heard) that was the best Greentree Sportsworks was able to do for us this week.<\/p> <p><br\/>I'm glad to see all the enthusiasm, but I just don't what anyone who didn't realize about the court limitations to be disappointed.<\/p> <p>I have thought carefully about this.\u00a0 20 people trying to share two badminton courts the normal way would mean quite a bit of waiting around.\u00a0 In fact if we all arrive on time and stay for the two hours, since we have three court-hours booked, and each court-hour translates to four player-hours (doubles format), we have twelve player-hours booked.\u00a0 Based on the RSVP's we'll all be spending two hours at the facility (plus our drive times) for 12 player hours\/20\u00a0 players or 60% of an hour (36 minutes of play, average, per player), unless we stay longer.<\/p> <p><br\/>(Correction ::\u00a0 We have two courts for two hours, AND a third court for one hour)<\/p> <p><br\/>I propose we consider playing \"king's court\" during the latter hour if we are reduced to one court as expected.<br\/>This is where mini-matches are played and the winner of each mini-match defends the \"king's court\" while everyone else takes turn being the challengers.<br\/>It is fast-paced, and funny because each player serves as soon as they can, not necessarily waiting until the other side is ready.\u00a0 this brings an element of surprise and sabotage to the game -- no one is immune , even the best players, to being deposed off their \"throne\", and everyone stays busy and involved :)<\/p> <p><br\/>Another good thing about this meetup is it will be cheap... the cost of the three court hours is $75 plus birdies and tape so dividing the approximately $80 twenty ways is only $4 each).\u00a0 And who knows, maybe we will be able to get another court after all (there's always a chance the other party may cancel).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Correction: More like five court hours, $125 + misc, so more like $6, at most $7 per person if everyone shows up.<\/p> <p><br\/>Consider posting under our discussion forums about where in the city you live (approximately, as in what neighborhood or at least what direction you are coming to Greentree from and about how long it takes you to get there).<\/p> <p>We are a big enough group we should be able to get additional regularly scheduled times and places going in the greater Pittsburgh area.<\/p> <p>I'm trying to get the attention of the group for an opportunity to rent three badminton courts every Sunday night, usually we could start at 6 pm but there may be some weeks where we can't start until 7, but we could rent them for as long as we want which means we can have as big of a group as we want (48 players over two hours everyone would get at least half hour play time, in theory). Please read and consider RSVPing for the Southpointe Courthouse opportunity on Sunday evenings I posted.<\/p> <p>We could also arrange to use that facility on another night of the week, but we'd have to sign up months in advance. We might be able to start by September? Who would be interested in say, Tuesday nights at that facility?<\/p> <p><br\/>(Advantages of Southpointe Courthouse include their willingness to purchase real badminton nets (instead of the volleyball nets we use at Greentree), and that there are already semi-permanent (taped) lines put down, instead of putting down our own lines every time)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Badminton\/events\/228865407\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":7200000,"name":"Greentree Sportsworks, Sat, Feb 27, 4-6pm","id":"228865407","time":1456606800000,"updated":1456679806000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1440781953000,"name":"Pittsburgh Badminton","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":18877001,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Badminton","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Badminton players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":2.07714033127,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447009009000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let us come together to build a community of meditators and spread the benefits of meditation among Pittsburghers.

UNLESS It's A CHARITY CRAWL and then it's still CHEAP! This is a Charity crawl so it's $5 a person. Remember we are doing this for the hell of it!!!<\/p> <p>3. It is good to tip; it is not so good to assume you know the best place to put the bills.<\/p> <p>4. If you ignore the whistle and show up late to the next bar or without a nametag, you may not get the special and you may have to pay the cover to get in. You can get nametags at the first 3 bars.<\/p> <p>5. You are responsible for your behavior. If you get drunk, it is your own fault, not our fault and not the bar's. Take a cab home.(We recommend Classy Cab or UBERX I like going home in a Limo).<\/p> <p>6. You are also responsible for the people you invite. If you know someone is a nasty or problem drunk, do not invite him..her. The pub-crawl is not the place for him\/her to display his\/her talents. If you cause a problem, you will be asked to leave and so will the person who invited you. We have a good reputation.<\/p> <p>7. We are hitting 11 BARS YOU Don't have to DRINK at every BAR and remember to EAT!<\/p> <p>Remember this will be a PACKED CRAWL! I'm picking the LARGER and sometimes more OFF-THE-BEATEN TRACK places so we can fit in. But like always, if a place is TOO CROWDED, Scout Ahead and get your seats. Also we will have at some time slots TWO BARS at the SAME TIME! towards the END of the Crawl.<\/p> <p>Remember UBER\\LYFT, Designated Drivers, Classy Cab, Yellow Cab and PRICELINE (for getting hotels), Air BNB, Couchsurfing Dot Com are your friends. Or staying at a friends house or hooking up with a local (Use protection ;-).

One day, a mentor of hers made a comment that in a way, past life work was like journeying to middle world. She happened to also be finishing a degree in metaphysical sciences at the University of Metaphysical Sciences at the time, where reincarnation studies and hypnotherapy were offered. Rebekah was curious about that thought, and started playing with the different forms of past life regression she had developed with her own self-healing work and combining it with shamanic methods she was using for soul retrieval work. Over time, these curiosities combined with her studies at UMS led to developing several new methods to perform past life regression.<br\/>For the past two years, Rebekah has been testing her theories and practices on volunteers in both academic settings, with volunteer clients at her clinical practice, and with personal friends. She has had great success teaching people how to do their own past life regression work using shamanic methods, even over a distance and in small groups. She's finally ready to present the techniques in a workshop format so you can enjoy the experience and take control of your own healing.<\/p> <p><br\/>This workshop will include a general discussion of reincarnation, the soul from the perspective of indigenous people as well as science and pop culture, and reincarnation theories from around the world. We will also discuss scientific evidence and case studies that suggest reincarnation as a plausible possiblity and other explanations for these experiences besides reincarnation before actually doing the regression exercises.<\/p> <p>We will do several regressions with the intent of you being able to experience a method you can recreate on your own. We will also show how this process can be applied to self healing, exploring and healing relationships, and healing fears.<\/p> <p>For the regressions, we will do the exercises, then have some quiet time where you can journal and process. After this, you will have the opportunity to share your experiences.<\/p> <p>This is the first time this has ever been presented. Spaces are limited to SEVEN participants. Cost of the workshop is $40 at the door, $35 pre-paid. You may send pre-payments to [masked] via paypal. We encourage prepaying for this event to guarantee your space, but caution that refunds will only be provided should the host cancel the event.<\/p> <p>What are folks saying about their experiences with the new methods?<\/p> <p>\"So much of my life makes sense now.

The story follows a police officer and his son as they travel across a barren feudal landscape in pursuit of a runaway gypsy slave. In their journey they encounter people of different religions and nationalities, each with their own prejudices and opinions. Beautifully shot in black &amp; white, this stunning tale incorporates both humor and history. Alternating between action scenes and surreal dialogue, the film is a gripping look at the political and religious landscape of 19th century Eastern Europe rife with meanings for today.

His family moved to the territory via steamship in the late nineteenth century and later established one of the largest commercial reindeer herds in the history of Alaska. Derry\u2019s ongoing interest in mechanical devices and amateur engineering can be, at least partially, attributed to his childhood experience repairing Craftsman lawn mowers. In his artistic practice, he explores the lived experience of a place and investigates alternative strategies for inhabiting these environments. Derry\u2019s work includes installations, commissions and curatorial projects. He has developed projects for the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area, Trust for Public Land, Anchorage Museum at the Rasmuson Center, Art in Action, National Institute for Fitness and Sport, and Waterman Agricultural Center. He has completed public commissions for the University of Alaska, the City of Indianapolis, and Indianapolis Cultural Trail. In 2006, Derry\u2019s commission, Charting Pogue\u2019s Run, was featured in the Americans for the Arts Year in Review. Derry is the recipient of grants from the Sprout Fund, Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, Alaska State Council on the Arts, and Edith Fergus-Gilmore Trust. Sean Derry currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is the area head of sculpture at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.<\/p> <p><b>Register at:<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/techshoppgh.com\/lectures\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/techshoppgh.com\/lectures<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TechShopPittsburgh\/events\/228295547\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Industry Artisan Lecture Series No. 1 Meet Up","id":"228295547","time":1456700400000,"updated":1456712817000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364407010000,"name":"TechShop Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":7808532,"urlname":"TechShopPittsburgh","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Dream Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15206","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"6617 Hamilton Ave","lon":-79.909891,"phone":"412.901.4298","name":"Absolute Ballroom Dancing","id":1120340,"state":"PA","lat":40.457782,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.27536725998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455645495000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/1\/a\/600_446932506.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>**RUEDA DE BACHATA 6-WEEK SERIES!!**<\/p> <p><br\/>Join us for an exciting new 6-week series to take your Bachata skills to the next level!!

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/228767375\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"dxhtnlyvfbcb","time":1456880400000,"updated":1456889533000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.7600021362,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Volleyball Monsters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15219","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"225 Station Square","lon":-80.003711,"phone":"412-232-3101","name":"Buckhead Saloon","id":858565,"state":"PA","lat":40.432542,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.83878779411,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440000802000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>NO COVER CHARGE, NO DRINK MINIMUM, $6, $10 and $14 Beer Bucket Specials, $3 16oz Reds Apple Ale Drafts ....

A household name as the host of 'Rise and Shine', the country's highest-rated morning talk show, Meghan cuts to a commercial break, but not before she mutters two forbidden words into her open mike. In an instant, it's the end of an era - not only for Meghan, who is unaccustomed to dealing with adversity, but also for her younger sister, Bridget, a social worker in the Bronx who has always lived in Meghan's long shadow. The effect of Meghan's on-air truth-telling reverberates through both of their lives, affecting Meghan's son, husband, friends, and fans, as well as Bridget's perception of her sister, their complex childhood, and herself. What follows is a story about how, in very different ways, the Fitzmaurice women adapt, survive, and manage to bring the whole teeming world of New York to heel, by dint of their smart mouths, quick wits, and the powerful connection between them that even the worst tragedy cannot shatter.<\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please Bring a Chick Lit\/Women's Fiction book (that is out in paperback)!<\/b><\/p> <p>Not sure what to bring?<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Chick Lit: Chick lit is genre fiction within women's fiction which addresses issues of modern women often humorously and lightheartedly*<\/p> <p>Here is the definition of Women's Fiction: a modern novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth.

Adibi calls these paintings \u201cRespiration Paintings\u201d because she sees them as existing not only as physical objects, but also in the air; when they are first exhibited, the paintings emit scents that allow an audience to breathe them as well as see them. While her use of aromatherapy oils in oil painting is new, plant oils such as linseed and safflower have been used since the beginning of oil painting. Adibi\u2019s paintings investigate the etheric substance that binds together the viewer and the painting through a living force. Her use of plant oils connects contemporary abstract painting to its pre-modern history of materials, engaging the tradition of oil painting and renewing its potential for healing through a recovered connection to the natural world.<\/p> <p>Elise Adibi currently has a studio at 7800 Susquehanna Street and is working on an upcoming show for the greenhouse at The Frick Pittsburgh in 2017. Adibi received a MFA from Columbia University, she also has a BA in Philosophy from Swarthmore College, and a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. In 2013 and 2014 Adibi was a Fellow at The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. She has twice received grants from The Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and in 2007, The Terra Foundation awarded her a fellowship in Giverny, France (Monet\u2019s village). In 2010, Adibi worked with the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts\/Pittsburgh Filmmakers to curate \u201cGold in Braddock\u201d at UnSmoke Art Systems. In 2011, Adibi was included in the Pittsburgh Biennial,\u201cGertrude\u2019s\/LOT,\u201d at The Andy Warhol Museum, curated by Eric Shiner.

We will have lists of \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d including sourcing, research, editing for spelling\/grammar, verifying references, linking and other important general improvements to help make Wikipedia great. We'll also have resources and librarians on hand to help you get started.<\/p> <p>Are men welcome?<br\/>Yes. People of all gender expressions and sexual orientations are welcome.

Musically, these vastly different aspects of the story are somehow made harmonious, even essential, through a series of contemplative choral moments and solo arias by which we, the audience, are called upon to contemplate our own strengths and weaknesses and to see for ourselves how our own choices hold up under the scrutiny provided by the story of a man whose final days might be viewed as an exemplary, and utterly human, moment of moral reserve and psychological triumph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In this production, my hope is to present the Passion against a backdrop of images from our daily lives: familiar, almost banal moments of daily reality, acts of love and selfishness, anguish and joy, of choices made, for better or worse, of the promise of a better life through technology and endless goods and services, and also of misery, routine violence and nonstop fear of \u201cthe other.\u201d In developing this production, I found myself inspired by Bach\u2019s\u00a0<i>St. John Passion<\/i>\u00a0to think deeply about my own life and personal choices. The piece seems to conclude with the provocative notion that there is no \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d but rather a complicated, sometimes beautiful, sometimes savage, fabric of individuals and groups called humanity, from which emerges equal parts love, compassion, courage, hatred, anger and a thousand other emotions and actions. I hope others may find opportunities for reflection as well; to feel caught up in both the Passion itself, and in that wonderful spell that music and drama can cast upon us.<\/p> <p>\u2014Sam Helfrich<\/p> <p><b>Parking<\/b> Here is the ParkPGH website with real-time info on downtown parking garage availability <a href=\"http:\/\/parkpgh.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/parkpgh.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/parkpgh.org<\/a><\/a> where you can also download apps, get garage availability via text messaging, etc. You can also call[masked]-8980.<\/p> <p>Stay tuned for updates!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"For discount tickets, please meet inside Heinz Hall Box Office by 1:15 PM.

(In fact, you will be encouraged to dance with more experienced dancers rather than with other beginners.)<\/p> <p>The $7.00 fee per person for each class covers the cost of renting the room and paying the teacher. First-time attendees and dues-paying members pay only $5. We do not want price to be an obstacle for anyone attending class. Beginners have the option of purchasing a coupon booklet (good for 10 classes) for $30. Full-time students can always pay only $3 to attend.
