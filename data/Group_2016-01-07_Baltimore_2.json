We will only allow Traditional bluegrass instruments - Acoustic 6 String Guitar, Mandolin, Fiddle, Dobro, Upright Bass, and 5 String Banjo. Harmonicas are okay too if you can really play it! Also, acoustic bass is okay if you can't bring the upright. While all are welcome at this jam we will be playing some intermediate to advanced bluegrass. Don't let this scare you away!

There are many other factors such as backgrounds, clothing and the message you want to convey that go into creating a portrait. Those will all be addressed as needed or in a separate class. The classes are for people who want to improve their people portraits. Anyone can pick up a camera these days and take a photo but to take a portrait to the next level requires more thought, understanding and a lot of practice. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I'd like to see how the group evolves, but for now we'll&nbsp;get together on location, near Silver Spring, Bethesda and NW and learn about natural portrait posing and lighting. Sometimes we will go for an urban look and other times we might go to a park. We will look for lighting situations that mimic studio lighting without lighting equipment (except maybe a reflector). We will pose each other as singles, couples and groups and occasionally we'll have a model. Next fall I may teach studio portraits.

This group is for promoting health and wellness through an ancient practice called QiGong. What is Qigong? Qigong focuses on improving physical health and wellness. It opens the energy flow within the body by eliminating blockages. The intent is to balance the body by opening the energetic pathways (meridians). This is accomplished by a series of gentle movements synchronized with the breath. This form of Qigong can be safely practiced by the beginner, with limited movement, to the most advanced student. It benefits all students and aides them in moving forward no matter what their prior experiences. Each class is started with a set of Opening Moves to allow the body structure to open in all directions. Next, we move through the Qigong movements. These movements focus on Energy passing through specific pathways (or meridians). The class ends with a closing Qigong form that integrates the mind-body-spirit to a more grounded state of well-being. Qigong is an excellent tool to acquire mind-body-spirit awareness. Its movements provide a path toward personal transformation. Each individual may have a different experience each time they practice the form. The goal is as they work toward balance of the Yin-Yang Qi they will notice improved health, increased energy and a greater awareness of life. What are the benefits? Qigong enhances immune function, reduces the ill effects of stress, prevents disease, calms the mind and emotions, lowers blood pressure, increases flexibility, cultivates energy, treats chronic pain, and improves sleep.<\/p>","lon":-76.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":86625662,"name":"joff headley","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/highres_245134649.jpeg","photo_id":245134649,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/member_245134649.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/7\/5\/9\/thumb_245134649.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Laurel Qigong Meetup","id":18535847,"state":"MD","urlname":"Laurel-Qigong-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.0999984741,"who":"qi members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hyattsville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428520023000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"homeless","name":"Homelessness","id":3777},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"family-and-friends","name":"Family and Friends","id":16929},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"people-helping-people","name":"People Helping People","id":20274},{"urlkey":"healthy-lifestyles","name":"Healthy Lifestyles","id":32598},{"urlkey":"event-planning-fundraising","name":"Event Planning & Fundraising","id":77233},{"urlkey":"ptsd-recovery","name":"PTSD Recovery","id":88088},{"urlkey":"military-and-veterans","name":"Military and Veterans","id":91416},{"urlkey":"grief-recovery","name":"Grief Recovery","id":105011},{"urlkey":"homeless-outreach","name":"Homeless Outreach","id":168756},{"urlkey":"complementary-and-alternative-therapies","name":"Complementary and Alternative Therapies","id":1064432}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/VeteransForeverSoldiers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Veterans Forever Soldiers (VFS) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization with a mission to Honor, Respect, and Care for United States Military Veterans.

Men don't always want to do what we want to do.&nbsp;Do you often find yourself not having many girlfriends or&nbsp;female relatives&nbsp;to hang out with&nbsp;any more because they have relocated, gotten married, have&nbsp;mommy duties or have a certain time to be home.&nbsp;Do you sometimes&nbsp;find yourself sitting at home on a beautiful sunny day with no girlfriends&nbsp;to chill with. Or on a weekend night watching Lifetime, LMN&nbsp;or Bravo? Do you just want to be spontaneous sometimes and just call and&nbsp;say let's go out or do something fun?&nbsp;This group is for heterosexual, Christian, &nbsp;professional, classy, intelligent, positive and drama-free and like-minded women that are seeking to socialize and build true lasting friendships that will develop into a sisterhood. This will be a small group to foster a close knit and engaging atmosphere. The group will consist of women that are supportive, encouraging, inspirational and uplifting&nbsp;to one another. Let's engage in some awesome activities, while developing bonds and making memories that will last a lifetime. Some of the activities include: dining, brunch, lounges,&nbsp;cruises, festivals, concerts, plays, broadway musicals, live bands, weekend getaways, movies, spas, picnics and day trips. Having&nbsp;children or getting married doesn't define you,&nbsp;they enhance your life. We never know what God has in store for us. Until then,&nbsp;let's live our lives and enjoy us until we do get married and become moms.&nbsp;If you are interested in meeting other wonderful, like-minded ladies to explore the DMV and so much more, please join this group. I understand that sometimes you won't be able to attend every outing, but please be an active participant to make this group a success. This is not just a meetup but friendship group. Constant no shows will lead to the member being deleted from the group.<b>&nbsp;Currently this group is closed to new members.<\/b><\/p>","lon":-76.8499984741,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12883359,"name":"Ms. Liss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/highres_245843547.jpeg","photo_id":245843547,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/member_245843547.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/f\/b\/thumb_245843547.jpeg"}},"members":123,"name":"Laurel Sisterhood Meetup Ages 30-40 (Single\/Without Kids)","id":18573534,"state":"MD","urlname":"Lovely-Ladies-of-Laurel-Meetup-Ages-33-39-Single-No-Kids","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":39.0600013733,"who":"Lovely Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1430603561000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"trail-running","name":"Trail Running","id":16301},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"beginners-running","name":"Beginner's Running","id":24325},{"urlkey":"womens-running","name":"Women's Running","id":37072},{"urlkey":"long-distance-running","name":"Long Distance Running","id":38289},{"urlkey":"road-running","name":"Road Running","id":49699},{"urlkey":"running-with-friends","name":"Running with Friends","id":92083},{"urlkey":"running-training","name":"running training","id":99282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BaltimoreRATrunners\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>We are a social running group that welcomes people of all paces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While Baltimore is known for its rats that scurry underneath, we scurry over Roads And Trails --we are the Baltimore RAT Runners.&nbsp;It seems many of our runners are new to town, so if \"B'more\" and \"Hon\" are new to you, you should feel right at home with us.<\/p> \n<p>Our Monday runs start at 6:45 p.m. next to the Under Armour store on S.

Our center is located at 424 Fourth Street in Annapolis. We gather six times a week to study and practice: we recite traditional chants, practice various meditation techniques, discuss traditional texts, and more.&nbsp;Please take a look at our ongoing calendar for upcoming meetups.<br><br><b>ABOUT THE CENTER<\/b><br><br>The Gampopa Center was founded in 2009 in Annapolis, Maryland, by Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche based on the Buddhist understanding that the teachings of Buddha can bring us peace, happiness, and freedom. Lama\u2019s students were excited to welcome a qualified Tibetan Buddhist teacher into the community and wanted to provide a place for learning and practicing Dharma.&nbsp;<br><br>As a growing community of lay Dharma practitioners, we are grounded in but not limited to the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage. The Center consists of a small shrine room, and we are actively looking to enlarge our facility.<br><br><b>ABOUT OUR MAIN TEACHER<\/b><br><br>Our community is grateful for the opportunity to learn and practice under the direction of an authentic, accomplished guide, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche.&nbsp;<br><br>Born in Tibet in 1973, he is a monk, scholar, and author. The Dalai Lama and the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa have glowingly endorsed his book&nbsp;<i>The Lamp of Reasoning and Scriptures of the Sage, the Buddha<\/i>.&nbsp;<br><br>He has completed a traditional three-year retreat under the guidance of the Very Venerable Bokar Rinpoche, who subsequently appointed Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche to be a three-year-retreat teacher. He has received advanced Buddhist training from masters in India, Sikkim, and Nepal. Now a citizen of the United States, Lama Phurbu Tashi Rinpoche makes his home in Annapolis, Maryland.<br><br>______________________________________<br><br><i>The Gampopa Center has an open door policy.

This group is not JUST for women interested in my tours! You are welcome even if you are not interested in such tours....but, enjoy meeting other traveling ladies and going to cultural events. This Meetup has no yearly fee, one-time fee, or event fees (other than the cost of whatever we are doing). Come on out! We always have a great time and the company is wonderful!<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>\"Are you an older woman (40 and up) who wants adventure, wants to travel to other countries but doesn't want to go alone and doesn't want to spend a fortune joining a group (usually $300\/day plus an added fee for not having someone to share a room with)? Do you not want to be on a tour bus going to tourist hotels and tourist restaurants? Older Women, Cheap Travel offer tours that cost one-third of what most companies charge and all of us women (10 per trip) share rooms which keeps the cost low. We also take local transportation (like \"Chicken Buses\" and Tuk-Tuks) and eat local food (in the market, on the street, in small restaurants). We see the sites but we also enjoy the culture by going where the locals go and not just to tourist venues. I, Pat Brown, will be your guide. Our upcoming trips are to Nicaragua from Jan 5-16, 2016, India in March of 2016 and Mexico in the fall of 2016. Find out more about the trips and how we travel.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.olderwomencheaptravel.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.olderwomencheaptravel.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When we meet, we will enjoy international food at a variety of restaurants and we will talk about our experiences as women travelers and share tips and stories and our wish list of places to go. You may find yourself a travel partner, you may find great ideas to travel solo or hear about wonderful opportunities to join groups at a cheap price (like this great hiking group I joined in Guatemala; $20-$30\/day for the hiking guide, lodging, and food and all the money earned went to charity!) Even if you never go on an Older Women, Cheap Travel trip, you are welcome to join our Meetup event and share travel ideas and experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are not 20 or 30, you can still have a travel adventure and not go broke doing it.

Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<p>What we offer: Our ongoing drop-in Tuesday evening classes generally consist of one or two half hour semi-guided meditations, mindful movement, a talk on Buddhist principles and their application to daily life, followed by discussion and\/or practice.<\/p>\n<p>We offer workshops (typically day long) to help deepen practice. Some of our workshop topics are: Deepening Insight, a Daylong Silent Workshop; Insight Out Loud (working with partners to deepen insight); A Day of Heart Practices; Deepening Presence; and a Relationship Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Our 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses help students initiate and develop an ongoing daily mindfulness meditation practice. These 8-week courses are designed to help students develop strategies to reduce stress and to relate to their day-to-day experiences in a more calm and creative manner.<\/p>\n<p>We also sponsor Kalyani-Mitta (KM) groups. These are groups that meet outside the normal class hours to discuss Buddhist principles more in depth and to share about how these ideas apply to their personal lives.

I am less interested in having a support group or therapy sessions, and more interested in just having fun with some down-to-Earth, good-natured people who don't have the most active social lives, or are just plain bored. Anyone is welcome, but just keep in mind that I myself am not exactly a socialite, and am doing this as a way to get out of the house more. Don't expect large gatherings of dozens of people or rowdy nights out; I'm more into just relaxing, going to the movies, or finding a place to hang out where we can do something simple.<\/p>\n<p>I've also found that many meetup groups tend to have members of mixed ages, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I think it'd be nice to have a group in the Baltimore area (I'm in Dundalk, or the 21224 zip code for reference) for shy people exclusively in their 20's so that we don't have to feel even more out of place or awkward than we already might. Also, groups geared toward very specific, \"geeky\" activities are fine, but unless you're intimately familiar with whatever the hobby is, there's a good chance that you'll stand out or feel insecure if you have anxiety and aren't a super expert at anything in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I don't want anyone to have to feel that way. I just want friends -- regardless of what their knowledge of advanced literature or geek culture is like, and without anyone having to worry about not fitting in or being drowned out in a large crowd. Let's see if we can get a small group of friends going in a totally chill, non-judgmental environment where there's less emphasis on constant meetups and more emphasis on just connecting as people, on our time, whenever we feel comfortable doing so. I'm totally fine with Skyping or having casual phone conversations when we're unable to meet in person, as well.<\/p>\n<p>One other thing: Because I do have some anxiety issues that I'm trying to overcome, I'm not too into traveling long distances for meetups, or doing anything like going to clubs or concerts. I'm just looking for something interesting and relaxing to do in Dundalk or the surrounding areas of Baltimore County, even if it's just getting something to eat or seeing a movie or going to the mall and sitting around once in a while -- and, again, as I'm more interested in genuine friendships than in \"activity partners,\" I'm totally fine with just talking on the phone once in a while or doing some online gaming or something like that. I really have no idea what this group should be, so if you have any ideas, definitely let me know. I read too many posts on sites like reddit about how people waste their 20's being lonely, and I think that if you're in that boat, let's forget what a conventional meetup is \"supposed\" to be and just try to be awesome friends.<\/p>","lon":-76.5400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183202915,"name":"Paul"},"members":198,"name":"Baltimore 20 Somethings Introverts","id":18710892,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-20-Somethings-Introverts","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Crofton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435760213000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"standard-poodles","name":"Standard Poodles","id":26808},{"urlkey":"standard-poodle-playdates","name":"Standard Poodle Playdates","id":99359},{"urlkey":"standard-poodle-play-group","name":"Standard Poodle Play Group","id":99380}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Crofton-Standard-Poodles-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Hi, woof, &amp; welcome to all the Standard Poodle owners in and around the Crofton area!!

Each moment spent dwelling on the past that is over or imagining a future that is unknown, is a moment stolen from our Life right here and now. The now is what holds the Joy, Enthusiasm, Peace, Calm, Clarity, Efficiency, Productivity. Neither at home, nor in school are we taught skills on how to live in the now. The secret to living in the now, is hidden in the breath. <br><\/p>\n<p>Come explore the breath, and experience the magic through yogic breathing taught by trained teachers from the <b>Art of Living Foundaiton<\/b>.

If you love live music, having a half price burger on a Wednesday night, and know a few good jokes join us as we meander through Baltimore, DC, and Life.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hi79oc02UFI\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/hi79oc02UFI<\/a><\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/a\/highres_440045610.jpeg","photo_id":440045610,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/a\/600_440045610.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/e\/a\/thumb_440045610.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":48628732,"name":"Katherine Jones","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/7\/d\/highres_246277501.jpeg","photo_id":246277501,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/7\/d\/member_246277501.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/2\/7\/d\/thumb_246277501.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"People Who Don't Suck and Like to Kick A$$","id":18748102,"state":"MD","urlname":"weliketokickass","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Kick A$$ers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1437216252000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"book-lovers","name":"Book lovers","id":33669},{"urlkey":"short-stories","name":"Short Stories","id":62138}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Short-Story-Book-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This meetup is for anyone who enjoys reading.

Let me know if you would like an invitation to join my team on Slack.<\/p>\n<p><b> <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>What this Meetup Group is about?<\/p>\n<p>This Group is about helping people who are in the process of learning the latest techniques in PHP development (i.e. routing, autoloading, interfaces etc.) Also, it is about uniting around a common set of PHP libraries such as PHPMailer, Smarty templating, and the Stripe payment system. We can add to the&nbsp;list later what we choose together. We will work on what I call the no_framework codebase which can be used for building any web app that handles objects in CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) fashion.<\/p>\n<p>The organiser would encourage members to join him in focusing the source code towards functionality for school bus contractors. However, I'm sure the no_framework code can be applied to improving any other person or business' workflow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>Why &nbsp;join?<\/p>\n<p>Join this group to learn and build a PHP codebase which we can share amongst ourselves. It's better when people put their efforts in a more focused endeavor. There are many PHP novices who are turned off by the prospect of learning a PHP framework. The learning curve is huge and in the end you may not agree with the way the framework does things.<\/p>\n<p> <br>What members can expect? What are typical activities? <br><\/p>\n<p>Members can expect a meetup every month or two where someone would give a small talk about the no_framework PHP project. And in between meetups individual members can stay in touch and do GitHub pull requests to help improve the no_framework codebase. Also, many who are novices to PHP may find they need parts of their project implemented in JavaScript, CSS or other front end technologies.

Our meetings include discussions, sharing own experiences - both - as facilitators\/therapists and clients, social outings, field trips, group meditations and hypnosis. <br><\/p>\n<p>Past Life Regression Therapy is based on the theory of reincarnation. It is belief that a soul survives death to be re-born again into a new body with renewed opportunity to learn life's lessons.<br><br>This powerful tool is used by even most skeptical, conservative and scientifically inclined therapists because it works regardless of our beliefs.<br>If there are no physiological or psychological reasons for your issue, then past-life exploration would be a wonderful way to uncover memory of a past trauma. Often Past Life Regression can reveal the root cause of a present symptom. Often just the matter of uncovering those memories is enough for the symptoms to disappear on it's own.<\/p>\n<p>Some people seek this kind of therapy with hopes to improve their health. Some people desire this experience out of pure curiosity. The outcome is the same - their life change in a very positive way. People are freeing them-self from pains, fears, physical conditions, gaining more understanding of who they are, improving their lives and their relationships. <br><br><br><\/p>","lon":-76.9700012207,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":150748252,"name":"Guzalia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/d\/highres_248508669.jpeg","photo_id":248508669,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/d\/member_248508669.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/d\/thumb_248508669.jpeg"}},"members":43,"name":"Eldersburg Past Life Regression Meetup","id":18797819,"state":"MD","urlname":"Eldersburg-Past-Life-Regression-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438636623000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"dads","name":"Dads","id":468},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"christianparent","name":"Christian Parenting","id":9860},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"christian-single-dads","name":"Christian Single Dads","id":22101},{"urlkey":"christian-single-moms","name":"Christian Single Moms","id":22102},{"urlkey":"single-christian-parents","name":"Single Christian Parents","id":31291},{"urlkey":"christian-support","name":"Christian Support","id":31493},{"urlkey":"christian-friendships","name":"Christian Friendships","id":111910},{"urlkey":"christian-book-discussion","name":"Christian Book Discussion","id":245501},{"urlkey":"kids-meeting-kids","name":"Kids Meeting Kids","id":655642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Raising-Kingdom-Kids-in-Baltimore\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for all Christian parents and kids!

This means, exercise is still very much on the list of requirements to succeed. It can be a challenge doing this alone if it's not been a habit. It's also a challenge to motivate yourself into improving in pace and intensity over time. As a group, exercising helps everyone. It's my vision that we will be patient with those who are slower in pace, simply because we have all been there before.<\/p>\n<p>Outings: Although the main purpose of this group is to support and exercise, I believe forming friendships and learning how to exist in the world, socially, with so many dietary restrictions, is a journey we can embark on together. There will be movies, dinner, festivals, etc. Anything that gets us out and about, and re-immersed into the world, albeit as renewed beings - hopefully.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of this group is to uplift, celebrate each other's triumphs and encourage each other into taking steps that are positive and inline with embracing this new found healthier lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you will join.<\/p>\n<p>PS <br>The restrictions to join are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1) You MUST be Pre-Op Bariatric patient with a set date for surgery.<\/p>\n<p>2) You MUST be Post-Op Bariatric patient. Whether you had your surgery yesterday or 50 years ago, is of no importance. Everyone is welcome.<\/p>\n<p>3) You MUST be uplifting and be of the mindset that promotes healthier living\/being. (No Sabotagers are welcome in this group!)<\/p>\n<p>4) Paying Dues will not be required for now, but contributions towards it would be really nice to have. I'm starting this because I feel there is a great need for it.<\/p>\n<p>5) All meetup events will be focused in the Maryland (PG\/Montgomery areas); however, meetups outside these areas will occur from time to time with the consideration of having access to FREE PARKING.<\/p>\n<p>6) I am open to suggestions for meetups and will do my best to act on them immediately. All Emails will be replied.

Adventurous. Creative. Quirky. Unique. You're an awesome friend, but you don't always get the chance to show that. Guess what? You're not alone. I've been judged for being \"different\"--left out of groups, wondering why no one seemed to understand me or like me. And I've always wanted friendships with Black women who could look beyond stereotypes and connect with the real me. You too may want those kinds of friendships. This group is the place for that. Let's have the relationships we want. Let's be the supportive, life-loving women we want to be. Let's share our stories with women who can relate and want to have fulfilling, honest friendships, too.

Please pay your dues within 3 weeks of joining (and then by Oct 1 each year after), or you will be removed from group events (especially those where paid members are on the wait list) until you pay.

We don't just show up to exchange business cards, every person who attends an event leaves with action items from the group's suggestions &amp; concerns to take back to the office\/garage for refinement.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Event formats<\/b><\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><b>Mini-Sessions: 8-12 attendees<\/b> - We test 1 project together at a time which unfolds in a tidal wave of concerns\/suggestions. This happens generally at coffee shops or restaurants for a small fee. To attend you can bring your project or just yourself (projects are never required). If you just want to check out what's new and give feedback, please attend!<\/p>\n<p><b>Large Session: 30+ attendees<\/b> <span>- These events will include a larger scale speed testing format where everyone is partner-ed up for 10 minutes. Testing begins and every 10 minutes we switch partners.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There will be larger mixers, keynotes, &amp; special testing events in the future. We look to invite experts in UI\/UX, project management, product development, mobile development, etc not to talk about their field but act as a panel of star testers that will give expert advice on individual projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Lets get Annapolis Tech moving forward, faster!<\/p>","lon":-76.5100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/c\/e\/highres_441544046.jpeg","photo_id":441544046,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/c\/e\/600_441544046.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/c\/e\/thumb_441544046.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":111643432,"name":"Jordan Westfall","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/c\/1\/highres_249313249.jpeg","photo_id":249313249,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/c\/1\/member_249313249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/3\/c\/1\/thumb_249313249.jpeg"}},"members":31,"name":"Beta BOOST (Annapolis)","id":18889041,"state":"MD","urlname":"Beta-BOOST-Annapolis","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":39,"who":"Co-Testers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Catonsville","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441120528000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"single-moms","name":"Single Moms","id":16264},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"new-moms-support-group","name":"New Moms Support","id":81674},{"urlkey":"single-moms-support","name":"Single Moms Support","id":95759},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Catonsville-Working-Moms-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"This group is to provide community for working parents.

We are a service club that significantly improves lives in our local community and around the world by meeting real needs. Our vision \"We will make a positive difference for youth today, so they will make a difference tomorrow.\" Rotary\u2019s guiding principle is Service Above Self. Rotarians develop community service projects that address many of today's most critical issues---children at risk, health &amp;amp; hunger, water and literacy. We support programs for youth; educational opportunities and international exchanges for students and professionals; and vocational and career development and much more. Our Club's signature project is the Books for International Goodwill, Inc. which takes used books for shipment to needy schools and libraries, and since 1995, has saved books from the landfill and shipped over 5 million books to help spread literacy throughout the world.

Gay men face common gay stereotypes and clich\u00e9s, not just from the straight world but also from our own \u201cgay community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span>By \"gay scene,\" I mean gay bars, gay restaurants, \"LGBT(Q)\" political meetings, gay pride parades, gay brunches, and drag shows. &nbsp;In the gay scene, you meet the same kinds of gay people (clich\u00e9 gays also known as \"basic gays,\" doing the same things (like going to drag shows) over and over again. &nbsp;So as a non-scene group, we do not do these things as a group. We set ourselves apart and we have events away from the scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We are also not part of \"gay culture.\" This is not a group for guys who call themselves \"queer\" or \"girl\" or who are over-the-top or provocative and who find female pop artists and fashion really important. Some gay men like rock music and sports. This group is&nbsp;for gay guys who do not act like stereotypical black females and do not think mockery of them is funny (it's actually racist), for whom camp is not their typical humor, who are not exaggeratedly feminine, and who do not frequent gay bars.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for gay guys who identify as masculine and normal. Recently, transgender men have come to dominate gay media outlets, confusing people into perceiving transgender men to be gay men. Transgender is not the same as gay. We support transgender rights, however, most gay men are not men who want to be women. We are gay and bi men who like being men.<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for gay guys who are seeking new friends to hang with, go to movies with, and have dinners with, away from the gay scene. &nbsp;I think these kinds of gay guys are the <i>majority<\/i> of gay men, but people may not perceive that to be so, because popular culture and gay culture perpetuate and reinforce gay stereotypes and cliches. &nbsp;Here is&nbsp;<span>social space that connects normal gay guys offline, in real life, at places other than gay bars, such as coffee shops, private homes, sports events, and restaurants.&nbsp;<\/span><span>Unlike the common cliche gays, we won\u2019t be wearing purple wigs in this group and posting the pics on Facebook or Meetup. We're not like that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last, this group is not about hooking up with other guys, which is also another common stereotype of gay men. Being gay is mostly not about sex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking for something different from the gay scene that defines and limits so many gay guys, then this group is for you. Non-Scene Gay Guys is for gay and bi men in their 20s, 30s, and a few in their 40s, who have interests outside of gay culture and want to hang out, make friends, and have fun, doing social activities away from the gay scene.

We are proud members of the Barbershop Harmony Society (officially the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of BarberShop Quartet Singing in America, Inc., or SPEBSQSA). The chorus performs a diverse repertoire of American popular music, including Tin Pan Alley classics, pop standards, novelty songs, and seasonal favorites. We complement our singing with innovative staging, movement, and dialogue, to create a unique and memorable experience for our audiences. All of our music is arranged for four voice parts and sung a cappella (unaccompanied). The male singers in our group come from various musical backgrounds, having sung in high school and college a cappella groups, madrigals, church choirs, opera, musical theater, and even heavy metal bands. We are a volunteer organization. The men who sing with us are regular guys from all professions...executives, teachers, engineers, physicians, military, skilled laborers, and more. They come from Baltimore and Washington, DC, and everywhere in between. The Sons of the Severn name is an homage to the Severn River, which runs through Annapolis, the state capital of Maryland and home to the United States Naval Academy. The chorus represents the Anne Arundel County, Maryland Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Our chapter was founded in 1949, the third chapter to charter in the Society's Mid-Atlantic District.<\/p>","lon":-76.5100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192388470,"name":"S David Bankard Sr.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/highres_249867555.jpeg","photo_id":249867555,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/member_249867555.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/3\/thumb_249867555.jpeg"}},"members":11,"name":"A.A.

Currently, we have a 5th edition D&amp;amp;D game and a Fantasy Age (generalization of the Dragon Age RPG) game. The D&amp;amp;D game has been running for a while, and is set in a Tiefling-run analog of the Roman Empire, and explores issues of power, responsibility, and exploration. The Fantasy Age game (which has just started) has an early Renaissance feel and is concerned with secret societies.

We'll discuss what we read and how we might apply what we are learning to the way we show up as professionals and enhance how we tackle our own work.<\/p>","lon":-77.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/7\/c\/highres_444890044.jpeg","photo_id":444890044,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/7\/c\/600_444890044.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/7\/c\/thumb_444890044.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185792411,"name":"Kinsey ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/c\/highres_250856444.jpeg","photo_id":250856444,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/c\/member_250856444.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/7\/c\/thumb_250856444.jpeg"}},"members":30,"name":"Petworth Readers: Org Development & Change Leadership","id":19061067,"state":"DC","urlname":"Petworth-Readers-Org-Development-Change-Leadership","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":38.9500007629,"who":"Leaders & Readers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Laurel","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445873104000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"astrology","name":"Astrology","id":218},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"psychics","name":"Psychics","id":1523},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"metaphysics-and-astrology","name":"Metaphysics and Astrology","id":46313}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SoulPrenuers\/","rating":4,"description":"This group is for the \"heart centered entrepreneurs\" ... it may sound corny hahaha and not saying that other entrepreneurs aren't \"heart centered\" but I'm speaking to those of us who some may call \"light workers\".

Just being silent and ignoring the political system in Baltimore is not acceptable. This group we will empower women to run for city\/county office and\/or working on campaigns.  Men outnumber women in these roles by significant margins.\n\nFact: In the 110th Congress, we had a record number of women chairing committees, but that record is still only six chairs, out of roughly 40 committees.

Join me January 16, 2016 for our first meetup scheduled alongside our one year anniversary! Look for our next meetup coming to D.C and VA - keeping my promise to establish meetups in the DMV area. Please share. We need your support!!<\/p>\n<p>Who We Are: &lt;br&gt;<\/p>\n<p>We are a group of black women coming together to support, empower and fellowship while moving forward. We will meet to share, have fun, cry, laugh and grow. We will have various events and empowerment meetings and sharing sessions. Each Villager must make a vow upon joining. It's simple, you must vow to help at least one Villager in some form or fashion while a member of the group. This could be by way of encouraging, mentoring, praying or any way you feel that inspires or brings a smile on the face of another. This group's mission is to enjoy life and each other while having fun while moving forward. *This Meetup is an extension of the Charlotte (NC) Black Women Widows Moving Forward Meetup and The Strong Black Women Grieve Blog and Facebook communities below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com\">www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>LET'S MOVE FORWARD!<\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/highres_444131677.jpeg","photo_id":444131677,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/600_444131677.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/thumb_444131677.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":104588872,"name":"Sabra Robinson","photo":{"photo_id":136301712,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/f\/0\/member_136301712.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/2\/f\/0\/thumb_136301712.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"Baltimore Black Women Widows Moving Forward","id":19103406,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Black-Women-Widows-Moving-Forward","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Baltimore BWW Villagers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447041785000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"internet-of-things","name":"Internet of Things","id":79740},{"urlkey":"wearable-art","name":"Wearable Art","id":83650},{"urlkey":"wearable-technologies","name":"Wearable Technologies","id":454182},{"urlkey":"smart-sensors","name":"Smart Sensors","id":871222},{"urlkey":"smartwatches","name":"Smartwatches","id":1476262},{"urlkey":"smartwatch","name":"Smartwatch","id":1484772},{"urlkey":"smartbands","name":"Smartbands","id":1484792},{"urlkey":"wearables","name":"Wearables","id":1484812},{"urlkey":"pebble","name":"Pebble","id":1504263}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/D-C-Wearables-meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A (soon to be) series of regular meetings covering the latest trends and developments in the wearable technology industry.

creative. Get away from your busy, over-committed life for a couple of hours and share some time relaxing, socializing and creating with other women. This is a place to explore your creative self in a fun and supportive atmosphere. All skill levels are welcome, from those who mistakenly think they are not creative to those artistic, crafty women who want to get back to creating. We will meet every Thursday evening at Catylator Makerspace, a gorgeous facility in downtown Silver Spring. Each week we will pick a project or craft to complete, such as chalk painting, jewelry making or paper crafting, based on the interests and requests from the group. Come just when a project interests you, or come every week for the fun and social aspects. We will have light refreshments, but bring your own wine :). All supplies will be included, and there will be a fee for each class which will cover materials and the rental of the space.","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185070044,"name":"kathryn neel"},"members":257,"name":"Women's Upscale Craft Studio","id":19124372,"state":"MD","urlname":"Womens-Upscale-Craft-Studio","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":39,"who":"Artists and Crafters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447620577000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-marriage-minded","name":"Christian Singles Marriage Minded","id":15378},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"divorced-single-never-married-christian-singles","name":"Divorced,Single,Never Married Christian Singles","id":25392},{"urlkey":"christian-women","name":"Christian Women","id":31382},{"urlkey":"christian-single-events","name":"Christian Single Events","id":63228},{"urlkey":"christian-dating-and-relationships","name":"Christian Dating and Relationships","id":72415},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-and-singles-again","name":"Christian Singles and Singles Again","id":103825},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-social-networking","name":"Christian Singles Social Networking","id":151244}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DMV-Single-Christian-Ladies-Network\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Calling all Single Christian Ladies! \"As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend\" (Proverbs 27:17)...

We genuinely want to connect with local people that are enthusiastic about Holistic Health, Spirituality, Raising Consciousness and Healing. Our Facility is currently in its build out phase and our grand opening is in March of 2016. In the mean time we are reaching out and letting people know that there is a Community and Wellness Center in the area open to you, offering you a way to make deep connections!<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.journeywithin.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.journeywithin.com<\/a><\/p>","lon":-76.8499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/4\/highres_445202660.jpeg","photo_id":445202660,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/4\/600_445202660.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/4\/thumb_445202660.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183022175,"name":"Farhan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/8\/5\/highres_242265189.jpeg","photo_id":242265189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/8\/5\/member_242265189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/8\/5\/thumb_242265189.jpeg"}},"members":136,"name":"Journey Within Wellness Center","id":19222576,"state":"MD","urlname":"Journey-Within-Wellness-Center","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.1699981689,"who":"Journeyers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Bowie","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450536139000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"specialed","name":"Special Education","id":1677},{"urlkey":"adhd","name":"ADHD","id":12126},{"urlkey":"adults-with-add","name":"Adults with ADD","id":16533},{"urlkey":"adults-with-adhd","name":"Adults with ADHD","id":16534},{"urlkey":"families-of-children-who-have-add-adhd","name":"Families of Children who have ADD\/ADHD","id":17457},{"urlkey":"adult-add-hd","name":"Adult ADD\/HD","id":18052},{"urlkey":"resources-for-adhd","name":"Resources for ADHD","id":20648},{"urlkey":"adhd-parents-with-adhd-children","name":"ADHD Parents with ADHD Children","id":33264},{"urlkey":"parents-of-children-with-adhd","name":"Parents of Children with ADHD","id":45403},{"urlkey":"support-groups-for-parents-with-adhd-children","name":"Support Groups for Parents with ADHD Children","id":52409},{"urlkey":"add-adhd-support","name":"ADD\/ADHD Support","id":98013},{"urlkey":"adults-adhd-support-group","name":"Adults ADHD Support Group","id":108503},{"urlkey":"adhd-support","name":"ADHD Support","id":191391}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bowie-Special-Education-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Need someone to talk to that can relate to what you are going through?

Stay mentally sharp! Have fun! Meet new people with a common goal! Stop being a chair potato as social events! Learn the line dances without judgement nor stress. Line dancing regularly and some knee pains and aching muscles may go away, too. Beginners are especially invited to the class and of course, more advanced dancers, too. No one knows all of the line dances but hoofers will learn so many of them. Train and learn with an experienced dancer, experienced line dancer and choreographer of ten years. Learning popular line dance songs in class and practicing at home improves the heart rate, can help breathing, &nbsp;does improve concentration, is very social, can make you sweat which is good for the skin, and is great all around exercise. The home practice is great,also, because practice makes perfect. The class is held only one hour a week, right now, and you do not want to forget what you learn from week to week. The class is not just for women but for men, too. When you learn that new dance that you have seen, you begin to feel good about yourself, &nbsp;boosting self-esteem a bit so smile. &nbsp; You should begin to dance because you feel it and soon will learn not to dance to the steps of the dance but to the you in you. Your feet will know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>In the class, hoofers will learn to pivot, slide, step and more. All a hoofer really needs to know is how to count from 1 to4 and 5 to 8 and, as someone said, left from right.<\/p>\n<p>For the class, no equipment is needed. Comfortable shoes are a must,...flats, dance shoes or heels. To provide easier spins and pivots and to use shoes on most types of floors, having suede soles on regular shoes is a good idea. One other suggestion is that a towel might come in handy since some dances, like cardio aerobics, can be real workouts. You see, adding to the advantages of line dancing above, line dancing does increase the heart rate, can improve breathing, can remove pain from sore joints, does increase blood flow and can improve memory. The &nbsp;more you dance, the more you feel and see the many results.<\/p>","lon":-76.7399978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192743006,"name":"Elner","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/highres_252282371.jpeg","photo_id":252282371,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/member_252282371.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/thumb_252282371.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"DANCE-B HEALTHY 4 LIFE","id":19230177,"state":"MD","urlname":"DANCE-B-HEALTHY-4-LIFE","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":39.3300018311,"who":"Hoofers, Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Columbia","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450733480000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"asexuality","name":"Asexuality","id":3534},{"urlkey":"seniors","name":"Seniors","id":4107},{"urlkey":"intimacy","name":"Intimacy","id":15187},{"urlkey":"over-50","name":"Over 50","id":16559},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"sexual-education","name":"Sexual Education","id":20591},{"urlkey":"sexuality-awareness","name":"Sexuality Awareness","id":32303},{"urlkey":"active-seniors","name":"Active Seniors","id":87006}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Over-50-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a discussion group for seniors 50 + who have lost their sexual mo-jo or it has gone to sleep.

It's doable! The Nixon administration got a UBI bill all the way to Congress. The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is conducting a UBI experiment in 2016 (and experiments were done previously in a few cities around the world, including in the US and Canada).

We begin with a brief meditation and end with a short kirtan. The facilitator ensures that the discussion stays on track and is the best utilization of everyone\u2019s time. If you are looking to enhance your knowledge of the Gita and wanting to implement its teachings in your life, do join us, and we promise we will make you feel at home","lon":-76.7699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197490428,"name":"Subash"},"members":3,"name":"Bhagawad Gita Study Meetup DC Maryland Virgina","id":19257719,"state":"MD","urlname":"Bhagawad-Gita-Study-Meetup-DC-Maryland-Virgina","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Bhagavad Gita Knowledge Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451682136000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"single-moms","name":"Single Moms","id":16264}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-Moms-Of-Tweens\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This Meetup is for single moms of Tweens with either shared or sole custody who are interested in forming lasting friendships and find support in raising healthy and happy children.

This is a group where Christian women will meet once a month at the Bowie Town Center and watch a movie (Regal Bowie Stadium 14) and get a bite to eat afterwards. Keep in mind that I am open to doing other things and going other places but because I am currently not driving, Bowie Town Center is the most convenient location for me at this time. If you have any other suggestions, let me know (and prepare to let me hitch a ride lol)! Throughout the rest of the month, we will keep in touch with each other via text, social media, in person, etc. The goal is for us to hold each other accountable, provide a listening ear and to become prayer partners. Additionally, an informal \"bible study\" will be held once a week, where I will send an email to each member providing my bible study notes during my devotional time for that week. My purpose in creating this group is to form a dynamic group of Christian sisters who are on fire for the Lord.

My 2015 board was so powerful I asked the Universe to power down a bit by September! Are you ready to create the life you truly want? Tired of saying \"I will do that someday...\" and never getting around to it? If so, or if you simply need an excuse to come hang out with me while doing something awesome for yourself, please come to the vision board workshop I'm leading at Grace in Silver Spring on January 17 from 2:00-4:30 pm. I will lead a guided meditation to help you connect with your heart's desires, offer time to journal and set goals for your life and provide all the supplies you need to create your vision board. I recommend bringing a photo of yourself along with any other pictures or images that are important to you to affix to your board.

For folks 30 and older, one big challenge is just finding like-minded people, which is why I started this group. This is an opportunity to study independently, while in the same place (or boat), an empowering type of 'peer pressure.' I'll find good study spots -- primarily in Montgomery County, e.g., Silver Spring, Takoma Park, Bethesda. Each meetup will begin with introductions, then a timed independent study period of about 1.5 hours. At the 1.5 hour mark, the group will check in, sharing current progress and goals for the coming week. After the check-in, group members can continue studying and\/or leave individually when finished -- no set end time if the study space is still available. This format can also be changed\/improved. Join a group of people (or \"accountability partners\") committed to similar goals, with the usual competing obligations of a mature student.","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2326830,"name":"Michelle Blair","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/d\/c\/highres_252647068.jpeg","photo_id":252647068,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/d\/c\/member_252647068.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/d\/c\/thumb_252647068.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Second Career STEM Study Group - DC-MD-VA","id":19290422,"state":"MD","urlname":"Second-Career-STEM-Study-Group-DC-MD-VA","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":39,"who":"Study Gurus"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Baltimore","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452124299000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"italian-food","name":"Italian Food","id":15027},{"urlkey":"pizza","name":"Pizza","id":23326},{"urlkey":"dinner","name":"Dinner","id":40569},{"urlkey":"social-events-dining-out","name":"Social Events & Dining Out","id":77639},{"urlkey":"where-is-the-best-pizza-in-town","name":"Where is the best pizza in town?","id":150790},{"urlkey":"pizza-lovers","name":"Pizza Lovers","id":959452},{"urlkey":"american-pizza-lovers","name":"American Pizza Lovers","id":959472},{"urlkey":"best-slice-of-pizza","name":"Best Slice of Pizza","id":959482},{"urlkey":"pizza-foodies","name":"Pizza Foodies","id":959492},{"urlkey":"socializing-friendship","name":"Socializing & Friendship","id":1420882}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Pizza-Lovers-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for people who love pizza.
