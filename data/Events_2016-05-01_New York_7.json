comparing Chilean wine to a Volvo\u2014safe but boring.\u00a0 He has since expressed regret for that comment, but perhaps he had a point.\u00a0 For much of the wine-drinking public, Chile is a source of moderately priced, inoffensively drinkable, and universally available wines made from familiar European varietals.\u00a0 Nothing to make a face about and spit out, but nothing to get excited about either.<\/p> <p>But is there more to Chilean wine than the mass-produced Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc that you probably drank at your last wedding reception, theater intermission, or coach-class flight?<\/p> <p>Chile has a number of viticultural advantages.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the few wine-producing regions that have remained phylloxera-free, so Vinifera grapes can be planted ungrafted on their own rootstocks.\u00a0 It has a Mediterranean climate, sheltered by the Andes to the east and the Pacific coastal ranges to the west.\u00a0 Mountain snowmelt makes irrigation easy.\u00a0 And the varied terrain and climate, from the flat Central Valley, to the high-altitude vineyards of Aconcagua, to the cool Pacific regions of Casablanca and San Antonio, provide an optimal growing environment for a wide variety of high-quality grapes.<\/p> <p>A new generation of cosmopolitan winemakers has started focusing on quality over quantity, planting a range of grape varieties in terroirs where they can excel.\u00a0 And Carmen\u00e8re (once widely misidentified as Merlot) has become Chile\u2019s answer to Argentina\u2019s Malbec\u2014a trademark Chilean varietal that can produce outstanding, distinctive wines when carefully made, keeping its typical meaty, smoky qualities under control.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/1\/8\/600_448408440.jpeg\" \/> From north to south, Chile\u2019s major winemaking regions:<\/p> <p><i>Limar\u00ed Valley<\/i> \u2014 For the most part this region, north of Santiago and close to the Atacama Desert, is hot and dry.\u00a0 But vineyards are planted close to the Pacific Coast, where they benefit from cool morning fogs and ocean breezes.\u00a0 Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Syrah are the specialties here. \u00a0We\u2019ll be trying a Limar\u00ed Pinot Noir (an unusual varietal at this latitude) as well as a Chardonnay aged for 11 months in French oak.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see if the unique limestone soils of the region produce Burgundian results.<\/p> <p><i>Aconcagua Valley<\/i> \u2014 Named for the highest peak in the Western Hemisphere, this region, also north of Santiago, is one of Chile\u2019s hottest.\u00a0 But again, proximity to the coast and vineyard altitude are key.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying one of the great Cabernet blends of Chile (obtained for a bargain price), the Errazuriz Don Maximiano Founder\u2019s Reserve.\u00a0 Its mint and mineral notes are hallmarks of cool-climate Cabernet.<\/p> <p><i>Casablanca and San Antonio Valleys<\/i> \u2014 Considered subregions of Aconcagua, these are cool-climate coastal regions that specialize in white wines.\u00a0 There are wide temperature shifts between day and night and a long growing season, which make for ripe Chardonnays and Sauvignon Blancs that retain their acidity.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Sauvignon Blanc by Matetic, a highly regarded biodynamic winemaker in San Antonio.<\/p> <p><i>Maipo Valley<\/i> \u2014 South of Santiago and at the north end of the extensive Central Valley, the Maipo Valley is the original home of Chilean viticulture.\u00a0 It\u2019s considered the Bordeaux of South America, focusing on Cabernet and blends, with the higher-altitude vineyards of Alto Maipo producing the best quality.\u00a0 (Many of Chile\u2019s prestige wines are made in Alto Maipo, such as Almaviva and Don Melchor.)\u00a0 Perhaps because of its proximity to Santiago, many of Chile\u2019s mega-wineries, such as Concha y Toro, Cousi\u00f1o Macul, and Santa Rita, are headquartered in Maipo.<\/p> <p><i>Rapel Valley<\/i> \u2014 In between the Andes and the Coastal Range, this is a large region of the Central Valley, further subdivided into the Cachapoal and Colchagua Valleys.\u00a0 Cachapoal, to the north, has well-drained vineyards to the east in the foothills of the Andes.\u00a0 To the south, Colchagua\u2019s vineyards are concentrated in the west, with the cooling influence of the Pacific.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be comparing reds from each of these two subregions\u2014from Cachapoal, the Sideral Bordeaux blend from the Vi\u00f1a San Pedro (maker of ultra-premium Alta\u00efr), and from Colchagua, Purple Angel from Vi\u00f1a Montes.\u00a0 Montes is a respected, modern winemaker and Purple Angel is often considered the standard-bearer for Chilean Carmen\u00e8re.\u00a0 But it can be a polarizing wine\u2014rave review from the <i>Spectator<\/i> (93 score), but lukewarm reviews from UK-based Jancis Robinson.\u00a0 A previous vintage was dismissed by her site as \u201cover the top, clich\u00e9 US-market stuff.\u201d\u00a0 Ouch!\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what we think.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Curic\u00f3 Valley<\/i> \u2014 A workhorse region south of Rapel, known mainly for value-priced Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc, neither of which tend to achieve the quality found in the more northerly regions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Maule Valley<\/i> \u2014 The southernmost major wine region of Chile (only the up-and-coming B\u00edo-B\u00edo and Malleco are farther south), this is a large area that has long been known more for quantity than quality.\u00a0 But there are pockets of world-class winemaking, particularly using rare old vines that have been saved amid the push for modernity in this region.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying an earthy, old-vines Malbec blend by De Martino, which focuses on traditional, Old World\u2013style winemaking.<\/p> <p>In keeping with the South American theme of the tasting, we\u2019ll be dining at Balvanera on the Lower East Side, where the menu features imported Argentine and Uruguayan beef.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.balvaneranyc.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.balvaneranyc.com\/\"

It has a very classical nose, a Bordeaux blend with aromas of blackberries, faint balsamic notes, cedar wood, graphite, cigar box, cracked peppercorns, and tobacco leaves. It has a lot less new oak than the vintages of yesteryear. The palate is medium to full-bodied with the telltale Cabernet tannins, juicy fruit, and tension keeping the freshness balancing the sweet fruit. One of the finest versions of Don Maximiano.<\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 17\/20<\/i> \u2013 Dark luscious purplish crimson colour. Freshness is the watchword on the nose, as opposed to the rich ripeness of the Maipo Cabs. Quite subtle and a bit minty. Tannins very well managed. Well put together. But it\u2019s pretty muscular as opposed to fleshy. Dry tea-leaf flavours on the finish. Should make old bones.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2012 Vi\u00f1a Montes Purple Angel Carmen\u00e8re<\/b> <b>(Rapel, Colchagua Valley)\u00a0 $50 (sale price, reg. $65)<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Spectator 93<\/i>\u2013Suave and plush, with a broad, open texture that transmits a spicy array of dark cherry, currant, blackberry, and cocoa powder notes. Very creamy, with silky tannins on the finish of Asian spice and chocolate. Drink now through 2022.<\/p> <p>Jancis Robinson 15\/20 \u2013 Super fruity\u2014rich, ripe, bold. Medicinal flavours add some variation but this is a heavy, dense style that tires quickly.<\/p> <p><b>2011 De Martino Old Bush Vines Single Vineyard Limavida (Maule Valley)\u00a0 $15 (sale price, reg. $37)<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Single Vineyard Limavida is produced with the fruit from a 2.3-hectare, ungrafted, dry-farmed, old vineyard from Maule planted back in 1945 with mixed varieties, mainly Malbec (around 80%) and other red grapes, mainly Carmen\u00e8re and Cabernet Sauvignon on granitic soils. It displays a bright ruby color with strong aromas of flowers (the telltale violets that the best Malbec really masters) and notes of aniseed, red fruit, licorice, smoked hints and the tension and acidity from the old vines with fine-grained tannins. With time in the glass, it develops a beautiful orange peel note that makes it appealing and fresh. A serious red from Maule.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan.\u00a0\u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014<\/p> <p><br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014 \u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all.

I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!!

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

Bewildered and devastated that her dogs could have committed such violence, she worries that she might suffer from one of the syndromes she studies: pathological altruism, when selfless acts do more damage than good.<\/p> <p>When Morgan tries to locate Bennett\u2019s parents to tell them about their son\u2019s hideous death, she discovers he was not the man he said he was. Everything he has told her\u2014where he was born, where he lives and works\u2014was a lie. In fact, he has several fianc\u00e9es, and fits the clinical definition of a sociopath.

Comes with up to 5 of the free toppings.<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________<br\/>See you there. Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/230356849\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvgbzb","time":1461103200000,"updated":1461115743000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"go to eventbrite","name":"Eventbrite","lon":-74.005943,"id":24358191,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460495621000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please make sure to RSVP on Eventbrite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/adapting-to-the-future-of-content-creation-and-marketing-tickets-24605503724\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/adapting-to-the-future-of-content-creation-and-marketing-tickets-24605503724<\/a><\/p> <p>First there was radio, then TV took over radio, and now according to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, \"Apps are the Next TV.\" Whoever would have though record studios would go out of business with musicians being able to sell direct?<br\/>At this Meetup we will have a presentation about the important media trends that are not only bound to grow but also bound to dominate.

Apache Spark makes it easy to build analytics over large scale data sets. NVIDIA GPUs provide the computational power for machine and deep learning challenges.<\/p> <p>However, It is non-trivial to exploit the power of GPUs and scale applications onto multi-core, parallel architectures. GPU algorithms not only require significant expertise to develop, but also intimate knowledge of the CPU and GPU memory systems, and detailed knowledge of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), Writing fast, efficient data analytics for graph and machine learning on GPUs can be hard due to the complexities of CUDA and achieving effective parallelism.<\/p> <p>DASL and SPARQL are high-level languages for graph and machine learning algorithms (DASL) and graph pattern matching (SPARQL) that provide speedups of up to 1,000x over Spark native and up to 300x over leading graph databases when executed on the BlazeGraph platform.<\/p> <p>We will present Blazegraph GPU benchmarking results against our SPARQL-enabled, non-GPU Blazegraph platform over the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) and Berlin Sparql Benchmark (BSBM) demonstrating[masked]X speed-up. Users of the RDF\/SPARQL API are able to achieve this acceleration simply by changing to the GPU-enabled platform without underlying code or application changes.<\/p> <p>We will present Blazegraph DASL (pronounced 'dazzle') for graph and predictive analytics that combines the ease of Spark with the speed of GPUs. It has shown 1000X acceleration for large graphs when compared to in-memory processing with GraphX. DASL is a Scala-based language provides graphs and machine learning algorithms over linear algebra primitives. DASL programs are translated into task graphs that expose the available parallelism. The underlying Blazegraph DASL runtime integrates closely with Apache Spark. It provides the ability to write and execute DASL programs in Apache Spark and delivers a distributed, scalable architecture for machine learning and graph algorithms on GPUs and GPU clusters within the Spark environment.<\/p> <p><b>Brad Bebee, Chief Executive Officer, Blazegraph<\/b><\/p> <p>Brad is the CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.Blazegraph.com\">Blazegraph<\/a> leading efforts to deliver graphs at scale with Blazegraph products.

Ajay developed the concept for a new app to help connect people looking for a place to live with those looking for a roommate. He wrote the code himself until he could afford his first employee. Since then, he\u2019s guided Roomi through its debut in New York and expansion to California, Pennsylvania and Texas, with other markets and services<\/p> <p>Before Roomi, Ajay studied computer science at NYIT and helped to launch two other startups. Ajay also serves as a Lean Startup Machine mentor, advising early\u00ad stage startups during crucial growth points. He loves working with people who are also passionate about building a better world, and he strives to lead by example.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after.

Also, feel free to use the messaging system on our Meetup page to find scene partners or share material with those who have RSVPed to a session.<\/p> <p>PPS. We also have a piano for use in Musical Theatre type projects :)<\/p> <p>Thanks Everyone and see you soon!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ActingGym\/events\/229988206\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"April Showers Bring Actors to the Gym 3!","id":"229988206","time":1461106800000,"updated":1461121997000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431057737000,"name":"New York Actors Gym","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18582668,"urlname":"ActingGym","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Actors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"440 9th Ave","name":"Hudson Station","lon":-73.995621,"id":19685152,"lat":40.753841,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.396924674511,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459267441000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This is for the single women in our\u00a0group\u00a0of all professions and any men who are legitimate Fire or EMS employees.\u00a0Mix &amp; mingle with NY's bravest!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Snag\u00a0your very own hero at this singles Meetup which gathers the city's hottest FIREMEN &amp; EMT at one of NYC's hottest places! \u00a0Our\u00a0last mixer had 100+ attend!\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>*MUST GET TICKET IN ADVANCE HERE -\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/fireman\/dates\/Apr-19-2016_at_0700PM\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/fireman\/dates\/Apr-19-2016_at_0700PM\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dljparty.ticketleap.com\/fireman\/dates\/Apr-19-2016_at_0700PM<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>*Prepay Only Event.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Do you think eating organic, vegan, or raw\/living food is all you need in your diet to stay healthy? Even most organic food is sadly lacking in nutrients these days, and most raw food supplements and \"superfoods\" contain mold and often do not even contain what is listed on their labels. But all is NOT lost! There are ways to revert GMO DNA in plants and animals back to the original non-GMO forms, and heal GMO damage in the body. Ken Rohla will show you how to test your own food in your own kitchen to see for yourself what you are actually eating, or rather, what you're not! But what can you do about nutrient depleted organic food that comprises the majority of what's available to us? No matter how limited your space, time, or money, Ken will show you specifically how you can grow, ferment, sprout, and create your own superfoods, supplements, and medicines beyond organic, beyond biodynamic, for massive nutrition and healing power.

AJ and the Didge Project team are wonderful teachers, great people to be around, and their teaching style is very diverse. The didgeridoo is the first instrument I really enjoy playing because it is so profoundly basic and yet engages you physically and spiritually in complex and fascinating ways. I was actually surprised how quickly I could learn to make sounds and rhythms. The classes are clearly structured and methodical, lots of hands-on practice and personal guidance. I am now playing didge in yoga classes and people absolutely love the experience of its healing earth vibrations. I highly recommend any group classes or private sessions with Didge Project, please check it out and embark on a journey into peaceful sound!<br\/>\u2013 Nora Heilmann, Jivamukti Yoga teacher NYC<\/p> <p>I\u2019m into healthy lifestyle. I like to meditate and do other practices to help my health. That\u2019s why playing the didgeridoo for sleep apnea is a wonderful thing for a person like me. It incorporates my interest in musicianship and world cultures.\u00a0 I thought it was going to be difficult but it really isn\u2019t\u2026 I would really encourage you.

Neil will be discussing lighting and posing for on location portraits.<\/p> <p>When shooting on location, we don\u2019t always have the luxury of ideal settings and conditions. So we have to make it work!<\/p> <p>Learn some practical steps to develop and achieve consistency with your on-location portrait photography. Neil will discuss real-world practical building blocks you can use to help you when challenged by tough lighting scenarios. Refine your technique and also define your own style in portrait photography. No vague feel-good fluff here, but actual info you can use!<\/p> <p>By looking at the thought-process in how we set up an on-location shoot, we\u2019ll look at posing and specifically the lighting (whether available light is enough or additional lighting is needed). We will look at all the factors that have to come together for a successful portrait and a consistent style.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------<\/p> <p>ABOUT NEIL:<br\/>Neil van Niekerk is a photographer based in northern NJ, specializing in portrait and wedding photography.<\/p> <p>\"I\u2019m originally from South Africa where I worked as a TV Broadcast Engineer. Then in 2000, my wife and I decided to settle in the USA with our daughter \u2013 and I have pursued photography here as a full time career since. In addition to working with my clients, I have written five books on photography, two of which have been translated into other languages. I also maintain a popular website for photographers and I teach workshops on photography. I really love what I do! I get real pleasure from sharing the happiness with the people that I photograph, and knowing that I\u2019m creating images that will evoke wonderful memories for a lifetime.\"<\/p> <p>Neil has also presented workshops on lighting, in the USA and the UK and Ireland. In addition to that, <a href=\"http:\/\/neilvn.com\/tangents\/about\/books\/\">Neil has written several books on lighting and flash photography<\/a>. He also maintains a website for photographers, <a href=\"http:\/\/neilvn.com\/tangents\/\">Tangents<\/a>, which is loaded with tutorials. His wedding photography can be seen on his blog: <a href=\"http:\/\/oneperfectmoment.com\/\">One Perfect Moment<\/a>.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"When you enter the complex we are located in the building on the right.

Our group meets once a month; we gently critique each other\u2019s work, but our main focus is on helping each other get published. There is no charge for this workshop; we ask only that you commit to meeting once a month, reading the work of the other members and offering your suggestions for improvement in an upbeat, encouraging manner.<\/p> <p><b>What do we mean by \u201cadvanced writers?\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p>We mean those writers who are close to being published or have already been published in some form. We also mean writers who, we can see by reading samples of their writing, have great potential but until now have not been mentored or encouraged to treat their work seriously or to aim for publication.<\/p> <p><b>How do you know if you fit our criteria for a writer with promise?<\/b><\/p> <p>You don\u2019t. Writers are often poor judges of the level of their talent. We suggest that you give us the opportunity to judge that, because we can often sense that spark of talent even if you yourself do not. Additionally, we have recently instituted a new member category, dubbed \u201cApprentice author\u201d--individuals who demonstrate potential but who have not yet been published anywhere or achieved commercial capability.<\/p> <p><b>Submit a Sample<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are interested in joining this kind of a close and involved group of writers, submit a sample of your writing (15 pages or less) to the group,plus a personal letter telling us a little about your background, what you are aiming for and what you think we can do for you. Your sample submission may be a play, fiction or non-fiction. If fiction, it can be a short story or a chapter of a book. If non-fiction, the sample can be an article or a chapter of a non-fiction book. If a play, send only Act One.<\/p> <p>If you are accepted into the group, we ask only that you encourage and support each group member by reading his or her material, critiquing it in a kindly, professional manner and attend our monthly meeting to discuss it in a group setting. There is no charge whatsoever for membership in the Advanced Writers Group. Our goal is to encourage more good secular writers to enter the literary marketplace.<\/p> <p>Bear in mind that once you are accepted, everyone in the group accepts that you are headed for publication; this is not a \u201clearn to write\u201d group. This is a group whose members have shown themselves to have solid skills and need only minimum critiquing or, more importantly, encouragement in tackling the publishing industry, which, when done alone, can be discouraging.

In turn, our credibility as an organization becomes more valuable to the public by providing them with an outlet to be heard.<\/p> <p><br\/>Getting involved is easy to do and the data collection is very accurate. Users simply register their info, and begin mapping the trees around them. \u00a0At the basic level, they take a photo, measure the circumference (or diameter), and enter the tree species. OTM uses the USDA\u2019s i-tree software to automatically generate various eco-benefits, which we then present as cost-befits to funders and city agencies.<\/p> <p><br\/>After the primary information is entered, users have the option to enter alerts such as: \u201cneeds water\u201d \u201ctree has been topped\u201d \u201cdead tree\u201d etc. They can also add information about the planting sides: \u201cempty tree pit\u201d \u201cneeds concrete removal\u201d \u201cremove trash\u201d. \u00a0After stewardship tasks have been completed, anyone can click back on that pin and record the actions taken. In the end, this process embodies the idea that the most effective way to bring about change is not by empty complaints or government handouts, but a combination of top-down support and bottom-up expertise.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n8:15p -\u00a0Projects\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/14MI6N50aQkMPybmlv8FJjvKFJ-vWB8VWm8leRWzdwFA\/edit#gid=0\">List<\/a>\u00a0+\u00a0<b>Working Session<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeforamerica.org\/brigade\/tools\/\"><br\/><\/a><\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p> <p>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1nlLiJNtsuc19PizRmx75CZc6PcJXyNwEcg7jQKum1fM\/edit\">About Code for JC Brigade Program<\/a>.<br\/>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1I3_f1_4sBgjGiwahmYo5I2OmqXi4jz7KJUsfw5gelk8\/edit#slide=id.g[masked]d9_1126\">About Code for America Brigade Network<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhen you attend our Meetup, you can sign in <a href=\"http:\/\/attendance.codeforjc.org\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>You can view our 2016 Strategic Plan <a href=\"http:\/\/www.docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1BtEto8XX3FaCqoSCESL5rkmkt2N6st6VdaEMDRW0UXA\/edit#heading=h.yqfbsdykacwf\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p>If you want to contact the leadership team, email us &lt;a&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Here is a list of our communication channels:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0GitHub \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.github.com\/CodeForJerseyCity\">www.github.com\/CodeForJerseyCity<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Slack \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slackinvite.me\/to\/codeforjc\">www.slackinvite.me\/to\/codeforjc<\/a> \u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Blog \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.medium.com\/@CodeForJC\">www.medium.com\/@CodeForJC<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Flicker <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/132970350@N05\/albums\">www.flickr.com\/photos\/[masked]@N05\/albums<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0FB Group\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/codeforjc\">www.facebook.com\/groups\/codeforjc<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.codeforjc.org","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Code-For-Jersey-City\/events\/229664662\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Civic Project Working Session with Special Guest, Nick Milak of Open Tree Map","id":"tvslqlyvgbzb","time":1461108600000,"updated":1461117611000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383926502000,"name":"Code for Jersey City","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":11021272,"urlname":"Code-For-Jersey-City","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"techies and community members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":4,"distance":21.5198497772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456756806000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/3\/e\/c\/event_14986060.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The Violet Flame is the most physical of all the spiritual flames.

In the\u00a0middle of that awesome visualization I felt a burst, a huge leap of energy expanding in my heart chakra (and since I am an energy healer it makes so much sense). Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears. I can feel at ease knowing I have this new tool in my hands, it's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and\u00a0I wanted to first thank you for hosting this. I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I love how you said to write down all your thoughts\/ lists about yourself, as well as goals, to see where the conflicts lie. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"I met Ayelet at a free Lust to Love Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>Ayelet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron\">www.Facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron<\/a>) is a relationship expert. I asked for her advice regarding my recent breakup with my boyfriend of six years, which is why I went to her event. Ayelet explained that we have a tendency to constantly chase guys who don't treat us right, and we have expectations of other people that in turn, create unhappiness in our lives. Working on the root chakra helps us let go of those expectations and find inner peace.<\/p> <p>The meditation event helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships. The free meditation she led was life changing for me.\"- Annie Yang, NYC<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Email AyeletCoach@gmail.com saying \"attending free webinar\" to receive access","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Life-Transformers\/events\/229904507\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":2700000,"name":"A Webinar on Manifesting Abundance","id":"lsxwqlyvgbrb","time":1461175200000,"updated":1461180177000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337054153000,"name":"Transform Your Life: ATTRACT Goals, Relationships, SUCCESS","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3867642,"urlname":"The-Life-Transformers","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"The Life Transformers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Online","name":"Online","lon":-74.005943,"id":24427048,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460666183000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":3.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Do you have your mobile marketing strategy well planned?<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"http:\/\/lp.vbout.com\/mobile-marketing\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lp.vbout.com\/mobile-marketing\/<\/a><\/p> <p>If you don't have a solid strategy, here are a few things to consider:<\/p> <p>\u2022 70% of mobile searches lead to online action within 1 hour.<br\/>\u2022 75% of Americans admit to bringing their phone to the bathroom.<br\/>\u2022 Mid-2015 Google announced half of searches came from mobile.<br\/>\u2022 People are 3x more likely to share content on a phone than desktop.<\/p> <p>A mobile strategy is essential and should be evaluated regularly against the latest developments and changes in this space.

How do we model and learn these networks? In contrast to conventional learning problems, where we have many independent samples, it is often the case for these networks that we can get only one independent sample. How do we use a single snapshot today to learn a model for the network, and therefore be able to predict a similar, but larger network in the future? In the case of relatively small or moderately sized networks, it's appropriate to model the network parametrically, and attempt to learn these parameters. For massive networks, a non-parametric representation is more appropriate. Here I show how to use the theory of graph limits, developed over the last decade, to give consistent estimators for machine learning of massive sparse networks, and moreover how to do this in a way that protects the privacy of individuals on the network.<\/p> <p><b>Biography:<\/b> Jennifer Tour Chayes is Distinguished Scientist and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she co-founded in 2008, and Microsoft Research New York City, which she co-founded in 2012. Chayes was Research Area Manager for Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Cryptography at Microsoft Research Redmond until 2008. Chayes joined Microsoft Research in 1997, when she co-founded the Theory Group. Her research areas include phase transitions in discrete mathematics and computer science, structural and dynamical properties of self-engineered networks, and algorithmic game theory. She is the co-author of about 125 scientific papers and the co-inventor of about 30 patents.<\/p> <p>Chayes has many ties to the academic community. She was for many years Professor of Mathematics at UCLA. She serves on numerous institute boards, advisory committees and editorial boards, including the Turing Award Selection Committee of the Association for Computing Machinery, the Board of Trustees of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, the Advisory Boards of the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farm Research Campus, and Women Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology. Chayes is a past Chair of the Mathematics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a past Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society.<\/p> <p>Chayes received her B.A. in biology and physics at Wesleyan University, where she graduated first in her class, and her Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Princeton. She did her postdoctoral work in the mathematics and physics departments at Harvard and Cornell. She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Sloan Fellowship, and the UCLA Distinguished Teaching Award. Chayes has recently been the recipient of many leadership awards including the Leadership Award of Women Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology, the Leading Women Award of the Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts, the Women to Watch Award of the Boston Business Journal, and the Women of Leadership Vision Award of the Anita Borg Institute. She has twice been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Chayes is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Fields Institute, the Association for Computing Machinery, the American Mathematical Society, a National Associate of the National Academies, and an Elected Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<\/p> <p>Chayes is well known for her work on phase transitions, in particular for laying the foundation for the study of phase transitions in problems in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science; this study is now giving rise to some of the fastest known algorithms for fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization. She is also one of the world's experts in the modeling and analysis of random, dynamically growing graphs, which are used to model the Internet, the World Wide Web and a host of other technological and social networks. Among Chayes' contributions to Microsoft technologies are the development of methods to analyze the structure and behavior of various networks, the design of auction algorithms, and the design and analysis of various business models for the online world.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Columbia-Data-Science-Institute\/events\/230487368\/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"duration":5400000,"name":"Colloquium Event | Jennifer Chayes | Once Upon a Graph","id":"230487368","time":1461186000000,"updated":1461193215000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1426608148000,"name":"Columbia Data Science Institute","group_lon":-74,"id":18508242,"urlname":"Columbia-Data-Science-Institute","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"DSI Followers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"41W 46th Street","name":"BarWorks.nyc","lon":-73.98056,"id":24443752,"state":"NY","lat":40.756927,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.689209699631,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461024899000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Three weeks ago BarWorks.nyc had their unofficial launch.<\/p> <p>Those who were there, know what a ton of fun it was.<\/p> <p><br\/>We are doing it one more time.

But the truth is that Spark Streaming lacks the robust data management capabilities that even moderately sophisticated applications require.<\/p> <p><br\/>But with SnappyData as part of your solution, now you get the benefit of powerful data management capabilities such as data consistency and transactions, complex querying, and high availability - all at in-memory processing speed.<\/p> <p><br\/>SnappyData is a new open source project that deeply integrates the Apache Geode in-memory data grid, an in-memory scale out SQL store, and Spark into a single unified cluster. This provides (i) low latency transactions, (ii) a new cluster manager capable of avoiding queuing and scheduling for low latency operations, (iii) and HA for all the components. This novel architecture transforms a spark cluster into a hybrid database with OLAP (compressed columnar tables) and OLTP tables with full HA and recovery.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>In this Meetup we'll discuss response time challenges with analytic queries on streams. We'll outline \"Synopsis\" synopses data structures available in SnappyData, such as stratified sampling, that reside along side \"exact\" data for fastest processing.\u00a0 We'll also present our design pattern for an Analytics SQL cache that combines Apache Spark and the Greenplum DB as the backend to speed up interactive query processing while accommodating continuous streaming writes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will demo\u00a0Snappy\u00a0working with Spark and Spark streaming, how to use them with the Spark programming model, and SQL\/Spark Dataframe extensions for supporting approximate query processing.\u00a0 We'll show how we achieve 10X performance gains of using SnappyData with Spark streaming compared to Cassandra and showcase similar gains when running OLAP queries on the ingested data compared to Spark SQL (using Stratified samples).\u00a0<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER:<\/p> <p>Jags\u00a0is a founder and the CTO of SnappyData.

A decade-long practitioner of OM, Rachel is a powerhouse of a woman. Electric, sharp, and clear-sighted, she takes a stand for wake-up in a world of asleep and never relents. A precision dismantler of her own mind, Rachel was once a Substance Abuse Counselor helping alcoholics and addicts find a higher power and get sober. She can be found behind the scenes always, tinkering with the subconscious and unraveling energetic knots in herself and her clients. Once she\u2019s taken you on, you\u2019re never really outside the reach of her heart again. She\u2019s fiercely loyal and uncompromisingly loving. She calls out every incongruent location she finds and her quality of attention often first confronts people, and then has them be able to trust her deeply, because she is quintessentially her true self in every location, every situation, in every group, with every friend.<\/p> <p>We play 3 communication game (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good.

Let\u2019s explore this important new text together and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers.

Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated <i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i>. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.<\/p> <p><i><b>A Course of Love<\/b><\/i> builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here.
