I have also had many gay male friends in relationships who have brought these issues up with me in private (and mostly tortured) conversation. Aside from expensive couples counseling, there doesn't seem to be a forum or group for gay male couples partners to share their experiences, seek feedback, ideas and support and offer some in return.

We share the company of our unabashedness and physical inspiration. The point is not to be performative or weird for weird's sake, but to let the music authentically spur movement. It is not social dancing, but more of an individual\/group workout. The group togetherness and common purpose allows people to let go of their self-consciousness and have an outrageously exhilarating time!

At least to start anyway. We never start out at a bar, but we often end up at one; however, drinking is not a requirement. As a matter of fact, many of our members do not drink at all, but some do. <\/p> \n<p>Date Walks consist of men and women in a certain age range. We walk and talk while exploring nice outdoor locations such as waterfronts, parks, food festivals, art fairs and the like. Sometimes we do day stuff and sometimes we do night stuff and usually on the weekends. Every 6 or so minutes I ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken with until everyone has spoken with everyone. I usually take the group to a bar\/restaurant for further bonding. Date Walking really is the easiest way to meet someone special.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Some of my more popular and repeating Date Walks are:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>\u25ba Big Group Brooklyn Bridge Sunset Singles Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Central Park Singles Stroll <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles 3-Bridge Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Roosevelt Island Walk <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Stroll around Astoria <br>\u25ba Big Group Singles Sunset Walk on the High Line <br>\u25ba Big Group Date Walk for Dog Lovers &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Thank you, <br> Beau, your Date Walking Organizer <br> &nbsp; <br> Call\/Text: 347-225-3516 <br> Email: datewalking@gmail.com<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/datewalking\">Date Walking<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/datewalking\">Facebook<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/datewalking\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>I've tried Plenty of Fish, OKcupid, Coffee meets Bagel, Craigslist, Tinder and so on and it's the same thing every time: a little bit of back-and-forth communication that eventually diminishes to nothing. Either that or you actually meet a person here and a person there and there's no chemistry so it's over. More wasted time. I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't.

It is a truly transformational modality that helps the breather recognize their union with their higher self and all of life with peace and absolute love.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13679717,"name":"Anna"},"members":98,"name":"Brooklyn Breathwork","id":18268827,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Breathwork","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Breathers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419295611000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"infj","name":"INFJ","id":3381},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"infp","name":"INFP","id":6398},{"urlkey":"mbti","name":"Myers-Briggs Type Indicator","id":9714},{"urlkey":"enfp","name":"ENFP","id":9823},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"intuition","name":"Intuition","id":18371},{"urlkey":"enfj","name":"ENFJ","id":27761},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"highly-sensitive-people","name":"Highly Sensitive People","id":37553},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Idealists-NF-INFP-INFJ-ENFP-ENFJ-meetup-Age-30\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Our Meetup Purpose:<\/b> This is a group for mature Myers-Briggs \"iNtuitive Feelers\" (NF) who want to meet other intuitive feelers for deeper and more intimate conversations and connections.&nbsp; Approximately one in ten people fit the NF personality profile.&nbsp; If you are not sure if you fit the profile, click \"Pages\" up above, and click on the free test link to take a personality test. &nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p>Our group of NFs will favor positive, uplifting, and inspiring conversations amongst those of us over 30 years old.&nbsp; It will be a supportive environment where we can learn and grow.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity.

Our mission is to create more fun, freedom and fulfillment in the lives of EVERYONE. Admit it, you are either in dire need of fun or you love to have fun. What better way to exercise that fun bone than traveling the world with friends and family, meeting some fun and amazing people, and participating in fun filled excursions. Best part about it is that you decide what fun is for you. What does freedom mean to you? Freedom from mediocrity. Maybe you are time broke, always working and never have time with family. Maybe you have too much time and no money to do the things you love to do. Everyone could use a little extra money or a lot of extra money. One thing is for sure, we would all love more quality time with family and friends. You decide what you would like to be free from or free to do. Here's my favorite part of what we are centered around; fulfillment. What would make you feel fulfilled in life? What are your dreams and aspirations in life? What if you surrounded yourself around goal-oriented, ambitious and hard-working individuals, is it safe to say your lifestyle will change for the better? Better yet, is it safe to say you become who you surround yourself around? If after answering these questions you have even an ounce of curiosity or interest than you are who we are looking for.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive).

In an attempt to pair off old tech with new tech and arts (and possible social contacts and jobs) we aim at types of hybridity with other scintillating minds.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183422897,"name":"PHILLIP BALDWIN"},"members":296,"name":"ART\/TECH SALON","id":18313553,"state":"NY","urlname":"ART-TECH-SALON","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.6399993896,"who":"COLLABORATORS IN ART\/TECH"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Glen Ridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1420737651000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"theology","name":"Theology","id":9854},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"interfaith","name":"Interfaith","id":10827},{"urlkey":"god","name":"God","id":20588},{"urlkey":"faith","name":"Faith","id":25051},{"urlkey":"christian-theology","name":"Christian Theology","id":33032},{"urlkey":"theology-on-tap","name":"Theology on Tap","id":42289},{"urlkey":"exploring-faith","name":"Exploring Faith","id":65416},{"urlkey":"interfaith-and-ecumenical-relations","name":"Interfaith and Ecumenical Relations","id":88737},{"urlkey":"theological-study-and-discussion","name":"Theological study and discussion","id":264721},{"urlkey":"theology-pub","name":"theology pub","id":647912},{"urlkey":"beer-theology","name":"Beer & Theology","id":856532}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Theology-on-Tap\/","rating":4,"description":"<p>About Theology on Tap: Have you ever noticed that sometimes your best and deepest theological reflections happen outside of your place of worship, when you are hanging out with friends?

In 1980, the 5-year relative survival rate for women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (cancer confined to the breast) was about 74 percent. Today, that number is 99 percent! Komen has played a critical role in every major advance in the fight against breast cancer - transforming how the world talks about and treats this disease and helping to turn millions of breast cancer patients into breast cancer survivors.

If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance.

I began marathon running in 2010 and consider running a bit of an obsession. After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs.

The constant headlines of change and disruption is enough to leave anyone with more questions than answers.<\/p>\n<p>While its natural to internalize and apply ones thinking to his\/her own interests, experts agree that it's also important to understand a view that is larger than that which transcends our own interests. The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.

Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

This setup is experimental of course, and we expect active participation from the attendees.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":67062442,"name":"Anna Royzman"},"members":38,"name":"All Hands On Deck Workshops","id":18401108,"state":"NY","urlname":"All-Hands-On-Deck-Workshops","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422760661000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"fundraising","name":"Fundraising","id":20761},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-marketing","name":"Nonprofit Marketing","id":34085},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-communications","name":"Nonprofit Communications","id":34088},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-management","name":"Nonprofit management","id":46558},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"nonprofits-needing-help","name":"Nonprofits Needing Help","id":59634},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-technology","name":"Nonprofit Technology","id":59903},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-solutions","name":"Nonprofit Solutions","id":95206},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-networking","name":"Nonprofit Networking","id":115818},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-professional-development","name":"Nonprofit Professional Development","id":115819},{"urlkey":"networking-for-nonprofits","name":"Networking for Nonprofits","id":159120},{"urlkey":"nonprofit-501-c-3-tax-exemption","name":"Nonprofit 501 (c) (3) tax exemption","id":782862}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Nonprofit-Executive-Directors-NED-Meetup\/","rating":4.64,"description":"<p>This Meetup is for current, former, and aspiring Non-Profit Executive Directors GLOBALLY to help grow our respective organizations.

Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash"},"members":174,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423511901000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"playwrights","name":"Playwrights","id":15224},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"playwriting-workshop","name":"Playwriting Workshop","id":55629}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-One-Acts-and-Snacks-Staged-Readings-and-Discussion\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>One Acts and Snacks is a monthly gathering that celebrates new works written by up-and-coming playwrights.

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille"},"members":129,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp; Like Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, and Richard Branson we know how important public speaking can be to our professional and personal success.&nbsp; But similar to sleeping and eating, our busy schedules don't always allow us to devote enough time to it.&nbsp; The goal of Speech Partiers is to make public speaking fun and to hack the learning process.&nbsp; We do activities inspired by both the power of neuroscience and the power of crowdsourcing to speed up our progress.&nbsp; Welcome to the party!&nbsp; <\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/highres_434226136.jpeg","photo_id":434226136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/600_434226136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/thumb_434226136.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":114208432,"name":"Shannon"},"members":220,"name":"Speech Party: Busy People Speed-Learn Public Speaking","id":18427559,"state":"NY","urlname":"Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Speech Partiers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423681987000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"science","name":"Science","id":85},{"urlkey":"environment","name":"Environment","id":89},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","id":15998},{"urlkey":"social-justice","name":"Social Justice","id":17986},{"urlkey":"unemployment-support","name":"Unemployment Support","id":19080},{"urlkey":"courses-and-workshops","name":"Courses and Workshops","id":20629},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"job-search","name":"Job Search","id":21900},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Premiere-Sustainability-Networking-and-Workshop-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Hungry for sustainability!

This award is given by Toastmasters International to the clubs that accomplished at least 5 of its specified goals. Not only is our club effective, but it is so much fun that it\u2019s addictive! Our membership is open to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills in a culturally diverse environment. We meet in mid-town Manhattan twice a month, and in each meeting, we run two sessions; first in English and then in Japanese. However, you do not need to speak Japanese and you are very welcome to participate in the English session only. Our club provides a friendly and supportive environment where you can build up confidence with each speaking assignment. By regularly presenting a speech in front of like-minded professionals, you will soon find yourself speaking in a more relaxed and confident manner to the board of directors, to your customers or even in job interviews! Feel free to join us as a guest and see for yourself how it works.

Then for the next 20-30 minutes, the rest of us will brainstorm, share ideas, solutions, and constructive feedback towards a solution for her.

SONW is beneficial for those who both in ill and good health.<\/p>\n<p><span><b>We do not walk properly<\/b><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>All of the known benefits from these various researches are only a minor part of the true benefits we can achieve from walking. The true benefits have not yet been achieved because most people still do not walk properly. <br> <br>What\u2019s the proof? Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.

I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":131857822,"name":"Marthe"},"members":109,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

Pepperdata delivers predictability, increasing performance, and visibility for business-critical Hadoop jobs on existing clusters running multiple applications. Pepperdata's software makes every Hadoop node more efficient, allowing companies to run more jobs on the existing infrastructure.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine"},"members":522,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.
