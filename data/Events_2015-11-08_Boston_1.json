Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November).

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating. And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don\u2019t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents\u2019 attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with \u2013 a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.\u00a0But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human\u2014and humanizing\u2014thing that we do.\u00a0\u00a0The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other.\u00a0<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

Mitchell's music blends the organic and synthetic for a balanced fusion inspired by sample based Hip\u00adHop, Downtempo, House, Funk and R&amp;B.

The first was on Summer Street in South Boston and was the third concept developed by the group. Serving the finest food, with the freshest ingredients, hand muddling Margaritas and making fresh to order Hand Hacked Guacamole were some of our early ideas. Today Somerville will be our fourth location joining the Summer St, City Square Charlestown, and Downtown Crossing location.<\/p> <p>\n\nNow serving over 180 tequilas Papagayo is the best Mexican Food \u2013 Tequila bar around. Inside you will find juxtaposition of old and new with old world wood and brick combined with bright colors, Mexican Art and colorful paintings. We believe we were the first to introduce the Coronita, a large freshly made Margarita with a 7 ounce Coronita turned upside down in the Margarita. Ole!!<\/p> <p>\n\nMaking our Margaritas from scratch with fresh fruit, agave nectar, 100% blue agave tequila, and orange liquor you will find them to be the best around. Our food is prepared with the finest local vegetables, fresh made tortillas and the freshest proteins found. Between the blend of mouth watering Margaritas and the freshest food Papagayo has become a regular stop in the Boston area.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/food-menu-somerville\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/food-menu-somerville\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/food-menu-somerville\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/drink-menu-somerville\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/drink-menu-somerville\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/drink-menu-somerville\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/parking-directions-somerville\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/parking-directions-somerville\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/papagayorestaurants.com\/parking-directions-somerville\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Table for Sarah","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Womens-Group\/events\/225869769\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"After Fashion Show Dinner at Papagayo :   Assembly Row in Somerville","id":"225869769","time":1445038200000,"updated":1445050810000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1275931722000,"name":"North Shore Women's Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1657438,"urlname":"North-Shore-Womens-Group","group_lat":42.5,"who":"girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Somerville","address_1":"62 Bow St","name":"The Green Room","lon":-71.099228,"id":23542643,"lat":42.381496,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":19,"distance":2.10962414742,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1419978521000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Three hours of piano karaoke at The Green Room --- a wonderfully intimate venue in the heart of Union Square, Somerville.<\/p> <p>Much more info here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianokaraoke.net\/#!faq\/cv94\">FAQ page<\/a><\/p> <p><b>COST:<\/b> $5+ requested donation at the door (to defray venue rental, piano tuning fees, Meetup organizer fees, etc.)<\/p> <p><b>NOTE:<\/b> The exterior door of The Green Room is a little tricky --- lift the handle UP instead of pulling it down!<\/p> <p><b>PARKING:<\/b> metered parking is available in the neighborhood.

Not only do they have the best boats that are most suitable for Saba\u2019s diving, they also have an office\/retail shop on the main corner of the main village. This means they are accessible to you for any helpful information from making a dinner reservation to organizing a hike or just to come in and chat or check out a fish or creature in our identification books. Another considerable Sea Saba Difference is the quality and enthusiasm of the guides. Although each of the staff members is an experienced instructor with multiple professional ratings, they still like to use the word guide as this is the primary function when on the dive boats. With a number of internal programs to keep the dive crew inspired, enthusiastic and continuing to learn more about the reefs and their inhabitants in order to be the best guides possible and to share that information with diving guests. At minimum, each of the instructors is a Level 3 REEF surveyor. At Sea Saba, they recognize divers work hard all year to have a dive vacation. They want to be able to offer you as much diving as you desire. Therefore, they have dive crew on stand-by for night dives on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays\u2013They just need 4 divers to plan a night dive. Extra afternoon dives can be pre-booked or added once on Island.<\/p> <p>Diving is Sunday-Thursday, 2 dives per day. Afternoon activities can be taxi tour ($15-20 additional cost), visit to Jo Bean\u2019s glass jewelry (free demos, glass blowing lessons additional), nature hikes guided by Kat, may require taxi txfer to\/from trailhead $5-10, Yoga class that is designed by Kat to be a standing-only class. We will also be on the island during Sea and learn month (www.seaandlearn.org) so afternoons could involve field projects with science experts, lectures, hikes, etc. All free unless involving transportation or boat time.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869016\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbwb","time":1445072400000,"updated":1445085321000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Burlington","address_1":"123 Cambridge St.","name":"Burlington High School","lon":-71.194824,"id":23559168,"state":"MA","lat":42.50095,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":11.6585683823,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444686640000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Cleats And Shin Guards.

As a result I was able to balance my life more effectively, including making a firm commitment to self-care and to my relationship as well as making necessary changes to my consulting business. I am an Executive Coach and Organization Development Consultant, so I have had a lot of experience with people in the field. Maria is one of the best out there.

This is one of our favorite beginner-friendly hiking locations. This hike is so easy we sometimes call it a walk. We will be meeting near the map as you approach the golf course and will start and end our hike along the golf course. The sections along the golf course are mostly paved. The balance of the hike is groomed trails with mostly gentle hills with a couple of challenges. This is a Green-Dot Trail within the Blue Hills Reservation. Most Green Dot Trails have very few steep inclines, some rugged terrain with a mix of flat and sometimes paved terrain, and no climbing.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis Hike is approximately 4.5 miles (give or take 1\/5 mi) and takes approximately 1 &amp; 1\/4 - 1 &amp; 1\/2 hours to complete (give or take 5-10 minutes depending on the speed of the group). While the first and last 1\/2 mile is along the golf course on a paved path the majority of the Hike is in the woods is along a path on uneven ground, yet very beginner-friendly. This Hike is in the woods and near water so it is recommended that you wear bug spray. You may also want a hat, sunglasses and water. We use the paved path along the golf course for our warm-up and cool-down and get to watch some golf along the way.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis will be a great way to take in the fall foliage, enjoy a heart-healthy walk\/hike and socialize with fellow South Shore Walkabouts and friends over a picnic lunch. There is a concession stand inside with some food, including hot dogs, sandwiches, chips and beverages.

This should be a relatively easy hike, but of course it's still a hike. Here are some excerpts from the Hiker's Guide to the Mounts of NH: This is a popular, exciting hike to an open summit with sweeping views of Lake Winnipesaukee, central New Hampshire and into Maine. Although it is a short hike and popular with families, the mountain is quite steep with a couple of spots some hikers may find a little difficult. At the outset the trail coincides with a jeep road, branches off it and returns to it. After a brief level section, the trail departs left from the jeep road and climbs steadily to the summit. Rock slabs are ascended and views of the lake begin to open up. The wide open summit area is spectacular and the old stone enclosure will provide relief from the cooling breeze. Take the same route back down.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b>: From Boston, drive North on 93 until you get to NH\u00a0<br\/>Take Exit 20 (Tilton) in NH on Rte 93\u00a0<br\/>Follow NH-11 E\/US-3 N 6.5 mi\u00a0<br\/>Turn right at NH-11 E\/US-3 N\/Laconia-Gilford Bypass (just beyond the Belknap Mall) 5.6 mi\u00a0<br\/>Take the NH-11 E exit 0.4 mi\u00a0<br\/>Keep left at the fork, follow signs for New Hampshire 11 E 233 ft\u00a0<br\/>Turn left at NH-11 E\/Lake Shore Rd\u00a0<br\/>Continue to follow NH-11 E 10.7 mi.\u00a0<br\/>The Mt.\u00a0Major\u00a0Parking Lot will be on the right\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Transportation is the responsibility of the individual, however we will do our best to accommodate you.

The Concord River is ideal for small boats, and the Bedford boat launch at the Carlisle Road bridge is a popular launching spot for canoes, rowboats &amp; kayaks. The Concord River is a placid river with a light breeze; it swings around corners spreading out to submerge the bottoms of trees. On the sides, there are trees and bushes growing up out of the water, and if you are watching, you'll see turtles, beavers, and many different kinds of birds. There is a wildlife refuge on both sides with posted signs... great for nature watching. Paddling up river, we will eventually reach the <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/mima\/index.htm\">Minute Man National Park<\/a><\/b>. We can beach the boats at the North Bridge where the spark of the American Revolution ignited a war, walk around or sit on a bench and have lunch. There are Historians around the park that will tell you all about it, as well as the start of literary revolution with a new Western philosophy called Transcendentalism. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and a few others lived in Concord.<\/p> <p>This paddle will last approx. 5 hrs with a round trip distance of 9 miles.<\/p> <p><b>Life Jackets (PFD's) are always required to be worn when paddling with this group.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Note: I picked this date based on a Fall Foliage Tracker...

The stones can also serve as a protective layer to help retain moisture in the soil during the dry summer months.<\/p> <p>Please join us to taste this wine with its wide array of aromas and flavors reminiscent of a Proven\u00e7al marketplace while its texture\u2014rich and round, sumptuous and opulent\u2014is virtually unmatched by most of the wines of the world.<\/p> <p>Bring a bottle of <b>Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape at about the $50-80 price range<\/b>\u00a0(in a paper bag), 4 glasses and a food item to share.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Blind-Tastings\/events\/223913731\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape","id":"223913731","time":1445122800000,"updated":1445291453000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348239833000,"name":"Boston Blind Wine Tastings","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":5036692,"urlname":"Boston-Blind-Tastings","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Tasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":18.2965488434,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444765468000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Arrive at 7:00, we'll start playing at 7:30<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Womens-Poker-Group\/events\/226036583\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Texas Holdem in North Reading","id":"226036583","time":1445122800000,"updated":1445192973000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1409747264000,"name":"Women's Poker Group","group_lon":-71.2200012207,"id":16768042,"urlname":"Womens-Poker-Group","group_lat":42.5999984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":24.5682811737,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443615219000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are on the second floor of the office\/clubhouse building.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869019\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbxb","time":1445158800000,"updated":1445170857000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","city":"Lowell ","address_1":"300 Martin Luther King Jr. Way","name":" Tsongas Center ","lon":-71.313225,"id":7443892,"state":"MA","lat":42.649769,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5923786163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426473182000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For Baystate full\/half marathon runners and cheering squad. \u00a0All runners, volunteers, friends and family are welcome.<\/p> <p>Runners, try to arrive by 7:00AM or earlier to avoid delays.

Special note for people new to the outdoors: Personally I'll be looking to climb harder stuff this time, (i.e. in the main quarry), which means less time given to showing people how to set up anchors, etc. If you don't know how, do come down - it's a great place to learn this stuff and I or someone else will show you the basics. But just be aware I won't be doing it all day and as always you're responsible for your own safety.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nQuincy Quarry is, as the name suggests, a quarry just outside Quincy. It has a shedload of top-roping routes ranging from a set of friendly-looking 5.6s in little railroad, to some pretty burly looking routes in the 5.11 range on the overhanging Q-wall. There is even a single, solitary, route than can be led.<br\/>Other popular activities in the quarry include graffiti, drinking, smoking weed, and disposing of bodies.<\/p> <p>You can very conceivably get there by public transport from Boston: take the red line to Quincy center and then the 215 bus. If anyone has a car, however, the journey will be much simpler. Car pooling would be much appreciated, I'm sure.<\/p> <p>I'd suggest we meet under Q-wall in the main quarry at about 11:30am - if you're coming from the car park it's the first one you come to, on the right as you enter.<\/p> <p>Good topos are available on mountain project along with an aerial map of the quarry so you can orient yourselves:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountainproject.com\/v\/quincy-quarries\/105908121\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mountainproject.com\/v\/quincy-quarries\/105908121<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>==Gear: [ please read carefully ]==<\/p> <p>Most routes have expansion bolts above them for setting up a top-rope. A decent rack for Quincy will involve about 8-10m of rigging rope or thick tape, a handful of locking carabiners (min 4 per anchor), and a 50m rope or longer. The rock is pretty stable, but a helmet would be a smart move.<br\/>Obviously the number of people who can go at any time is limited by the number of ropes etc, so please make it known in the comments if you have a rope to offer, or rigging gear, or will be relying on other people.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian residents want local alternatives to Israeli goods, including milk, which they have been buying from an Israeli company. Activists in filmmaker Amer Shomali\u2019s village of Beit Sahour, a suburb of Bethlehem, decide to buy 18 cows from an Israeli kibbutz, transport them to the West Bank, and produce their own milk as a cooperative. The cows become legendary, and the \u201cintifada milk\u201d (sometimes distributed under cover of darkness) becomes a part of daily life. But this act of defiance does not go unnoticed. The Israeli Army raids the\u00a0dairy,\u00a0photographs the cows, and declares the farm a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. Employing an impressive mixture of media\u2014claymation, comic strips, reenactment, archived video footage, sketches, photographs, interviews and voiceover narration\u2014this ingenious documentary captures the spirit of the first Palestinian uprising through the personal experiences of those who lived it-and provides an enchanting, inspirational tribute to the ingenuity and power of grassroots activism.\u00a0In English, Arabic, and Hebrew with English\u00a0subtitles.\u00a0<\/p> <p>To view trailer,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ekhTuZpMw54\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ekhTuZpMw54\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ekhTuZpMw54<\/a>\u00a0<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonpalestinefilmfest.org\/about\/&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bostonpalestinefilmfest.org\/about\/&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>;<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mfa.org\/programs\/film\/the-wanted-18&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mfa.org\/programs\/film\/the-wanted-18&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>;<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/harvard-events\/events-calendar\/#\/?i=5&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/harvard-events\/events-calendar\/#\/?i=5&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>;<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"at the entrance to the auditorium, directly across from the cafe","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Culture-Club\/events\/225370474\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Wanted 18 - MFA Palestine Film Festival","id":"225370474","time":1445191200000,"updated":1445220070000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302069101000,"name":"Boston Culture Club","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":1810629,"urlname":"Boston-Culture-Club","group_lat":42.4599990845,"who":"Culture Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":1.68380987644,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1444576676000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Intermediate level : Players with a good understanding of volleyball strategy and a good grasp of volleyball skills.

And I don't feel particularly enlightened when I look up the answer, which turns out to be n(n+1)(2n + 1)\/6.<\/p> <p>There is a better way! Discrete calculus is calculus on integers instead of the reals. It's an alternate universe where we start by defining differentiation:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/mathurl.com\/nblkt3u.png\" \/><\/p> <p>and go from there. (That's an operator, which takes in functions and spits out functions. Don't worry if it doesn't make perfect sense right now, this is just the teaser!) The counterpart of integration in discrete calculus is summation.<\/p> <p>This gives us a systematic way to solve sums like the above. But also: Funky! Wacky! Every concept from calculus has one or several cousins in discrete calculus. For example, there's a discrete version of e and two discrete versions of log. There's a discrete power rule and a discrete product rule (and you can discretely integrate by parts). Discrete differential equations are recurrence relations (for example, the Fibonacci recurrence relation f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)).<\/p> <p>This will be my first talk, and I'm hoping to make it as interactive as possible. If you have questions <b>please ask them<\/b>! There is always a minimum of two other people that your question will help out as well, three if you count me.<\/p> <p>You can make some pretty far-reaching analogies with this stuff, and also some pretty concrete ones, so it should be accessible to people coming from a variety of backgrounds. If you ever listed out the squares:<\/p> <p>1 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 9 \u00a0 16 \u00a0 25 \u00a0 36 \u00a0 49 \u00a0 64<\/p> <p>and then noticed that if you subtracted each number from the one following it, you got the odd numbers...<\/p> <p>1 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 9 \u00a0 16 \u00a0 25 \u00a0 36 \u00a0 49 \u00a0 64<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a05 \u00a0 7 \u00a0 \u00a09 \u00a0 \u00a011 \u00a0 \u00a0 13 \u00a0 \u00a015<\/p> <p>then you were doing discrete calculus!

But, they can take quite a while to play. We play with poker chips and emphasize a \"ready to play\" culture (we usually track operating order, so you know when your companies will act). Games have generally taken from 2 hours (via bankruptcy) to 6 hours (to the end) with the average around five hours, even with new players. The more you plan in advance, the faster the game (of course, many times the other robber barons thwart your plans!)<\/p> <p><b>You will need to be ready to start right at the starting time, or very close to it,<\/b> because the game is so long. We also are splitting into two games quite frequently now so being early is better so we can decide which 18xx games to play and then have to set them up, unless we ALL can come to a pre-arrangement in the comments.<\/p> <p><br\/>New players are welcome although we strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the basic rules and concepts first. A brand new player will need 20 to 40 minutes of rules explanation before they play, so if you're new and Tamm says the room is available a little earlier than our 2pm start time (it isn't always), we recommend setting up an early teaching session with an experienced player. The game really isn't overly complex, rules-wise, it's just long with lots of decisions. It is a little fiddly sometimes, though.<\/p> <p><br\/>Due to some late arrivals in September we will emphasize: If you're over 15 minutes late and have not made arrangements with one of the tables, you are probably only going to be a mere spectator, unless there is a game doing a rules explanation, you know that 18xx variant well, and can make it before it starts. If you're much later you probably won't be able to join a game at all. It usually takes us all afternoon and well into the evening to play one game of 18xx. Even our more \"experienced\" tables usually drop four or five hours into a single game (or more; 18EU ran about six to seven hours last time). It is rare that there is a second game.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What you need to know about 334 Mass Ave:<\/b><\/p> <p>-Press 999 on the intercom and security will let you into the building<br\/>-You must sign in at the security desk with a picture ID<br\/>-Take the elevator down to level \"A.\" Exit the elevator to your left and the community room will be ahead on your right, next to the laundry room.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel\/events\/225676919\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":30600000,"name":"October 18xx Trainapalooza","id":"225676919","time":1445191200000,"updated":1445223550000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1381362719000,"name":"Greater Boston Cube Cartel","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":10626002,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Cube-Cartel","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cube Pushers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02446","country":"us","city":"Brookline","address_1":"384 Harvard St. ","name":"Kehillath Israel Park ","lon":-71.125847,"id":13462392,"state":"MA","lat":42.344669,"repinned":false},"headcount":6,"distance":3.04835033417,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442698779000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-427\/events\/225474338\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami","id":"cswxglytnbxb","time":1445194800000,"updated":1445227142000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1135197087000,"name":"Reading books by international writers","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":216983,"urlname":"bookclub-427","group_lat":42.3300018311,"who":"International Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02130","country":"us","city":"Jamaica Plain","phone":"617-524-1718","address_1":"125 Arborway","name":"Arnold Arboretum","lon":-71.119942,"id":595034,"state":"MA","lat":42.30838,"repinned":false},"headcount":13,"distance":4.39380931854,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443881989000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Arboretum\u2019s maple collection is a hotspot for beautiful autumn color.<\/p> <p>Let's\u00a0get out to enjoy\u00a0the most colorful time\u00a0of the year in Boston by joining\u00a0Nancy Rose\u00a0the <a href=\"http:\/\/arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\/\">Arnoldia<\/a> editor on a stroll through the maples.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869024\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbzb","time":1445245200000,"updated":1445257831000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"1 Meetup ","name":"The Meetup Web Site -time to pay the Meetup fee ","lon":-71.059776,"id":12127532,"state":"MA","lat":42.358429,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":0.533942341805,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":2,"created":1426512172000,"fee":{"amount":11,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a friendly monthly reminder to contribute $11 yearly to help us pay off the yearly Meetup Group fee and additional cost to run the group and keep the group going.

Also, note that\u00a0 Biagio is NOT getting rich from the group fees.\u00a0 This is a YEARLY fee and NOT a monthly fee.<\/p> <p>I wanted to address any crazy rumors and incorrect assumptions that I am getting rich from Meetup. These assumptions are based on having ALL 9,000 members paying the $10 a member fee which would equal $90,000, but that is 100% incorrect. I am not making $90,000 a year for this group!<\/p> <p>So please let me clarify less than 1% of the group\u2019 members actually pay the $11 yearly Voluntarily Donation. Out of that $11 PayPal take their cut so I only get \u00a0$10 per member. I barley take in $200 a year and that is NOT enough cover the yearly Meetup fees and the other Meetup expense like printing out Meetup materials, supplies for the group, batteries, games, Meetup business cards, etc. Over the past 6 years I've acquired over $2000 of debt to run this group and cover Meetup expenses. So it is time to understand the truth and stop making assumption.<\/p> <p>Biagio is pretty Poor and Not rich. Luckily, there hasn\u2019t yet been a need for me to start to begging for money on the side of the street\u2026\u2026\u2026.. yet!<\/p> <p>I am now paying Meetup a $200\u00a0\u00a0fee\u00a0\u00a0every year to run the group.\u00a0In 2015\u00a0we have only collected $150 from members for the Meetup Group Fee so far, and we have not paid off the 2014 debt which is over $500 now. If we cannot get members to pay off the 2014 and 2015 debt\u00a0 then I\u2019m just going to let the group shut down due to lack of \u00a0funding when the 2016 payment is due.<\/p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, \u00a0I pay for batteries, supplies, \u00a0printouts, \u00a0signs, games, stands \u00a0etc. etc. to run this group its over $700 a year, \u00a0which includes the $200 a year Meetup fee!<\/p> <p>So please be informed and\u00a0realize what it takes to run a group this large. Oh and add to that I spend 30+ hours every week of my own time running the group which I get paid $0 for.<\/p> <p>Please help keep the group going. Don\u2019t let not giving $11 a year, every year stop all the fun.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users\u2019 personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company\u2019s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can\u2019t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman\u2019s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lowell-Book-Club-Meetup\/events\/221983669\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"Book Club","id":"dfszqkytnbzb","time":1445292000000,"updated":1445383284000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1410018048000,"name":"Lowell Book Club Meetup","group_lon":-71.3399963379,"id":16831542,"urlname":"Lowell-Book-Club-Meetup","group_lat":42.6500015259,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02110","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"72 Broad Street","name":"Vintage Lounge","lon":-71.053314,"id":7678412,"state":"MA","lat":42.357685,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.868241071701,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438357116000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out for our fun monthly night of social and professional networking!

For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869027\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbbc","time":1445331600000,"updated":1445343949000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02472","country":"us","city":"Watertown","address_1":"76 Bigelow Avenue","address_2":"next door to Shiraz Cusine restaurant","name":"76 Bigelow Avenue","lon":-71.157166,"id":11082702,"state":"MA","lat":42.368317,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.49609136581,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1366809209000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Watertown-Belmont-Newton-Business-Referral-Networking\/events\/219482590\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Weekly Tuesday Morning Network Meetings","id":"dznnvfytnbbc","time":1445338800000,"updated":1445350431000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357829543000,"name":"Watertown\/Belmont\/Newton Business Referral Networking","group_lon":-71.1800003052,"id":6589142,"urlname":"Watertown-Belmont-Newton-Business-Referral-Networking","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Business Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pembroke","address_1":"300 Oak Street Suite 170","name":"Corporate Park","lon":-70.766121,"id":23948316,"state":"MA","lat":42.105453,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5210285187,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436281320000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are a new BNI start-up chapter currently looking for new members.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are in the first building in corporate park across the street from Tomassi's next to ideal weight loss.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-River-Business-Alliance-start-up-BNI-Meetup\/events\/226053441\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":610200000,"name":"North River business alliance","id":"mbvcjlytnbbc","time":1445340600000,"updated":1445951502000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434624490000,"name":"North River Business Alliance (start-up)  (BNI) Meetup","group_lon":-70.8099975586,"id":18681735,"urlname":"North-River-Business-Alliance-start-up-BNI-Meetup","group_lat":42.0600013733,"who":"Networking professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Wakefield","address_1":"1321 Main St., 2nd Floor","name":"Zoom Zone","lon":-71.061348,"id":23820544,"state":"MA","lat":42.473297,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":7.85639572144,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444173304000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/9\/c\/600_442776764.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Would you like to feel safely embraced and be carried away into the peaceful Qi waves?<\/i><\/p> <p>This form is a flowing like a river QiGong form.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28.

Skip it if you would rather just wing it and meet us at the track. We'll fill you in there.<\/p> <p>If you have never run on a track before, don't worry if none of this makes sense right now. As much as I will try to prep you, it usually just takes a few laps around the track for all of this to sink in.<\/p> <p><b>The Workout<\/b><\/p> <p>The workouts vary on a weekly basis and are usually interval based. We sometimes do workouts that are fun and different. Come see what this weeks workout is!<\/p> <p><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>1. The distances (200, 400, 800, etc.) are the distances we run on the track. Each lap around the track is 400 meters.<\/p> <p>2. Each lap is supposed to be run at a certain speed, based on your 5k pace. Don't know what your 5k pace is? Read my instructions below to calculate your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>*3. The recovery interval (RI), which is indicated in parentheses, may be a specified timed interval or a distance that you walk\/jog.<\/p> <p><b>Things to remember<\/b><\/p> <p>Track workouts are supposed to be FUN! Don't be intimidated or dread a track workout. This is supposed to be a fun supplement to your other \"normal\" runs. With all of us out there encouraging each other it should be a blast.<\/p> <p>Bring a running stopwatch\/wristwatch if you have one! Using the start\/lap\/stop function will help you pace yourself on each lap.<\/p> <p>Don't push it! If something hurts or starts to feel tight, don't risk an injury because you ran too hard on your first track workout of the summer. We have plenty of time to ease in...<\/p> <p>Bring water for the end!!!<\/p> <p><b>5k pace instructions<\/b><\/p> <p>Decide how fast you would like to run a 5k. Choose a time that is reasonable yet challenging. Convert that time to seconds, and divide the seconds by 12.5 (the number of 400 meter laps it takes to run 5k). That is your 5k pace.<\/p> <p>As an example, I might decide a reasonable yet challenging goal time for a 5k is 24 minutes.<\/p> <p>24 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 1440 seconds<\/p> <p>1440 seconds divided by 12.5 laps in a 5k ~= 115 seconds \/ lap<\/p> <p>This means that I will run the workout according to a pace of 115 seconds \/ lap.<\/p> <p>I will also have pacing charts available at the track, so don't fret.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.informalrunning.com\/category\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonruns\/events\/225862703\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Track Tuesday","id":"qntkthytnbbc","time":1445380200000,"updated":1445392680000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179282543000,"name":"Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":502534,"urlname":"bostonruns","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Llama's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Somerville","address_1":"438 Somerville Avenue","name":"Cambridge Hackspace @ P.irateship","lon":-71.10244,"id":24079947,"state":"MA","lat":42.381321,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.22099041939,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440949966000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Spend some time on your project by bringing it along to our weekly project night, an evening designed around you and what you're working on.<\/p> <p>This weekly event is about finding time to tinker, being creative, and meeting other members of the community. \u00a0You'll get the chance to see what others are working on, share your projects, and to get inspiration and feedback from fellow tinkerers.<\/p> <p>On any given Tuesday night you have people working on\u00a0electronics, knitting, writing code, wood-working, or just their plans for world domination.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Baby Pool is located within the Charlestown Navy Yard, and within a brick facade wall.

All teams are given the survey questions that people were asked, and then you have to guess the answers given.

Tart aromas of stone fruit and fruity hops (El Dorado, Columbus, Cascade). Intense apricot on the palate with soft, inviting acidity. Full, creamy mouthfeel with pleasantly spicy tannins from both fruit skins and new oak. Crush, crush, crush.<\/p> <p>Knee Deep Lupulin River<br\/>Imperial IPA - 8%<br\/>This Double IPA includes Mosaic and Simcoe hops, South American specialty malt, and tons of tastiness. Looks like liquid gold, smells like a bright tropical fruit pine forest, and tastes like all that and more.<\/p> <p>Founder's ReDANKulous<br\/>Imperial IPA - 9.5% - 90 IBU<br\/>reDANKulous Imperial Red IPA is a no frills, bold 9.5% ABV India Pale Ale. It pours a pleasing burnt amber with some sweetness due to the Caramalt and roasted barley used in the malt bill. But hops are the true headliner in this elaborate sensory experience. The spicy, piney, tropical complexities of Chinook, Mosaic and Simcoe hops hit you right away with their dank aroma\u2014and they stick around. Take a sip to have your palate simultaneously walloped and caressed in all the right places. Combined, the hops take the beer to 90 IBUs. It\u2019s not just ridiculous. It\u2019s reDANKulous.<\/p> <p>Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin<br\/>India Pale Ale (IPA) - 7% 70 IBUs<br\/>Our Grapefruit Sculpin is the latest take on our signature IPA. Some may say there are few ways to improve Sculpin\u2019s unique flavor, but the tart freshness of grapefruit perfectly complements our IPA\u2019s citrusy hop character. Grapefruit\u2019s a winter fruit, but this easy-drinking ale tastes like summer.<\/p> <p>Allagash Hugh Malone<br\/>Belgian Strong Ale - 8.5%<br\/>Hugh Malone begins with a grain bill featuring a blend of Maine grown barley, imported Pilsner, and raw wheat malt. At the beginning of run off, we add a portion of hops to the sweet wort in the kettle; a technique known as \"first wort hopping\". As the boil begins, a generous amount of Chinook hops are added for bittering. Later, in the whirlpool, the beer is hopped with a blend of Centennial and Amarillo, for aroma. This same blend is used, post fermentation, to lend additional hop character to the finished beer. The result is a complex brew with a malty palate, intense hop aromas, pronounced bitterness and a pleasantly dry finish.<\/p> <p>Boulder Beer Shake Chocolate Beer<br\/>Porter - 5.9%<br\/>Our twist on the traditional american porter, Shake chocolate porter is black in color with rich, dark chocolate aromatics and flavors and subtle coffee-like notes. This unique brew blends five different grains, including Chocolate Wheat, that along with cacao nibs create a devilishly delicious chocolate finish with a velvety mouth feel.<\/p> <p>Goose Island Sofie<br\/>Belgian Style Farmhouse - 6.5% - 20 IBU<br\/>Our sparkling Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale is wine barrel-aged with an abundance of hand-zested orange peel. Spicy white pepper notes contrast the citrus tartness. The light, refreshing, creamy vanilla finish will excite those fond of Champagne.<\/p> <p>Originally brewed by Belgian farmers to attract the best farm hands, we were inspired to brew an exceptional ale as inviting as the original Belgian Farmhouse ales. Light and effervescent, we named it for our founder\u2019s granddaughter Sofie.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CraftBeerCrew\/events\/226103737\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Rare Beer Night! - Lulu's Highlights 2xIPAs, Apricot Sour, and Chocolate Porter!","id":"226103737","time":1445382000000,"updated":1445394353000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1244479423000,"name":"The Craft Beer Crew","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":1469154,"urlname":"CraftBeerCrew","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"beer buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Natick","address_1":"17 Fox Hill Drive","name":"Dave's House","lon":-71.327644,"id":23789887,"state":"MA","lat":42.314144,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5626401901,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429926622000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We meet most Tuesdays to play Go in Natick.

We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies.

These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition.

The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869028\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbcc","time":1445418000000,"updated":1445430507000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","city":"Lowell","address_1":"300 Martin Luther King Jr Way","name":"Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell","lon":-71.313225,"id":13331082,"state":"MA","lat":42.649769,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5923786163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1392657020000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Proceed to the second level of the Tsongas Arena and head left across the concourse toward the Talon Club.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Baby Pool is located within the Charlestown Navy Yard, and within a brick facade wall.

Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.<\/p> <p><br\/>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent\/collaborative work time.<\/p> <p><br\/>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles.

Yet, designers and landscapers sometimes worry that these species might not survive the tough growing conditions associated with commercial and institutional landscapes, foundation plantings, or other challenging sites. However, many native species will perform well\u2014 especially if you understand which plants to use where, and how to get them established. They also make excellent ecologically friendly replacements for the ubiquitous, but now banned, invasive shrubs like winged euonymus and barberry. This workshop will teach us about native shrubs that are adaptable to tough conditions\u2014 such as the readily available Rhus and Juniperus, as well as lesser-known taxa like Aronia, Diervilla, Prunus, Myrica, Corylus, and Spiraea. Dr. Lubell has conducted wide-ranging research on the subject, including controlled studies on the adaptability of native shrubs, and improved methods of nursery propagation to increase the availability of native taxa. This will be an enlightening program for all who landscape with natives.<\/p> <p><br\/>Dr. Jessica Lubell teaches at the University of Connecticut and has more than 15 years of experience working with the horticulture industry. She was a 2015 recipient of the New England Nursery Association Young Nursery Professional Award for the state of Connecticut. Jessica also enjoys using social media to promote the beauty and utility of native plant landscaping.

Come join the fun!! Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

in at <a href=\"http:\/\/artistfirst.com\/arthurdschwartz.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/artistfirst.com\/arthurdschwartz.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/artistfirst.com\/arthurdschwartz.htm<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>I remember the fanfare of the publication of Erich Von Daniken's <i>Chariots of the Gods<\/i> back in the early 70s (and late 60s I think) and I was immediately captivated by it. From the pyramids of Egypt to those of the Aztecs, or the Nazca Lines in southern Peru I have never felt that they've been adequately explained by conventional archaeology. And the mysteries just seem to keep piling up. And a few years after Von Daniken's first book, Zecharia Sitchin published <i>The 12<\/i><i>th<\/i><i> Planet<\/i> (1976), the first of his Earth Chronicles series in which he interprets the ancient Sumerian writings as providing a narrative of the ancient aliens known as the Anunnaki who traveled to Earth from a planet called Nibiru. During their stay on Earth, human beings were created as hybrids of the aliens and native hominids. Virtually all ancient creation myths from the Bible to the Vedas to the Greek myths can, arguably, be traced to the Sumerian writings. From this perspective, the question of whether ancient aliens have critically influenced human evolution and development is forged!<\/p> <p>My guest, Martin Roy Hill has written a novella, <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1499201737?keywords=Martin%20Roy%20Hill&amp;qid=1443736558&amp;ref_=sr_1_4&amp;sr=8-4\">Eden<\/a><\/i>, that loosely draws on Sitchin's theme, but it is interesting that he does not especially endorse the work of ancient alien theorists. As he wrote to me in a\u00a0 correspondence, \u201c I'm ...not necessarily a believer in the ancient astronaut theory, though I'm open minded about it. The AA theorists bring up a lot of good questions, though I also think they stretch the point sometimes.\u201d So this is going to be a show that will use a fictional work as a starting point for discussion, evidence, conjecture and philosophical rumination from an author who is not entirely sold on the concept. But this, I would like to submit, is the mark of a good writer whose fiction stimulates thought even if he remains skeptical. Indeed, this was also the attitude of Arthur C. Clarke, perhaps the most esteemed science-fiction writer of modern times.<\/p> <p>Martin Roy Hill spent more than 20 years as a staff reporter and editor for newspapers and magazines, before becoming a Navy analyst specializing in battlefield medical operations. His freelance credits include <i>Reader's Digest<\/i>, <i>LIFE<\/i>, <i>Newsweek<\/i>, <i>Omni<\/i>, <i>American History<\/i>, <i>Coast Guard Magazine<\/i>, <i>Retired Officer Magazine<\/i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times Sunday Opinion Section<\/i>, and many more. Much of his freelance work involves historical topics, especially military history. He was a lead contributor to the 1995 WWII anthology, \"From Pearl Harbor to Nagasaki: America at War,\" published by the Retired Officer Association (now called the Military Officer Association). He also contributed to the American Civil War anthology \"Gettysburg: Three Days that Saved the United States,\" published by I-5 Publishing. Martin's short stories have appeared in such publications as <i>Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine<\/i>, <i>ALT HIST: The Journal of Historical Fiction and Alternative History, San Diego Magazine, San Diego Writer's Monthly, <\/i>and the <i>Plan B Mystery Anthology <\/i>and webzine<i>.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>A veteran of the Coast Guard and Navy reserves, Martin now serves as executive officer of a state military police battalion in the California State Military Reserve, a component of the California National Guard. He has also more than 13 years experience in maritime and wilderness search and rescue and disaster response, and taught wilderness survival and first aid.<\/p> <p>Visit Martin's website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.martinroyhill.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.martinroyhill.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.martinroyhill.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>******************<\/p> <p>Your RSVP indicates that you plan on listening to the show.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869032\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbdc","time":1445504400000,"updated":1445517483000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":12.3277387619,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433462918000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are a professional business networking group with 13 members based in Burlington, MA.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The perpetrators are currently leaders in Indonesia and during the documentary did not realize what Oppenheimer was doing. It's an incredible documentary particularly at the end.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In The Missing Picture documentary filmmaker Rithy Panh re-creates atrocities of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979 through stop motion and real footage.

Its language can be found in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights and according to Dan Jones, \u201cthe year 1215 has become in a sense \u2018year zero\u2019 in the story of the struggle for freedom from tyranny.\u201d In Magna Carta, Jones takes us back in time to this turbulent year, when the document in question was just a peace treaty between the third Plantagenet King, John, who was known for his cruelty and instability, and a small group of self-interested and violent barons. Jones brilliantly shows why this document has had such a lasting and international impact that continues to resonate today.<\/p> <p>Dan Jones is the New York Times bestselling author of The Plantagenets: The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England, now a four-part BBC television miniseries, and The Wars of the Roses, due out in October from Penguin, which charts the story of the fall of the Plantagenet dynasty and the improbable rise of the Tudors. Jones lives in London.<\/p> <p><b>$30.00\u00a0 Registration for this event will begin on October 8 at 9:00 a.m.<\/b><\/p> <p>To register, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonathenaeum.org\/events\/2697\/magna-carta\">click here<\/a> and follow the registration button on the right.

It can get overwhelming trying to keep up with all the stories, events, anniversaries, policies, and debates that touch on racial justice in some way. Let's pool our collective knowledge and discuss what's going on - locally, nationally, and globally - within the realm of anti-racism. This will be a great opportunity to share our sources, our stories, and our knowledge to keep everyone informed of the way things are changing, and unfortunately, the many ways in which things are staying the same.<\/p> <p>The topics will change from month to month depending upon what's happening in the world, but many stories may carry over. Have a current event you'd like to discuss at the meeting that isn't listed below? Have a helpful article you'd like to share? Want to look at a story from an unexplored angle? Great!

The memorial is open until 9 pm, which gives us about 2 hours to explore. I have not had any issues with a tripod inside, but be aware that the guards are very adamant about \"proper\" behavior, let's make sure not to aggravate anybody, be respectful, quiet and stay out of the way of people. I chose a Thursday night to avoid the weekend crowds.<\/p> <p><br\/>After the Memorial, we will drive up the subway to Empire State building, which observation platform is open until 2 am. However, they do not allow any tripods, but you can check them at the security checkpoint, if you do not have any option to store it. I recommend that you bring some sort of small monopod (nothing that extends to the ground, but is perhaps a foot long), maybe one of those gorilla pods. If you have a choice of cameras, bring the smaller one, it is easier to steady. The observation platform is surrounded by a metal lattice, which serves to steady the camera and its spacing is wide enough to comfortably shoot through. Make sure not to drop your camera, though. :-) The lattice has varying heights from about 1 ft off the ground to 4 ft.<\/p> <p><br\/>Bring wide angle lenses for the memorial and long lenses or zooms for the Empire State Building. A fisheye will work well in both locations. Lots of cool stuff to zoom into from the Empire State. A small backpack is recommended, the less we carry, the less we will stick out of the crowd. Try a 360\u00b0 view at the memorial or a panorama from the Empire State!<\/p> <p><br\/>Be aware that you will need to go through a thorough security check with metal detector and the Empire State Building charges $32 for the 86th floor platform and $52 for both 86th and 102nd floor (I've never been up there). You can purchase tickets and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esbnyc.com\/\">get a feeling for what to see at this link<\/a>.

Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869034\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbfc","time":1445590800000,"updated":1445603406000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1536 Massachusetts Ave.","name":"Harvard Law School (Pound Hall)","lon":-71.120132,"id":24087267,"state":"MA","lat":42.377472,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.83540344238,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442014357000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This conference is free and open to the public, but seating is limited and registration is required.

Between fifty and eighty percent of all antibiotics sold in the United States are fed to farm animals raised for human consumption\u2013\u2013both to promote animal growth and reduce disease in food-producing livestock living in high-density conditions. This agricultural antibiotic use significantly contributes to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria that affect our ability to treat and prevent human disease, and serious animal welfare concerns exist regarding the concentrated environments this antibiotic use enables. Considerable social and financial costs weigh on both sides of the issue, and the legal system is invoked with each new dispute.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.
