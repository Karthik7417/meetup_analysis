Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period. During the blessing, you just sit in a chair with your eyes closed, listen to beautiful music, and receive multiple transmissions of grace. The experience is often sublime, and always tailored to exactly what it is that you need next in your life.

A happier mom results in a happier baby! :) Come meet other moms and caregivers for bonding, support and friendship!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am a certified yoga and meditation teacher specializing in prenatal and Mommy &amp; Me yoga, and would love to show you how to stay strong throughout your pregnancy and after baby!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We will have meetups for prenatal yoga as well as mommy &amp; baby, depending on interest. Classes will be 1 hour, afterwards we can socialize and munch on yummy snacks. If members would like to host play dates, that would be wonderful too! When the weather gets warmer, we can hold sessions at the park.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Cui's bio:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.gravatar.com\/loveyogi1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/en.gravatar.com\/loveyogi1<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/f\/0\/highres_434176112.jpeg","photo_id":434176112,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/f\/0\/600_434176112.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/e\/f\/0\/thumb_434176112.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10239632,"name":"Cui"},"members":15,"name":"Blissful M-OM (Yoga, treats and play dates)","id":18420509,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Blissfulmomyoga","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Ananda mamas"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423448693000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"networking-leads","name":"Networking Leads","id":16659},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Loft-Cafe-Business-Social-Meetup\/","rating":4,"description":"This is a group for anyone seeking meaningful business connections with the opportunity to formulate friendships at the same time.

RTY is a perfect complement of cardiovascular activity with a gentle Vinyasa flow infused with spirituality. Dahlia has been teaching the Rethink Yoga style of Power Vinyasa since becoming a certified teacher in August 2014. The Rethink Yoga style combines external work (postures and breath) with internal work (cultivating a yogic lifestyle, meditation, and wisdom) creating a practice that encourages students to find their personal power. Always set with an intention of practice, Dahlia\u2019s classes provide a thorough workout while encouraging students to reach out of their comfort zones mentally and physically. Depending on the needs and demand of the students, Dahlia is open to modifying classes towards Gentle flow, Restorative Yoga, Yoga for Men or for private instruction (additional rates apply for private lessons). &nbsp;Cost: $15.00 per class.<\/p>","lon":-74.2300033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":85055362,"name":"Dahlia"},"members":43,"name":"Urban Yogis of Hillside","id":18421486,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Urbanyogis-Hillside-com","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Urban Yogis"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Matawan","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423489495000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"unity","name":"Unity","id":6639},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"prayer","name":"Prayer","id":16040},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"bahai-faith","name":"Baha'i Faith","id":36566}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Matawan-Bahai-Prayer-Study-and-Conversation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"You are welcome to join us for friendly conversation, study, music and devotions guided by the teachings of the Baha'i Faith.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned.

My name is Raphi Salem and I have been organizing professional networking groups for over 20 years. This group started out with a casual lunch networking group for a limited number of industries and individuals but has now expanded to breakfasts and happy hours each month. Breakfast consists of bagels and spreads (please BYO beverage), lunch is BYO (coffee is served) and Happy Hours are cash bars unless we get a sponsor. Every attendee will have a few minutes to speak to the group and provide a brief description of him\/herself. There will also be some time after the meeting for extended networking, if you so chose. Seats are limited to 20, so please RSVP for approval. Our events take place in midtown NYC. <br> <br>Breakfasts every 2nd, 3rd and 4th Thursday at AXA Advisors (1290 Ave of the Americas) 8:15-10am <br>Lunches every 2nd and 4th Thursday at Citrin Cooperman (529 5th Ave) 12:30-2PM <br>Happy Hours Every 3rd or 4th Thursday 6-8PM (Currently at Ainsworth Park (111 East 18th Street) <br> <br>We are also part of a network of a few other meetup groups so feel free to join those as well: <br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Networking-USA\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Networking-...<\/a> <br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entrepreneurs-NYC-Finance-Tech-Mktg-Sales-Expert-Advice\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entrepreneurs-NYC-Fin...<\/a> <br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Small-Business-Owners-Consultants-Salespeople\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Small-Business-Ow...<\/a> <br> <br>If you have any questions, please let me know.

Our last was a lecture on Feb 22, at the SVA Theatre (333 W. 23rd) on the subject of energy. Later, we meet for \u201ccoffee,\u201d for discussion. We have endorsements from NASA scientists for a vital music discovery that we\u2019ve turned into a play, theatre\/music piece\u2014with potential positive ramifications. This segment is called: \"Translators of the Universe.\" The content is new to the music industry, but also includes innovative ideas for living. We meet in the West 80's or at Nola Studios on W. 54th. Prior to 12\/31\/14 we met at Steinway Hall, as many know the Steinwway company has moved. We convene 2-3 times a week to move our project forward. We are hoping to augment our team with people who have interest in classical music, theatre, and healthy living. We meet to exchange ideas that might enhance the project, have dinner, and involves a social meetup. I thought the MeetUp group might infuse energy into our project. Having volunteered for Musica Sacra (choral music), the U.N. and other organizations, we model our meetings to include a healthy dinner while brain-storming ideas for a national release of our passion, Breaking The Rules. The cast includes 3, but we do also need actors who can step in, and lots of participation from a committee.

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille"},"members":98,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp; Like Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, and Richard Branson we know how important public speaking can be to our professional and personal success.&nbsp; But similar to sleeping and eating, our busy schedules don't always allow us to devote enough time to it.&nbsp; The goal of Speech Partiers is to make public speaking fun and to hack the learning process.&nbsp; We do activities inspired by both the power of neuroscience and the power of crowdsourcing to speed up our progress.&nbsp; Welcome to the party!&nbsp; <\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/highres_434226136.jpeg","photo_id":434226136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/600_434226136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/f\/8\/thumb_434226136.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":114208432,"name":"Shannon"},"members":220,"name":"Speech Party: Busy People Speed-Learn Public Speaking","id":18427559,"state":"NY","urlname":"Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Speech Partiers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423670840000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"witi","name":"Women in Technology","id":10296},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"bootstrap","name":"Bootstrap","id":19373},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5","id":78565},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"women-in-tech","name":"Women in tech","id":220771},{"urlkey":"swift-language","name":"Swift Language","id":1486112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Tech-Training-For-Women-In-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Training for Employment in an Executive or Computer Professional Capacity<\/p>\n<p>You start out as Exempt from Dues.

All our members know that our club is the best place you can learn communication and leadership skills in both English and Japanese. We have accomplished the \"Distinguished Toastmasters Club Award\" 5 years in a row. This award is given by Toastmasters International to the clubs that accomplished at least 5 of its specified goals. Not only is our club effective, but it is so much fun that it\u2019s addictive! Our membership is open to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills in a culturally diverse environment. We meet in mid-town Manhattan twice a month, and in each meeting, we run two sessions; first in English and then in Japanese. However, you do not need to speak Japanese and you are very welcome to participate in the English session only. Our club provides a friendly and supportive environment where you can build up confidence with each speaking assignment. By regularly presenting a speech in front of like-minded professionals, you will soon find yourself speaking in a more relaxed and confident manner to the board of directors, to your customers or even in job interviews! Feel free to join us as a guest and see for yourself how it works.

Mastermind groups offer a combination of brainstorming, education, peer accountability, and support in a group setting to sharpen your business and personal skills. The main purpose of this group is to hold each member accountable to her goals, provide access to information\/resources, and support. How may we serve you? <br><\/p>\n<p>This group is for success-minded ladies who take full responsibility for their lives and are focused on solutions. We are made up of a diverse array of women.

Each lady will take a turn and speak about what she is working on, goals, and with what she needs help. Whenever a person is speaking, everybody else will be respectful and listen to her without judgment. Then for the next 20-30 minutes, the rest of us will brainstorm, share ideas, solutions, and constructive feedback towards a solution for her. Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other.

Others experienced better improvement in body shape and natural weight loss compared to routinely going to the gym 3-4x\/week. Most people also enjoy feeling more refreshed and energetic in their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.natural-walking.com\">Secrets of Natural Walking<\/a> So Effective?<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.natural-walking.com\">Secrets of Natural Walking<\/a> (SONW) is a very natural walking therapy, giving various extraordinary benefits for body shape, health and even for our internal organs, thoughts and mood, without any side effects at all. SONW is very beneficial for people of all ages even for seniors. SONW is beneficial for those who both in ill and good health.<\/p>\n<p><span><b>We do not walk properly<\/b><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>All of the known benefits from these various researches are only a minor part of the true benefits we can achieve from walking. The true benefits have not yet been achieved because most people still do not walk properly. <br> <br>What\u2019s the proof? Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities. However,&nbsp; because the improper way we walk, use our body and improper posture, many of these natural healing abilities are not functioning maximally or even completely stopped.<\/p>\n<p>Our bodies that have the amazing natural healing abilities are also equipped with the most natural way to correct\/reactivate these natural healing abilities is the most natural way. Something most humans do everyday.<\/p>\n<p>What is that?&nbsp;<b>WALKING<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Beyond a simple step<\/b><\/p>\n<p>For those who do not know, eating is just to fill the stomach. On the contrary, our body needs various nutrition from the food that we eat. The same with walking. Every proper step will naturally adjust our legs, muscles, joints, spine, and through the meridians and reflexology zones cleanse all blockages and reactivate the natural healing functions, improving our overall health including our internal organs.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.8499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/2\/7\/highres_438642535.jpeg","photo_id":438642535,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/2\/7\/600_438642535.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/2\/7\/thumb_438642535.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8807880,"name":"Ann"},"members":116,"name":"Secrets of Natural Walking of NYC - Unofficial","id":18452701,"state":"NY","urlname":"SecretsofNaturalWalkingNYC","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Natural Walkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424621897000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"teachers","name":"Teachers","id":391},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"education","name":"Education","id":8476},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"conversation","name":"Conversation","id":15099},{"urlkey":"makers","name":"Makers","id":43887},{"urlkey":"makerspaces","name":"Makerspaces","id":101438},{"urlkey":"3d-printing","name":"3D Printing","id":114528},{"urlkey":"education-innovation","name":"Education innovation","id":687092},{"urlkey":"fab-lab","name":"Fab lab","id":1478602}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/k12-Making-and-Learning-Institute\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling all K-12 Makers!

To help meet these needs the talks in church for the period March 1 through May 24 are meant to give away spiritual treasure discovered in our tradition for people to use as they will.&nbsp; The series of talks is entitled, \"Spirituality when Religion Fails\".&nbsp; It seeks to be insightful, relevant, practical and nurturing.<\/p>\n<p>The core of our community is, of course, those who choose to follow the teachings of Christ according to the understanding of the Episcopal Church, yet we hope also to be a place where community, thoughtful reflection, spiritual practice, friendship and support are available&nbsp;for those who do not really want a \"church\" or&nbsp;\"religion\".&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because this place is for our whole community,&nbsp;and we respect people to make their best decisions for themselves.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because when people personally invest in their spiritual life we trust that good will happen.<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/8\/7\/highres_434723687.jpeg","photo_id":434723687,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/8\/7\/600_434723687.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/c\/8\/7\/thumb_434723687.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":128501352,"name":"John M Hamilton"},"members":57,"name":"Drinking Deeply from the Well","id":18465286,"state":"NY","urlname":"Music-and-Reflection-for-Spiritual-Refreshment-Yonkers","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"People Thirsty for Life!"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425054189000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"selfdefense","name":"Self-Defense","id":443},{"urlkey":"martial","name":"Martial Arts","id":681},{"urlkey":"western-martial-arts","name":"Western Martial Arts","id":15987},{"urlkey":"shotokan-karate","name":"Shotokan Karate","id":22727},{"urlkey":"internal-martial-arts","name":"Internal Martial Arts","id":28022},{"urlkey":"japanese-karate","name":"Japanese Karate","id":36211},{"urlkey":"traditional-karate","name":"Traditional Karate","id":36212}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Zendankai-Shotokan-Karate-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for people interested in Japanese traditional Karate or martial arts in general.

I like to try to get out of town (and even out of the country) once or twice a year. Traveling on our own gets lonely - teenagers, especially, are really much happier when they have the company of other kids\/young people. So we have been experimenting with group travel. So far, we've taken one tour designed for families, and are planning to take two others in the coming year. While the tour we took was quite good in some ways, it would have been better if there were more families like ours (the tour was mainly composed of large extended family groups with two parents, grandparents, etc.). I thought it might be nice to gather other single parents (meaning single, divorced, or widowed - anyone traveling as one parent with one or more children) facing the same trip planning issues and share our experiences and maybe even - if it really works out - figuring out how to join up for group travel. I'm not interested in camping or low-budget type of tours, so I specified \"high-end\" (meaning very good tour group, really good accommodations, etc.). So we'll have to see who signs up. If there's interest, maybe we can then set up a meeting somewhere and talk over coffee or brunch and see where it goes from there. Depending on what's most convenient, if we do meet, we can do it somewhere that's centrally located in the Greater New York area (maybe in Manhattan).<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":131857822,"name":"Marthe"},"members":90,"name":"Single Parents Interested in High-End Family Group Travel","id":18469538,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Parents-Interested-in-High-End-Family-Group-Travel","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Single parents looking to travel"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425235263000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing","name":"Affiliate Marketing","id":15899},{"urlkey":"pay-per-click","name":"Pay Per Click","id":17602},{"urlkey":"cpa-marketing","name":"CPA Marketing","id":20233},{"urlkey":"facebook-marketing","name":"Facebook Marketing","id":66499},{"urlkey":"affiliate-marketing-ecommerce","name":"Affiliate Marketing (Ecommerce)","id":141895}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Affiliate-Marketing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"This is a group for AFFILIATE MARKETERS ONLY.

They need to interact with other girls their age who they can relate to. It's even harder for single moms to understand the changes and to deal with it. We need to be educated and be there to support our daughters at this crucial time. I'm a single mother, with an 11 year old so I understand. We will get together, have outings that all have teachings of how to love themselves and to feel beautiful just the way they are, Diva Spa treatments, cooking classes, Liberty Science Center, Circus, fashion shows, and much more. Most activities are comp but may ask for a small fee for organization. Transportation for 6 individuals ( mom and one preteen preferable) may be provided depending on location availability. After each meeting there will be Preteens Get Togethers Rock packages for a very small fee of $5 available for moms and daughters to interact together and to give mom pointers of how to deal with our Preteens even when we are not meeting, which is very beneficial for our Preteens. We will meet once a week, possibly on the weekends for I know weekdays are hard for some working moms. Please note: There may be some activities that may repeat for families who missed outings and request, but never in the same month or the following month. &nbsp;All cultures and diversities are welcomed.

With over 1,800 current members internationally, the opportunities and benefits of membership continue to attract people from all over the globe.

The process of local involvement and self determination is an important benefit of membership.<\/p>\n<p>Member participation in national conferences held annually across the country has provided the practical fabric of a rapidly growing network of diverse grant professionals. Each year, GPA's conference provide timely and informative workshops, round-table discussions, member receptions, funder panels, vendor exhibits and the popular individual proposal review sessions are all available to registered attendees. Additionally, the opportunity to network with peers from around the globe, listen to the keynote address, and participate in the annual membership meetings ensure that possibilities abound at this exciting event.<\/p>\n<p>Fostering a constant critical eye on the current state of the craft, the GPA Journal (published annually) provides a forum for book and article reviews, discussions on best practices, and scholarly examination of the state of the profession. The member\u2019s electronic forum provides another venue for the exchange of ideas, issues, methodologies and other relevant discourse on a member-to-member basis.<\/p>\n<p>For the long term, GPA continues to lead the efforts to establish a formal credentialing process.

The purpose of our meetings is to foster community among people using Hadoop in production, provide an opportunity to learn about interesting and relevant use cases, and hear about some challenges of using Hadoop in production and how people address them. Meetings will be held in NYC on a regular basis. Pepperdata delivers predictability, increasing performance, and visibility for business-critical Hadoop jobs on existing clusters running multiple applications. Pepperdata's software makes every Hadoop node more efficient, allowing companies to run more jobs on the existing infrastructure. Pepperdata was founded in 2012 by Sean Suchter and Chad Carson, former Yahoo executives whose groups were the first two users of Hadoop in production even before it was called Hadoop.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13285151,"name":"Nadine"},"members":481,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.

So far we have averaged around 2 per week.<br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue.<br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity. I will cover all the meetup fees for now. If anyone wants to contribute feel free to but for now I am not going to ask.<\/p>\n<p> 4).

The current power structure will have you believe that all that exists is the physical world before your eyes. Yet, they use spiritual and other supernatural means to control and dominate the planet all the while conspiring to limit your potential as a divine being. They have subversively replaced our moral values given to us by our ancient ancestors with the worship of satanism, sex, money, materialism, militarism, power, racism, and sexism. They have further replaced true spiritualism with religious dogma and the belief in the five senses (physical existence) only. In fact, they are the chief architects of many of the planets conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Project Illuminated is a global effort to reveal the truth of our existence and show you how to create a new reality. One where you don't need to protest, amass a military like arsenal of weapons or get into wars to change the direction of the world. The powerful and free information as presented through this group will reveal the secrets of the universe that will help revolutionize our current thought process.

To find your dance is to find yourself at your most fluid and creative level. While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself. The five rhythms are: Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice. Rather than having steps to follow, each rhythm is a different energy field in which you find you own expression and choreography, thereby stretching your imagination as well as your body. Each rhythm is a teacher and you can expect to meet different and sometimes unknown aspects of yourself as your dance unfolds and your practice of the rhythms deepens over time. What to expect \/ what happens in class? In every class or workshop, there is always a wide range of experience in the 5Rhythms work, from first-timers to certified Wave addicts. In any given class, the teacher will be following the energy of the room. So, while the essential map is one of five rhythms, the teacher might take the class through the entire Wave or focus on just one rhythm or one facet of the rhythm. The rhythms themselves are gateways to literally thousands of different movement landscapes. Like the body, they are alive and designed to catalyze the dancer\u2019s movement expression in the moment. You are different every time you walk into the room; so is the group and so is your teacher. Therefore, each class holds completely unique possibilities. Class is located at the beautiful studios of Hamilton Health and Fitness (HHF), at 161 Erie Street (by Hamilton Park). HHF is a unique fitness center, offering integrated services for the body, mind and soul. Class cost: No charge for full members or HHF $20 for non-members $15 for non-member students and seniors","lon":-74.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":24485922,"name":"Jilsarah"},"members":23,"name":"Release: A 5Rhythms\u00ae Event in Jersey City","id":18489513,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Release-A-5Rhythms-Event-in-Jersey-City","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Valhalla","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425941365000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"mommy-me","name":"Mommy and Me","id":18014}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-Weekend-Mommy-Me-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a meetup group for toddlers and their mommies!

You feel gratitude when you receive a gift; you express your gratitude by paying it forward.

Whether your requests are granted will depend on who's in the Circle and what resources they can call on. <br><\/p>\n<p>- <b>Offering gifts<\/b> - What do you want to give to the community as a whole, or to one or more people within the community? You might offer a jar of pickles, a hug, a bike, friendship, a couch to crash on, a ride to the airport, guitar lessons, sewing help, a job, a home-cooked meal, an E-reader, or (again) anything at all! <br><\/p>\n<p>- <b>Expressing gratitude<\/b> - What do you feel grateful for?

It\u2019s about connecting to life in its purest form \u2014 breath. It\u2019s about the union of your mind, body, and spirit. My amazing teacher calls laughter yoga, \"THE HAPPINESS WORKOUT\" and says that it is a form of \u201cedu-tainment\u201d designed to relieve stress and cultivate joy through a fun mix of mind-body exercises. All it takes is an open mind and a willingness to let go. Your body doesn\u2019t know the difference between spontaneous and induced laughter. So, even forced laughter produces endorphins and decreases cortisol\u2014instant benefits for your mood and stress levels. Before you know it, fake laughter turns into real guttural belly laughs. That\u2019s when the really good stuff gets released! Doing that on a regular basis actually re-wires your brain toward positivity. Benefits of Laughter Yoga Good Mood and More Laughter: Laughter Yoga helps to change your mood within minutes by releasing certain chemicals from your brain cells called endorphins. You will remain cheerful and in a good mood throughout the day and will laugh more than you normally do. Healthy Exercise to Beat Stress: Laughter Yoga is like an aerobic exercise (cardio workout) which brings more oxygen to the body and brain thereby making one feel more energetic and relaxed. Health Benefits: Laughter Yoga reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system.You will not fall sick easily and if you have some chronic health conditions, you will heal faster. Quality of Life: Laughter is a positive energy which helps people to connect with other people quickly and improves relationships. If you laugh more, you will attract many friends. Positive Attitude in Challenging Times : Everyone can laugh when life is good, but how does one laugh when faced with challenges? Laughter helps to create a positive mental state to deal with negative situations and negative people. It gives hope and optimism to cope with difficult times. How does Laughter Yoga work? Most of the Laughter in a Laughter Yoga session is initiated in the group with full body laughter exercises, clapping, eye contact and youthful playfulness. The \"simulated\" laughter soon turns into real, spontaneous and contagious laughter that brings much more oxygen to our body and brain, lifting our spirits and carrying over into our work, school and social lives. We will also end with a chocolate yum meditation. Dr Kataria who is the brain child behind laughter yoga says the 5 benefits of laughter yoga are : 1. Good Mood and more laughter 2. Healthy Exercise to beat stress ( and who couldnt use a little less stress in their life) 3. Health benefits ; lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. Help beat depression, chronic pain issues ...the possibilities are endless 4. Quality of life improves, you are able to connect with people more and on a more true and intimate level 5. Positive in Challenging times **All this just from laughing!** Come once or come every week for this amazing experience. All ages are welcome!<\/p>","lon":-74.1699981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/d\/9\/highres_435280665.jpeg","photo_id":435280665,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/d\/9\/600_435280665.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/d\/9\/thumb_435280665.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":99647242,"name":"Christine"},"members":164,"name":"Laughter Yoga with Chocolate Yum Meditation","id":18492570,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Laughter-Yoga-with-Christine","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.3899993896,"who":"Laughter Yoga Beings"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1426040494000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"mambo-dancing","name":"Mambo Dancing","id":19661},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"salsa-dance-lessons","name":"Salsa Dance Lessons","id":39135},{"urlkey":"kizomba","name":"Kizomba","id":60405},{"urlkey":"salsa-lessons-bachata-lessons","name":"Salsa Lessons & Bachata Lessons","id":63910},{"urlkey":"bachata-dancing","name":"Bachata dancing","id":87267},{"urlkey":"zouk","name":"zouk","id":91658},{"urlkey":"mambo-salsa-bachata-dancing-and-classes","name":"Mambo-Salsa-Bachata Dancing and Classes","id":152037},{"urlkey":"hustle-partner-dance-lessons","name":"Hustle (partner) Dance Lessons","id":165765},{"urlkey":"salsa-on2","name":"Salsa ON2","id":609312},{"urlkey":"new-york-style-salsa","name":"New York Style Salsa","id":609322},{"urlkey":"on2-dancing","name":"ON2 Dancing","id":609332}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Balmirs-Dance-Studio\/","rating":5,"description":"Balmir Latin Dance Studio based out of Flatbush, Brooklyn would like to welcome you to one of our various styles of classes we offer.

You are the author of your life. Art completes you and that completion will allow you to create either the life you want or paint from your authentic self. You will have the inspiration and energy after our meet ups. Your constant Self doubt made you forget that you are a possibility. You will learn the practices that you can do on your own so you can continue your own expansion. Materials you might need: 1. If you already know that you will continue your practice please invest into a new and awesome multi media sketch book. We will turn it into your own text book and a book of personal inspiration and guidance. If not, loose paper is good too. 2. Colors that you choose matter. If you can afford good quality colors that have a better pigment please get them. Focus only on the colors that attract you if you are buying them separately. 3. Avoid oils an acrylic for this introductory workshop for easy clean up. 4. My suggestion would be to include markers and pencils and watercolors and tempera or quashes. Tempera and quashes will allow more vibrancy in your work. Watercolors is a great idea if you like soft and tender art, 8. Brushes of different sizes would be good. I would not suggest spending a lot of money on the expensive brushes yet. I will talk about other courses I teach or promote like Modern Breakthrough for women, Vedic Art, Paint Your Private Sessions, Meditation Meetups and Science of Completion workshops. I noticed that these session facilitate the artistic progress and I find them very relevant to your artistic growth.

After you engage in this crazy collective of expression and encouragement, you will morph into a super-human that everyone will be able to remember.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.remembermegroup.com\/\">http:\/\/www.remembermegroup.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>What do we do?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We provide affordable life coaching to students, young-pros, entrepreneurs, and visionaries interested in improving their personal success and business. Really, we would help anyone so hungry to take action &nbsp;that they are open enough to meet with us for guidance.<\/p>\n<p><span><b>What does that mean?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>You're about to feel the most excitement you've ever felt in your life. Working with a life coach, you'll have someone asking you all the right questions, shining light on what you want, and help you find strategies that work with your lifestyle to make things possible. Key word - You. Although you can hire us to do some of the work for you, we love to lead the horse to the water so it can drink for life (if you catch our drift). Feel free to ask us what our extra services are!<\/p>\n<p><b>Are these group meetings?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Guess what - this is anything you want it to be. For the love of networking you'll see us set up brainstorming sessions, but most of our members prefer to schedule a one-on-one meeting to be selfish and talk all about themselves for an hour (which we 100% love and encourage). If you like to pick brains and see how others work, group meet-ups are for you, but if you want to get the most of your meetings, one-on-ones are perfect to hone in on what you want so you can leave with tons of material to work with.<\/p>\n<p><b>Where do you meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our New York staple is any Think Coffee shop. We've also met at hotel lounges, and other coffee bars. Feel free to share some of your favorite spots to meet. We love shaking it up!<\/p>\n<p>Best part, you can schedule phone calls. Most of our super-humans have jobs and would like to set up a call when it's most convenient for them. This way you make the most of your time, and can handle business at home in your PJ's and easily jump in and out of our meeting. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What does it cost and how do we pay?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Best $30 you will spend on yourself for an hour of coaching.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All meetings will be finalized once you pay through&nbsp;Paypal&nbsp;(katiegonzalez@bellsouth.net).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we meet in person and you do not have&nbsp;Paypal, cash is&nbsp;accepted.<\/p>\n<p><b>How effective is this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>One meeting is inspiring. Setting up a month long plan will get you results. Ask us about our challenges.<\/p>\n<p><b>How do both meetings work?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>Meetings are driven to inspire action. We examine what exists, list what needs to be incorporated and improved, plan priorities, and tackle one goal at a time.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>Turning an idea into reality is fun, and we want our clients to feel confident every time we meet. You can think out loud, be messy, find a center and then piece together how you can make things happen. We believe our process will help you achieve great results. <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>1. <b>Talk<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is your time to be selfish and talk all about all things you and how you want to start developing your vision.<\/p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<b>Define<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Next, we pin-point your priorities based off of what you\u2019ll see instant results from, and work up to the tougher goals you\u2019re intimidated to tackle.

If you're someone who has been curious about intuition but turned off by the \"woo-woo\", then you're in the right place.

In these practices, profound spiritual and healing wisdom are used to return a person to their natural fully healthy state. Culturally there has never been a more challenging time in society and the need for these practices is vital. Through US Siddha Science Center, these exceptional series of programs for healing are now available in the New York metropolitan area. We believe that through experience and meditation, we can experience that which is beyond all experiences. Stepping into spirituality is a stepping into reality\u2026 that is, the true you\u2026 Realizing the true Self is said to be the ultimate goal of life which is called moksha or enlightment.

We celebrate in tribute to our bountiful existence and each element which contributes to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Join us in our mission to help progress our race through service, action and celebration. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We operate through two distinct but united pieces of a whole. The World Celebrationist Society and its community organization, the United Celebrationist Movement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The World Celebrationist Society offers services in advocacy for the abandoned and embattled, support in sponsoring and organizing celebrations of all types, offering financial aid to those in need and working to support segments of society which might be neglected.<\/p>\n<p>Our organization&nbsp;works toward a society of greater understanding and acts toward cultural contribution and learning for the sake of a more understanding and tolerant world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The WCS also recruits and trains a version of public ministers, known as advocates. These individuals minister on behalf of Celebrationist philosophy to all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, history or status. We strive to offer a home, be it spiritual or otherwise to anybody that might want one or might feel like they don't have one elsewhere. We gladly offer both spiritual and non-spiritual ritual services such as weddings, funerals, humanistic counseling or even basic human company in a person's time of need. The World Celebrationist Society also offers services in assisting people in finding a spiritual home outside of Celebrationism if they feel like our philosophical element isn't quite the right fit. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Registered members of Celebrationism pay an annual $59.00 contribution and enjoy voting privileges, rights to serve on the Celebrationist Council or Chancery, free classes related to religion, philosophy, culture and free admission to WCS public events and celebrations around the world. All dues collected from registered members go toward our missions and operational costs. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The UCM<\/p>\n<p>The UCM is the World Celebrationist Society's free community organization that brings people who adopt the teachings of Celebrationism and the Pillars of Faith that we're built on. These community get togethers are meant to unite people in celebration, service and unity on the back of the Celebrationist Pillars of Faith. These organizations are sponsored and managed by the World Celebrationist Society to promote community celebration, interfaith unity and public service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The World Celebrationist Society proudly hosts UCM Meetups around the United States and England. We're currently recruiting regional organizers to help organize UCM events in local communities in both countries. We are also recruiting candidates to be ordained as Celebrationist advocates throughout the world.

Even still, for others, we are a project of intercommunal relationship and movements of spiritual discovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our purpose, quite plainly, is to create a more vibrant, tolerant, and understanding world.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to meet this goal by championing ideas of goodness.&nbsp;The World Celebrationist Society is the home of all people regardless of who they are, where they're from or what is in their history.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to serve as the unapologetic champions and advocates of all persons. We embrace members without exclusion in the spirit of compassion, forgiveness and the promotion of growth and progress. We celebrate in tribute to our bountiful existence and each element which contributes to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the ideas that we teach are organic within us, but are not always easily fulfilled. Working through education, service, advocacy, celebration, support and exploration to fulfill and promote these good notions is our mission.<\/p>\n<p>Some choose to find the strength to meet these purposes with the aid of spirituality, others don't. Our organizations welcomes both groups of people. We do this simply because the operations that bring us further into goodness are inconsequential, for it is the goodness that is most imperative to sustaining the health of the world and offering comfort to its people.<\/p>\n<p>Every member of Celebrationism and its governmental body of service, the World Celebrationist Society, are encouraged to celebrate in their own individual way, in their respective forward journey of growth. In this idea comes great diversity in how each element of our mission and teachings are interpreted, and in many ways, that is quite precisely what we're all about. This visionary project is a tribute to that very spirit of complex diversity in humanity and the layered nature of individuality, with a respect for the common bonds that bring us together, in recognition of all the boundless potential, wonder and goodness that is &nbsp;inherent to our existence.<\/p>\n<p>We help realize these ideas through a special observation of the promotion of growth, positive gesture, philosophical action, celebration and active appreciation for the abundant wonders of our existence, both in the slightest nuance and the most blatant display of greatness - be it in nature, human achievement, art, sport, experience, gesture or anything else.<\/p>\n<p>We celebrate in silent, private appreciation and in open festivals of dedication and honor. We teach the importance of inclusive acceptance, forgiveness and personal growth, and we do it all in the spirit of celebrating the life we have the privilege of learning from, pleasuring in and in journey to a more richly happy life for all those burdened and blessed by this very experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit us at www.ucm.center<\/p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/highres_435866147.jpeg","photo_id":435866147,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/600_435866147.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/2\/3\/thumb_435866147.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":175339562,"name":"Michael"},"members":27,"name":"The United Celebrationist Movement - New York","id":18519228,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-United-Celebrationist-Movement-New-York","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Celebrationists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427264208000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"scifi","name":"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy","id":317},{"urlkey":"cosplay","name":"Cosplay","id":640},{"urlkey":"comics","name":"Comic Books","id":794},{"urlkey":"manga","name":"Manga","id":2849},{"urlkey":"videogame","name":"Video Games","id":4471},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"geek","name":"Geek Culture","id":10493},{"urlkey":"birthday-parties","name":"Birthday Parties","id":15375},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"japanese-anime-cosplay","name":"Anime Cosplay","id":30363},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"geeks-nerds","name":"Geeks & Nerds","id":32623},{"urlkey":"anime-conventions","name":"Anime Conventions","id":52002},{"urlkey":"anime-and-cosplay","name":"Anime and Cosplay","id":65769}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/f\/0\/7\/600_439588423.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Anime fans &amp; Super Smash Bros (Wii U) fans unite!

Is your Fiance is on her way over to New york in the next couple of months? You both can join this group and take advice or ask questions in our discussion group.  But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo"},"members":22,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic<br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp;<br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity. For my personal work, I always publish creative commons, unless I included copy write material granted to me specifically for my production. Musicians and Sound engineers are badly needed.<\/p>\n<p>FYI <\/p>\n<p>BE PREPARED!&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Federal and State hearings for unpopular infrastructure projects happen many times in the dead of winter, on the coldest evening with virtually no public transit access.&nbsp; When I was at the Queens meeting it was dark and in the teens,&nbsp; I could not imagine any elderly person or sane person taking a multi-link trip to that location, and saw none waiting at bus stop.<\/p>If you want to be on the short list of people to be notified of short notice events, contact me.&nbsp; I always announce on the website, but sometimes less than 24 hours are given in advance notice. \n<br>","lon":-74.2799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/highres_435731433.jpeg","photo_id":435731433,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/600_435731433.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/a\/9\/thumb_435731433.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119445962,"name":"Leland  T.

A bit about moi: in my 20s, a musician, somewhat trans and going by the name Michael, can't understand why GAY can't encompass all of us, especially queer. I consider myself a queer a a result of how I dress and interact with the gender I am attracted to. In being trans, I am particularly interested in talking with trans folk who are truly \"open\", and thus not black and white, and thus, who would be open to discussing more of our estate in being trans, and what it means, and why and what we feel.

NOW YOU CAN! BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE RITE MINDSET. Welcome to the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training Meetup. This free meetup will show you how to transform your life for the better by way of learning how to bring out your inner warrior. THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE IS TO RELEASE YOUR INNER WARRIOR. My goal is to help people generate the energy and the mind-set necessary to become Warriors in Entrepreneurship. I am an Online Marketing mentor, Motivational Speaker and the mastermind behind the Mushindo Mind-set. I created the Mushindo Mind-Set to help bring out the inner Warrior in all hard-core Entrepreneurs. Through my study of both business and martial arts, I have honed my understanding of what it takes to get what you really want out of life. Education is only one part of the equation, however. I have now turned my knowledge into power by implementing powerful strategies from world-renowned authors such as Miyamoto Musashi, Bruce Lee, Robert Kiosiki, Napoleon Hill and many others into my own life and career. Now, my goal is to give life-changing knowledge and super-human skills at the Entrepreneurship Lifestyle training. By implementing The Law of Attraction principles, Martial Arts Philosophy, and all-powerful Alchemic thinking I can teach anyone with a desire for a better life how to attain it by culling their inner Warrior. Come meet my team of qualified pros and be a part of this amazing life-changing seminar to truly become a Successful Entrepreneurial Warrior.<\/p>","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185615223,"name":"Shogun Rivera"},"members":50,"name":"ENTREPRENEURIAL WARRIORS","id":18526772,"state":"NJ","urlname":"WARRIORWITHIN","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8899993896,"who":"Entrepreneurial Warrior"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427757148000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"mobile-web","name":"Mobile Web","id":78586},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951},{"urlkey":"app-developers","name":"App developers","id":303571},{"urlkey":"developing-mobile-apps","name":"Developing Mobile Apps","id":321161},{"urlkey":"open-source-community","name":"Open Source Community","id":729302},{"urlkey":"appreneurs","name":"Appreneurs","id":1068262},{"urlkey":"mobile-app-development","name":"Mobile App Development","id":1068282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Source-Apps-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A meet-up for for developers and entrepreneurs working to create open source apps.

The Last Minute Gourmet will be 90 percent midweek dinner events and a younger demographic than the Single Gourmet (but since we are pre-launch, I need to get some running ground by partnering with my current group). Being in pre-launch, I am offering some great discounts to new members that have NEVER been offered in our 33 years, which are free dinners if you sign up for full membership and dinner credits for inviting friends to become members. I also have a dinner group on facebook with over 600 members, that I will try to merge into The Last Minute Gourmet events soon. What i found with my facebook group is that people are non committal and collecting money for dinners is not easy.

Do you like smiling, laughing and interacting with friendly folks out for a good time? Getting some healthy exercise while having fun? Contra dancing might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Contra dancing is a fun, easy-to-learn style of social dance accompanied by a live band. Knowing how to dance is not necessary because a caller prompts the moves and guides the dancers. A workshop is given prior to the start to learn basic terminology and some of the dance moves.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the dance moves are identical to those in square dancing. People who learned some square dancing in elementary school\u2014even a few decades ago\u2014often pick up the basics of contra dancing quickly. And even if you\u2019ve never danced before, contra is one of the easiest kinds of dancing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the music is drawn from Appalachian, Celtic, and old-timey traditions, with pop, jazz, Eastern European and electric for good measure. From lively and playful to smooth and elegant, the music always has a great beat enhanced by the collective energy of joyful dancers.<\/p>\n<p>Many couples and singles attend the dances, and it's customary to dance with a variety of partners throughout an evening. Typically at a dance there are 40 to 80 people of varied experience levels, ages and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Swingin' Tern hosts contra dancing the first and third Saturdays of every month.

We meet quarterly at the Rutgers Inn and Conference Center in New Brunswick, NJ. This Meetup group is sponsored by DEVOLUTIONS (http:\/\/www.devolutions.com) The VMware User Group (VMUG) is an independent, global, customer-led organization, created to maximize members\u2019 use of VMware and partner solutions through knowledge sharing, training, collaboration, and events. The VMware User Group is a user community - of the users, by the users, for the users. Through an independent global VMUG, we believe we can strengthen our collective VMware and VMUG value proposition through expanded collaboration, member programs, and benefits. The independent global VMUG organization was officially launched in August of 2010. Prior to that point, VMUG chapters had operated locally with the support of VMware. These local groups grew rapidly \u2013 membership increased 234% in 2008-2009 alone. Because of this unparalleled growth, a decision was made to bring all of these chapters together under one global VMUG umbrella operating independently of VMware. The organization benefits the membership and VMware by: Ensuring a consistent and high quality experience for all VMUG members - Providing a more effective interface between VMware and our customer base Creating a cohesive network of VMware customers and partners with a collective voice capable of impacting VMware products and services Establishing a support system and business model that allows the local VMUG leaders and VMware to move beyond tactical support into more strategic initiatives In early 2010, a steering committee of VMUG chapter leaders was formed to chart the course for the launch and development of the global VMUG organization. From that steering committee, an inaugural volunteer Board of Directors was formed and the new global VMUG was launched to the membership at VMworld 2010.","lon":-74.4499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185931941,"name":"NJ VMUG"},"members":81,"name":"New Jersey VMware User Group Meetup","id":18537006,"state":"NJ","urlname":"New-Jersey-VMware-User-Group-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.4900016785,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428420940000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"spain","name":"Spain","id":16630},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-restaurants","name":"Exploring New Restaurants","id":20704},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"wine-and-tapas","name":"Wine and Tapas","id":33574},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"spanish-food","name":"Spanish Food","id":46429},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548},{"urlkey":"tapas","name":"Tapas","id":170489},{"urlkey":"authentic-paella","name":"Authentic Paella","id":1494802}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Food-of-Spain-meetup-group\/","rating":0,"description":"Ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9!!

This is also where the method is 'revolutionary': while many methods recommend spending hours at the gym, the Lafay Method has a different approach with less time for equivalent results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you move along in the program, It will help you to maintain your upper body in better shape and develop the core muscles of your body. In the long run, it will definitely help you: you will feel less sore and probably run faster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I discovered this method 2 years ago. Within only 2 months I felt a real change, it improved my fitness level significantly by increasing my core strength and my flexibility. So far, I have not seen any disadvantages: no gym fee, easy, no need to wait for a machine and I can practice even when traveling! I train 3 times a week (Macombs Dam Park, by the Yankee Stadium), and I will be pleased to give back to anyone what I learned and gained from that method on how to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Contact me through here or at bournery@gmail.com !

Join me and a wonderful group of friendly, non-judgmental men for some shopping at the Grand Army Farmers Market, followed by a picnic in Prospect Park. This is a fun, social way to do your grocery shopping and then hang out and meet new people for a picnic. Plus, if you're a first-time shopper at the market, I'm happy to help you navigate it and learn more about the whole foods they offer. I'll put out some free produce and cheese for the picnic, and others can pitch whatever they'd like to make it a feast. This is super casual, so feel free to bring a frisbee, instrument, blanket, etc. I'll bring a cooler for you to store any cold foods you bought at the market, plus I'll bring some cups and drinks (let's keep this alcohol-free!). This is all about building a cool community, meeting new people, being supportive, eating local, quality food and kicking off the weekend with some positivity. Why not avoid the brunch wait, and instead come enjoy the sun, fresh air, and good company?

Our mission is to provide progressive activists and professionals with a mutually supportive and positive learning environment in which every member has the opportunity to develop communications and leadership skills, which in turn foster self-confidence and personal growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What happens At a Greenspeakers meeting?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our meetings generally start with an inspirational welcome message from a club member who introduces the Toastmaster for the evening. The Toastmaster is the Master of Ceremonies and leads us through the rest of the agenda.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a typical agenda:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Introductions: Each person briefly introduces herself or himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Agenda review: An experienced member explains what happens in the different parts of the meeting for the benefit of newcomers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Word of the day: A member presents us with an unusual word, defines it, uses it in several sentences, and challenges us to use it during the course of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Table Topics: An experienced member reads from a list of prepared questions and calls on members of the audience to give one-to-two minute responses. The questions aren't difficult; they are intended to give us a chance to practice speaking without preparation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Prepared Speeches: Two or three members deliver speeches that they have prepared in advance. These speeches can be about any subject, but they generally fall into one of ten categories defined by Toastmasters International. Most speeches are between five and seven minutes long. \u2022Evaluations: Experienced members, chosen in advance, evaluate each of the prepared speeches. These evaluations are supportive; they describe what the speaker did well and how the speaker could improve. Evaluations are two to three minutes long.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Self-evaluations: Each prepared speaker gets a minute to tell us how she or he felt while preparing and delivering the speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Time-keeper has been timing every speaker, and lists how long each of us spoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The Um-counter tells us how many times each of us used filler words such as \"um,\" \"uh,\" \"you know,\" and \"like.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u25e6The General Meeting Evaluator reviews and gives us feedback about all aspects of the meeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Business meeting: The club President conducts a short business meeting. Club officers make reports and club policies are sometimes discussed. \u2022Voting: We vote for the best impromptu speech during Table Topics, the best prepared speech, and the best evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u2022Final Go-Around: We go around the room and each person briefly gives us feedback about the meeting.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11024723,"name":"Jeanne"},"members":166,"name":"Greenspeakers\/Toastmasters Public Speaking Club Meetup","id":18541743,"state":"NY","urlname":"Greenspeakers-Toastmasters-Public-Speaking-Club-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Parsippany","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1428698358000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"forextrading","name":"Forex Trading","id":8431},{"urlkey":"futures-trading","name":"Futures Trading","id":16268},{"urlkey":"currency-trading","name":"Currency Trading","id":16269},{"urlkey":"technical-analysis","name":"Technical Analysis","id":17232},{"urlkey":"stock-trading","name":"Stock Trading","id":17234},{"urlkey":"equities-trading","name":"Equities Trading","id":19268},{"urlkey":"stocks-and-options","name":"Stocks and Options","id":19809},{"urlkey":"stock-investing","name":"Stock Investing","id":22016},{"urlkey":"options-trading","name":"Options Trading","id":24425},{"urlkey":"stock-market-trading","name":"Stock market trading","id":24472},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Trading-and-Investing-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Traders and investors of all experience and skill levels who are actively involved in stocks, options, futures, commodities, currencies or other major financial markets.
