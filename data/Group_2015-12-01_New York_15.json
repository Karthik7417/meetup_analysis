We can also raise awareness for the sport in the local area and help fuel its rising growth in the US.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":195932068,"name":"Andrew","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/c\/7\/highres_251606567.jpeg","photo_id":251606567,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/c\/7\/member_251606567.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/c\/7\/thumb_251606567.jpeg"}},"members":6,"name":"NYC Clay Dusters","id":19145758,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Clay-Dusters","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Clay Dusters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448236877000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"toastmasters","name":"Toastmasters","id":3307},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"impromptu-speaking","name":"Impromptu Speaking","id":115794}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wall-Street-Toastmasters\/","rating":0,"description":"Wall Street Toastmasters brings together people from varied backgrounds with the desire of enhancing our public speaking skills in an encouraging environment.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","members":1,"name":"Wall Street Toastmasters","id":19146020,"state":"NY","urlname":"Wall-Street-Toastmasters","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Wall Street Toastmasters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Edison","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448237544000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"praise-and-worship","name":"Praise and Worship","id":15722},{"urlkey":"prayer","name":"Prayer","id":16040},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"god","name":"God","id":20588},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589},{"urlkey":"faith","name":"Faith","id":25051},{"urlkey":"church","name":"Church","id":26229},{"urlkey":"bible","name":"Bible","id":40388}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GodChasers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A God Chaser is a person whose passion for God's presence presses him to chase the impossible in hopes in the uncatchable might catch him.

This group is also good for people new to the city that are interested in meeting great people. I have some FREE, fun, simple and creative ideas for this group, but I want to wait to see how many members it gets before starting meetups. So<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;1.

What if you could upgrade your thoughts, feelings,habits and future like the apps on your tablet or smartphone? Are you stuck and can't get your life moving faster. What if there are NEW methods to RESET your life like when your smartphone freezes. \"UPGRADE And RESET YOUR LIFE\" provides tools that will make you happier, more passionate about life, more productive on your dreams, and wealthier. We will get you to \"do life\" and not just learn \"about\" it. You will make discoveries about yourself, stop negative thoughts, develop better habits, evolve beyond your wildest dreams.

Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, take measurements of habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile. We will take abstract concepts and transform them through the knowledge of neural science and physics into powerful physical tools you can touch.

It becomes easy to literally see your limitations and problems while also seeing powerful solutions no other tools can provide. You will enhance the best of yourself while upgrading your life in ways beyond your dreams. Join this group to start UPGRADING YOUR LIFE each week. You will have fun while making real changes in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each Session members will hold in their hands printed sheets of Art work they will use to record parts of their minds, solve problems, communicate with their minds (different from meditation), record measurements of mental activity. With the Art Work members of the community will be able to show each others what they are working on each week. Personal improvement moves form a philosophical talk to show me your Art work and what you are working on. Members will select projects and goals they will work on as individuals and within the community making possible everything form habit change, weight release, less stress, greater mental focus, solving business problems, removing fears and anxieties, becoming free from shyness, emotional clarity and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>GAIN CLARITY ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IN YOUR BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LIFE<\/p>\n<p>MAKE REAL CHANGES TO YOUR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND ACTIONS<\/p>\n<p>DISCOVER THE HIDDEN ASSETS NEEDED TO BUILD YOUR FUTURE<\/p>\n<p>TRANSFORM YOUR PAST INTO AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF NEW POSSIBILITIES<\/p>\n<p>USE YOUR EMOTIONS AS RESOURCES<\/p>\n<p>YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW TO SET AND ACHIEVE GOALS IN THE REAL WORLD<\/p>\n<p>DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS<\/p>\n<p>EACH SESSION WILL BE WILL BUILD ON THE LAST AND TAKE TO THE NEXT STEP<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105794502,"name":"James Murdock","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/highres_149903682.jpeg","photo_id":149903682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/member_149903682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/thumb_149903682.jpeg"}},"members":36,"name":"UPGRADE AND RESET YOUR LIFE","id":19154726,"state":"NY","urlname":"UPGRADE-AND-RESET-YOUR-LIFE","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"BRAIN-MIND SETTERS"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Flushing","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448481823000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"tantric","name":"Tantra","id":10146},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"kirtan","name":"Kirtan","id":18868},{"urlkey":"devotional-singing","name":"Devotional Singing","id":21450},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-chanting","name":"Meditation and Chanting","id":82258},{"urlkey":"ananda-marga","name":"Ananda Marga","id":89311},{"urlkey":"vegetarians-and-vegans-vegan-vegetarian-activism","name":"Vegetarians and Vegans & Vegan Vegetarian Activism","id":136597}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Flushing-Ananda-Marga-Meditation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This Meetup provides a venue and scope to experience mantra chanting, learn and practice meditation, and other yogic practices of Ananda Marga.

Events are limited to 4 photographers. Most models seem to prefer 3 photographers. Those events with more than 4 are called paparazzi shoot-outs, they typically cost less. Some events are meet and greets or promotional events.<\/p>\n<p>The models chosen to be on the team have been interviewed and have passed a series of criteria to participate. These models are professional and work well beyond the time behind the camera: They scout locations, contact venues, determine if permits are required or not and obtain them if feasible. Some events require they rent wardrobe or equipment and it doesn't need to be explained that there is a great deal of time doing all of that. This group nor the models do any TFPs... Ever. What's nice is the photographers never have to spend any time editing, copying or distributing pictures to models. That's right. Photographers are not obligated to share their pictures nor are the models expecting any from them. WorldChoiceModels is ideal for:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers that want to do street photography or photowalks with a model. \u2022 Photographers looking to practice their skills, experiment with their equipment or technique.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers looking to expand their portfolios. bridal, senior portraits, couples, fashion, commercial lifestyle, editorial, etc. From time to time there will be workshops on studio lighting, and specific genres. So keep a look out. Hopefully changing the name will attract women photographers ,which I know are many.<\/p>\n<p>This is an excellent forum to practice and build your portfolio. In the next few months you will notice some admin activity and shortly after the models will take charge,<\/p>\n<p>My best to everyone<\/p>\n<p>John Bodensiek<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/7\/4\/highres_444545492.jpeg","photo_id":444545492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/7\/4\/600_444545492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/7\/4\/thumb_444545492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":161868152,"name":"WC-Sponsor-07","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/9\/7\/0\/highres_251706512.jpeg","photo_id":251706512,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/9\/7\/0\/member_251706512.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/9\/7\/0\/thumb_251706512.jpeg"}},"members":41,"name":"!! \"Brooklyn - New York - Model Events for Photographers\"","id":19158971,"state":"NY","urlname":"WorldChoiceModels-Brooklyn-NewYork","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448620049000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"networkmarket","name":"Network Marketing","id":2532},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"business-coaching","name":"Business Coaching","id":12669},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792},{"urlkey":"female-business-owners","name":"Female Business Owners","id":106507},{"urlkey":"female-business-networking","name":"Female Business Networking","id":458872}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Women-Networking-and-Socializing-30s-50s\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is for women in this great city who want to come together with other female entrepreneurs and become ambassadors for what we each are trying to accomplish.

Have been highly sensitive my whole life, sensing - seeing - hearing - knowing - things about others and my surroundings I had no way of knowing. For most of my life I absorbed other people's emotions and energies and could not distinguish them with my own. If people around me were angry, I would start feeling angry and didn't know why. If people around me were sad, I would feel sad and didn't know why. The same with joy - when people around me were joyful, I would feel full with joy. I would also absorb emotions of people I was close to, who lived at a distance. Or I would hear information about someone I knew, but discard it. By learning how to navigate this skill set and gifts -- and they are gifts once you learn to use them, and adding tools as well, separating what was me and where emotions came from became clear. Knowing my next right step became clear. Developing my Spirituality became paramount and added to the mix in a big blessing sort of way. I have been working with Empaths, as well as others, in my private Coaching Practice of 5 years. It's now time to start - EMPATH GROUP COACHING (in groups of 6 each) - by phone or skype. I'm kicking off my first group in January - there are some openings left. ----- If you'd like to join our Group in January (phone\/skype) -- here are the details: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/you-empath-corri-milner-cpc-mp-eli-2?trk=prof-post . Will be setting up Meetups in NYC every 1-2 Months, to help support there as well. Will look for a place to meet.

My name is Stacy. I grew up in a small town in New Jersey where everyone knew everybody. I dated and married one of my best friends cousins. We had a demolition business together, got married, had a kid. We were together for 15 years. Life presented us with many challenges and ultimately our marriage ended. I went down a spiritual path studying everything from transcendental meditation to Kabbalah. Which led me to move closer to the city. After getting divorced and uprooting my entire life, which included changing careers I found myself in search of like minded people. Thus this Meetup... I'm looking to create something to help those who are in a similar situation and to bring us all together and enjoy our new endeavors in life. I'd like to create social events with single parents and kids, adults only events, and just some good old fashion fun. If you're like me and you want to meet like minded people come try my Meetup and let me know what kinds of things you'll like to do. Xo Stacy P.S. My hot friend Esther who's also divorced but no kids is co-organizer of my new meetup.","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3048975,"name":"Esther Cervantes","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/a\/c\/highres_251290668.jpeg","photo_id":251290668,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/a\/c\/member_251290668.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/a\/c\/thumb_251290668.jpeg"}},"members":2,"name":"Jersey City Hot Fun Single Parent Meetup","id":19170235,"state":"NY","urlname":"Hotfunsingleparents","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Hot Fun Single Parents"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Orangeburg","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448941658000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"teachings-of-abraham-hicks","name":"Teachings of Abraham (Hicks)","id":19131},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"the-law-of-attraction-loa","name":"The Law of Attraction LOA","id":46309},{"urlkey":"eft-for-amplifying-the-law-of-attraction","name":"EFT for Amplifying The Law of Attraction","id":60169},{"urlkey":"law-of-attraction-positive-thinking","name":"Law of Attraction & Positive Thinking","id":61690},{"urlkey":"manifestation-the-law-of-attraction","name":"Manifestation & The Law of Attraction!","id":128301},{"urlkey":"law-of-attraction-universal-laws","name":"Law of Attraction & Universal Laws","id":159453}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Law-of-Attraction-Rockland-Bergen-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"\"We are what we think.

At AIESEC Youth Action Summit, we will take a deeper look into the state of the world and the impact of the Millennium Development Goals, to be able to grasp the potential of the Sustainable Development Goals. We will define the role each stakeholder plays in it, especially young people and will generate actionable ideas to be implemented after the summit. The event will act as a platform, connecting different sectors to come together and co-create actions. AIESEC Youth Action Summit is a place where new and actionable ideas will be born to be implemented to impact the world and its future.

The music can range from R and B, Pop, Rock and Roll, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Reggae, Calypso, Soca, Merengue, Afro-Cuban, Reggaeton and anything else in between. Some events are local in New York City and New Jersey with dinner while others are day trip events with buses commuting from the five boroughs to dinner halls then concerts halls. Some live artist who participate are well known and others are up and coming. Some are events with 70's, 80's or 90's themes while others presenting the current styles of music. Some are live shows with artist and other are dancing events. These are usually free or low cost events that are sponsored by The Making A Difference with Morinda Organization which focuses on charity, health and fitness. So some events may include a short sponsorship presentation or venue advertisement of maintaining and living in better health from a sponsor representative for 30 minutes prior to a show.

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. In 2014 BNI members passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business. Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 20+ (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 20+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Tuesdays at 7:00AM at Junior's) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?! Current Location: Junior's 386 Flatbush Ave Ext Brooklyn, NY 11201 Cost: $20\/visitor The meeting starts at 7:00am and is officially over at 8:30am. You will need to bring 50+ business cards to pass to everyone in the room. You will also need to be prepared to tell the room who you are, what you do, and who a perfect referral for you would be. The more specific you are in asking for the referral the greater chance you have in receiving that life changing referral on the spot.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196314630,"name":"Revenue Raisers","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/highres_251811307.jpeg","photo_id":251811307,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/member_251811307.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/8\/6\/b\/thumb_251811307.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"BNI Revenue Raisers, Brooklyn NY","id":19173196,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Revenue-Raisers-Brooklyn-NY","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449019036000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"landlords","name":"Landlords","id":484},{"urlkey":"apthunt","name":"Apartment Hunting","id":9525},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"landlords-gains-without-the-headaches","name":"Landlords gains without the headaches","id":19048},{"urlkey":"renters-and-landlords","name":"Renters and Landlords","id":21389},{"urlkey":"apartments","name":"Apartments","id":31380},{"urlkey":"residential-income-property-owners","name":"Residential Income Property Owners","id":60994},{"urlkey":"managing-tenants","name":"Managing Tenants","id":67451},{"urlkey":"rental-investing","name":"Rental Investing","id":75849},{"urlkey":"making-money-with-rental-property","name":"Making Money with Rental Property","id":75850},{"urlkey":"rental-property-investments","name":"Rental Property Investments","id":97067},{"urlkey":"landlord-and-property-managers","name":"Landlord and Property Managers","id":143826},{"urlkey":"landlord-networking","name":"Landlord Networking","id":816702},{"urlkey":"tenants","name":"Tenants","id":1412782}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Heavenly-Tenant\/","rating":0,"description":"This group is inspired by the growing number of individuals who have been provided with government grants to assist with their transition into stable housing.
