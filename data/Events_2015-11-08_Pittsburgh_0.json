Her Guardian, the Lord Chancellor of the House of Lords, refuses to permit it, for he wishes for her to marry a Peer of the House.<\/p> <p>But this tale is just beginning\u2026 for the shepherd boy is Strephon, half fairy\/half mortal son of the Fairy Iolanthe, a friend of the Fairy Queen.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s NOT a good idea to anger the Fairy Queen! Fairies and Shepherds, Politicians and Soldiers, and a musical Masterpiece that delights one and all!<\/p> <p>Iolanthe is a fairy who married a human, and bore a son. That's bad. When caught, she was banished and family abandoned. As the opera opens, she is pardoned. Her son, Strephon, plans to marry Phyllis, a ward of the Lord High Chancellor of England (who cares for orphans as part of his official duties). Problem: Everyone in the House of Lords has fallen in love with Phyllis. Permission to marry her is denied, so Strephon calls on the fairies for help. They get him into Parliament, and ensure that any act he supports passes. The Lords are thrown into disarray by this short-circuit of power politics, and by competition over Phyllis. Finally the Chancellor decides to marry her himself. Iolanthe reveals herself as the Chancellor's long-lost wife, and is condemned to death again. How can Iolanthe's execution be stopped? How can Strephon and Phyllis get back together? How can the Lords be rid of the pestiferous Strephon and his infallible legislation?

This modern-day revival boasts an amazing cast of actors bringing life to a comedy classic that inspired two films. Don't miss the hilarity from the prolific master George S. Kaufman behind such classics\u00a0as\u00a0<i>\"You Can't Take It With You\"<\/i>, <i>\"The Man Who Came to Dinner\"<\/i>, several Marx brothers gems including <i>\"Animal Crackers\"<\/i> and <i>\"A Night at the Opera<\/i>\", and so much more.<\/p> <p>Don't miss this wonderful new\u00a0production of <b><i>\"Dulcy\"<\/i><\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Check out these great articles and reviews\u00a0about the show <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/24\/Stage-preview-Screwball-comedy-Dulcy-unleashed-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509240023<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.pghcitypaper.com\/pittsburgh\/dulcy-at-pittsburgh-playwrights\/Content?oid=1857116<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/ae\/theater-dance\/2015\/09\/29\/Stage-review-A-1920s-Kaufman-Connelly-farce-gets-an-update-at-Pittsburgh-Playwrights\/stories\/201509290019<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Of note is that it has\u00a0been 10 years since Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company's successful production of George S.

Verdi\u00a0commented that \"this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that <i>Nabucco<\/i> was born under a lucky star\".<\/p> <p>This opera follows the plight of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jews\">Jews<\/a> as they are assaulted, conquered and subsequently\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylonian_captivity\">exiled<\/a>\u00a0from their homeland by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylon\">Babylonian<\/a> King Nabucco (in English, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebuchadnezzar_II\">Nebuchadnezzar II<\/a>). The\u00a0opera is set\u00a0in 587 BC where\u00a0historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a><\/i> \/ \"Fly, thought, on golden wings\", a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today.<\/p> <p>What makes \"Nabucco\" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you'll get when Mark Delavan (who's sung previously\u00a0here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff, Rigoletto, and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who\u00a0takes both his daughters to war with him -- one daughter, gentle Fenena, is captured by the Hebrews, only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele, <i>nephew of the King of Jerusalem)<\/i>\u00a0while the other daughter, Abigaille, is consumed by ambition, frustration (she wants Ismaele), and rage against anything in her way, including her father. \u00a0The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big, traditional production.

The classes are usually 50\/50 men and women. Lots of couples - couples, friends, sisters - attend. The class is donation-based. $5 donation is suggested.<\/p> <p>All classes are from 7:00 \u2013 8:00 pm.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beginners are welcome.<\/p> <p>$5 donation suggested.<\/p> <p>Loaner mats available.<\/p> <p>Visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dormontyoga<\/a><\/a> for more info.

Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Facility Information:<\/b>\u00a0Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What's included in the price?<\/b>\u00a0Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Questions?<\/b>\u00a0Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Members are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration. If you expect to be late more than 15 minutes, please send a text message to the posted organizer's phone number.<\/p> <p>4. We will practice and always play a game - doubles or singles, depending on the number of members who come to the event.<\/p> <p>5. The organizer will try to pair the teams based on skill levels but this may not always be possible and the pairing may be on a first-come-first-serve basis.<\/p> <p>6.

Verdi\u00a0commented that \"this is the opera with which my artistic career really begins. And though I had many difficulties to fight against, it is certain that <i>Nabucco<\/i> was born under a lucky star\".<\/p> <p>This opera follows the plight of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jews\">Jews<\/a> as they are assaulted, conquered and subsequently <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylonian_captivity\">exiled<\/a> from their homeland by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Babylon\">Babylonian<\/a> King Nabucco (in English, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebuchadnezzar_II\">Nebuchadnezzar II<\/a>). The\u00a0opera is set in 587 BC where\u00a0historical events are used as background for a romantic and political plot. The best-known number from the opera is the \"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\", <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Va,_pensiero\">Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate<\/a><\/i> \/ \"Fly, thought, on golden wings\", a chorus which is regularly given an encore in many opera houses when performed today.<\/p> <p>What makes \"Nabucco\" LARGER THAN LIFE? The chills you'll get when Mark Delavan (who's sung previously\u00a0here in Pittsburgh as Falstaff, Rigoletto, and Scarpia) portrays the troubled monarch who\u00a0takes both his daughters to war with him -- one daughter, gentle Fenena, is captured by the Hebrews, only to be freed by her Hebrew lover (Ismaele, <i>nephew of the King of Jerusalem)<\/i>\u00a0while the other daughter, Abigaille, is consumed by ambition, frustration (she wants Ismaele), and rage against anything in her way, including her father. \u00a0The epic story of the Jews in exile in Babylon. The impressive and affecting projections that accompany this big, traditional production.

Yet the future of this industry is the subject of a highly charged debate being aired on the streets, in the press and at City Hall. Carriage operators say that horse-drawn carriages should stay because they are a cherished symbol of New York City that bring in tourist dollars. Animal rights activists say the industry should be banned because it\u2019s inhumane and unsafe. They believe Hollywood has romanticized horse-drawn carriages and claim that life on congested city streets is anything but romantic for nervous, prey animals.<\/p> <p>As a result of three fatal accidents since 2006 and a bill introduced at City Hall to ban horse-drawn carriages from NYC, the plight of the NYC carriage horses is now in the public eye more than ever before. But the public doesn\u2019t know much more than what they see on the streets and in the news.<\/p> <p>Through original footage taken with hidden cameras and interviews with carriage drivers, veterinarians, accident witnesses, animal rights activists, politicians, tourists, residents who live near the horses and people who have rescued NYC carriage horses from slaughter, BLINDERS takes viewers behind the scenes to expose the truth behind the tradition<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-vegans\/events\/225443315\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Vegan Book Club... film edition!

Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir.<\/p> <p>The Andrew Alden Ensemble is a contemporary and electronic chamber music group from Rochester, NY. Their goal is to bring forth new music for chamber music and film. The ensemble produces textual scores for film and performs them in front of a live audience to transform the picture with new sounds and experiences.<\/p> <p>The Andrew Alden Ensemble brings together a fascinating collaboration of rock music and contemporary classical composition including percussion, synthesizer, piano, violin, cello and electronic production. Their music combines the influence of Steve Reich, Philip Glass, David Lang, Radiohead, Velvet Underground and Krzysvtof Penderecki to create beautiful and haunting landscapes.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehollywooddormont.org\/calendar\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.thehollywooddormont.org\/calendar\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/225543087\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari w\/ live music @ Hollywood Theatre","id":"225543087","time":1445194800000,"updated":1445209369000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.422.9650","address_1":"5801 Forbes Avenue","name":"Carnegie Library Squirrel Hill","lon":-79.922536,"id":882044,"state":"PA","lat":40.438137,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.63796234131,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437954103000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be working through lesson 8 in the book. \"Japanese for Busy People\" book 2 version 3. \u00a0 As usual, we'll meet in Classroom C.<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's try to figure out how we can improve upon what we are learning so that we can make it both more interactive and at the same time begin to really use our language skills. \u00a0Do we want to try having more quizzes? \u00a0Interactive dialog? \u00a0Roleplaying?<\/p> <p>Last week we left off at the end of Lesson 7, and decided to study the Lesson 7 Kanji, as well as the first three pages of the Lesson 7 workbook exercises.\u00a0 After we review those, we will pick up with Lesson 8.<\/p> <p>If anyone has any ideas for other things they'd like to try let me know.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We are in Classroom C not far from the elevator.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JSGPITT\/events\/226007789\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Japanese Study Group level 1 Intermediate","id":"jfqmjlytnbxb","time":1445194800000,"updated":1445200760000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1297574466000,"name":"Japanese Language Study Group","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":1782914,"urlname":"JSGPITT","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Japanese speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15206","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412.901.4298","address_1":"6617 Hamilton Ave","name":"Absolute Ballroom Dancing","lon":-79.909891,"id":1120340,"state":"PA","lat":40.457782,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.27536725998,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443018293000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>USA Sunday Dance held at different studio every month.

His first book, The First Modern Jew: Spinoza and the History of an Image, traces the shifting image of the seventeenth-century Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza in modern Jewish culture. It was co-winner of the 2012 American Academy for Jewish Research's Salo Wittmayer Baron Prize, and a finalist for the 2012 National Jewish Book Award in History. Professor Schwartz is currently working on a new research project, a genealogy of the ghetto that traces its evolution as a word, concept, metaphor, and place in both Jewish history and beyond Jewish contexts as such. His research interests include Jewish historical consciousness, early modern and modern Jewish identities, and Jewish intellectuals.<\/p> <p>The term ghetto is among the most fraught and freighted in the vocabulary of Jewish culture and history. Indeed, it has not only featured prominently in virtually all the major developments of modern Jewish history, from emancipation to antisemitism, from urbanization to suburbanization, and from mass migration to mass murder. The \u201cghetto\u201d has been fundamental to the very definition and constitution of Jewish modernity. For all this explosion of \u201cghetto-talk,\u201d the term has arguably become central to the collective history and identity of only one other people beyond Jews, namely African Americans. Ultimately, the story of the term\u2019s migration from Jewish to black concerns more than simply the changing nuance of a particular word. The transference of the ghetto was a semantic as much as a socioeconomic historical development, and indeed was understood as such.<\/p> <p>For more information contact: [masked] The event is sponsored by Jewish Studies and co-sponsored by the Department of Religious Studies, Department of History, Carnegie-Mellon Department of History, and the Humanities Center.<\/p> <p>Location and Address<br\/>Humanities Center<\/p> <p>602 Cathedral of Learning<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/226101780\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Pitt Lecture: From Jewish to Black: the Strange Career of the Word Ghetto","id":"226101780","time":1445286600000,"updated":1445299050000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15222","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"655 Penn Avenue","name":"Cabaret At Theater Square","lon":-80.001007,"id":6434262,"state":"PA","lat":40.443089,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.27014493942,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442878019000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/d\/7\/3\/600_442279827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Please join us on October 19 as we continue our happy hour series downtown in the Cultural District.

Product Description<br\/>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<\/p> <p>When we deny our stories, they define us.<br\/>When we own our stories, we get to write the ending. Social scientist Bren\u00e9 Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability\u2014the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome\u2014is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people\u2014from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents\u2014shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they\u2019re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we\u2019re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It\u2019s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.<br\/>Product Description<br\/>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<\/p> <p>When we deny our stories, they define us.<br\/>When we own our stories, we get to write the ending.

From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Girl-Train-Novel-Paula-Hawkins-ebook\/dp\/B00L9B7IKE\/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Amazon.com<\/a>:<\/p> <p><br\/>Intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won\u2019t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins\u2019s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn\u2019t help but think:\u00a0<i>Hitchcockian<\/i>. From the opening line, the reader knows what they\u2019re in for: \u201cShe\u2019s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks\u2026\u201d But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran\u2019s finesse. The \u201cgirl on the train\u201d is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees \u201cJess\u201d kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character\u2019s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s wife, who happens to be Jess\/Megan\u2019s neighbor. Rachel\u2019s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess\/Megan\u2019s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn\u2019t. This is a book to be devoured.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>-Neal Thompson<\/i><\/p> <p>Please ask at the host stand for the book club.

We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play.

We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group.

Taking tea at the scene of a multiple poisoning, with a suspected murderess as one's host, is a perilous business. For a start, the talk tends to turn to arsenic. \"It happened in this very room, and we still have our dinner in here every night,\" explains Uncle Julian, continually rehearsing the details of the fatal family meal. \"My sister made these this morning,\" says Merricat, politely proffering a plate of rum cakes, fresh from the poisoner's kitchen. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is full of a macabre and sinister humor, and Merricat herself, its amiable narrator, is one of the great unhinged heroines of literature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Merricat has developed an idiosyncratic system of rules and protective magic, burying talismanic objects beneath the family estate, nailing them to trees, ritually revisiting them. But when a\u00a0stranger arrives, he disturbs the sisters' careful habits, installing himself at the head of the family table, unearthing Merricat's treasures. Unable to drive him away by either polite or occult means, Merricat adopts more desperate methods.<\/p> <p>Jackson's novel emerges less as a study in eccentricity and more as a powerful critique of the anxious, ruthless processes involved in the maintenance of normality itself. \"Poor strangers,\" says Merricat contentedly at last, studying trespassers from the darkness behind the barricaded Blackwood windows. \"They have so much to be afraid of.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Feel free to read more at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle\">Goodreads<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Approx.

In fact, the happier and more balanced you are, the more profoundly contributing you will be to this planet and everything living on it. On a spirit level, if every one of us decides to take better care of ourselves, if we decide to bring ourselves into balance, we can create a much improved future for ourselves, our children and our planet. But balance is sometimes easier to talk about, and long for than it is to attain. In our misguided efforts to achieve this desired balanced state, we often feel the solution is to become more active, to simply do more, to make more commitments in our already over-committed lives. This is the right approach; it sets us up for certain failure. Action for action\u2019s sake often leads to a life of increased imbalance.

This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist\u2019s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties, out of college, and hoping to live as a writer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alongside his professional ambitions, the film charts his romantic awakening, which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events, and his eventual, fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and demonstrating Ray\u2019s ever-more-impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, Apur Sansar is a breathtaking conclusion to this monumental trilogy.

Nobody could have predicted the cultural, psychological, and illuminating impact EIT! would have on our consciousness, but seeing all their greatest works chronicled in one place reminds us that in the right hands, garbage can be turned into gold! It is time pack up your copies of Jerry Maguire and accept the fact that your life up until this moment has been pointless.

If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Requirements to play:<\/b>\u00a0This is an adult volleyball group.

Shortly after getting back to town, Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan.<\/p> <p>Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she\u2019s ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan?<\/p> <p>In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly, these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah, as well as the people around her.

The reasons were two fold. First, to me an image has no meaning if it is only seen on a phone, tablet or computer screen. Photos are meant to be hung on a wall and admired properly. Second, there is hardly any better feeling for a photographer than to have his\/her work hung in a gallery. last year that attempt fell through (I blame the Post Office). This year it is coming together. Pamela Russell has offered her Gallery space for this show. This is what I need from the members: I want you to email me two of your best images, a first choice and a second choice. Send it to [masked]. The file should be no larger than 5x7 but at 300dpi. The gallery has space for about 50-75 images. If every member sends in an image then I will have to edit some but if fewer members send in images then you may get both images in.<br\/>Conditions for the show: There are no limitations on subject matter. This is a Fine Art group so nudes are acceptable. B&amp;W or Color is fine. The only limitations are on frame size. All images MUST be mounted, matted and framed. Frame size is not to exceed 16x20.

Russell,\u00a0JD, CG, CGL<br\/>Somebody had to pay the government's bills, and they did it through the law by imposing taxes on polls, personal\u00a0property, and real property. The records of those taxes offer some of the best clues available to our ancestors, their\u00a0families, and their neighborhoods.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Don't Forget the Ladies: \u00a0A Genealogist's Guide to Women and the Law<\/b><br\/>Presented by Judy G. Russell,\u00a0JD, CG, CGL<br\/>In early America, women were all too often the people who just weren't there: not in the records, not in the censuses, not on juries, not in the voting booth. The common law relegated women to \u201cprotected\u201d\u2013second-class\u2013status and understanding how they were treated under the law provides clues to finding their identities today.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Where There Is-or Isn't-a Will<\/b><br\/>Presented by Judy G. Russell,\u00a0JD, CG, CGL<br\/>Where there's a will, there's a probate. And often when there isn't a will, there's still a probate.\u00a0Understanding the process and finding the records created when our ancestors died can help break through those brick walls.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>No Vitals? No Problem!\u00a0 Building a Family through Circumstantial Evidence<\/b><br\/>Presented by Judy G. Russell,\u00a0JD, CG, CGL<br\/>When there's no birth, marriage, or death record, what's a genealogist to do? Learn how to use\u00a0circumstantial evidence to build a family.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Using Old Documents in Your Research<\/b><br\/>Presented by Michael J. Leclerc<br\/>Electronic databases and online trees are great places for clues, but the only way to be certain that the people in your database are actually your ancestors is to research in the\u00a0 original records. These are getting more and more accessible in the digital age. Learn the steps necessary to not only read these documents, but also to understand their meaning.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Telling Your Family\u2019s Story with Mocavo and\u00a0Findmypast<\/b><br\/>Presented by Michael J.

This is for accidental or intentional blur.<\/p> <p>Accidental blur might be the result of camera shake or even an accidental snap. The result may look terrible, but in some instances may create an interesting effect.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Intentional blur might achieve an impressionistic ambience.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are many kinds of blur: lens blur, motion blur, panning\/zooming blur, filter blur (Vaseline, hairspray, stockings, cling wrap, etc.), each lending its own look and characteristics. \u00a0You can also create blur though enhancement software.<\/p> <p>Blur offers many opportunities for producing extraordinary images and which blur to use will depend on your own preferences. Apart from strictly aesthetic reasons, consider what kind of mood each technique lends the image with regard to the chosen subject and a message that you want to communicate.<\/p> <p>For example, blur patterns produced by panning support the illusion of motion as well as recording time in a single frame. Lens blur will suggest ambiguity and mystery. Hairspray may add a romantic feel to a photograph.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look at the subject matter, lighting, colors, shapes, and textures, and decide upon the emotions you wish to convey in your image. Blur can be an effective way of achieving this.<\/p> <p>Note the winner of the December contest will judge the February Contest instead of January's which will be judged by member's votes.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

Contact MONDO ITALIANO at [masked]\/Tel:[masked]<\/p> <p>The documentary and the Capodarco project will be presented by Film Director Luca Guardabascio.<\/p> <p>Father Franco Monterubbianesi is the Founder of the Capodarco Community, a non-profit organization working since 1966 to promote and defend the dignity of marginalized people, especially those wtih mental and physical disability. The organization promotes their social and employment integration.<br\/>Since 1966 when he was a young priest, Father Franco was inspired by a strong belief that he made his only one mission: we should not accept injustice. In a globalized world based on economic power and competitiveness, marginalized people are victims of social and cultural exclusion. Father Franco, now 83 years old, has spent all his life promoting the affirmation of human, social and cultural rights of people with disabilities.<br\/>Today the young generations are the new marginalized people. Capodarco has deeply marked the Italian Welfare State promoting important National Legislation such as on school integration of disabled students or in more recent years on social agriculture. The Italian Law knows as Legge Basaglia that abolished Mental Hospitals was also inspired by the Capodarco example.<br\/>\"Capodarco: prima del futuro\" (Capodarco: Before the Future) is a documentary about the Capodarco Project. Directed by Luca Guardabascio, the film involves Capodarco residents and their realities which represent the main aspect of Capodarco's ideas not only of the past and of the present, but also of the future.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/1\/f\/600_443544095.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers\/events\/226347607\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Screening of \"Capodarco e i giovani\" Before the Future\" (by Luca Guardabascio)","id":"226347607","time":1446681600000,"updated":1446693952000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1047114201000,"name":"MONDO ITALIANO: Pittsburgh Italian Meetup","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":85432,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Italian Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","phone":"412-422-8888","address_1":"2000 Murray Ave","name":"Te Cafe","lon":-79.92284,"id":370414,"state":"PA","lat":40.43475,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":2.82900071144,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445481095000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-East-End-Knitting-Meetup\/events\/226275192\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Lets craft and drink tea together","id":"cfzqllytpbgb","time":1446681600000,"updated":1446726649000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445007966000,"name":"Pittsburgh East End Knitting Meetup","group_lon":-79.9199981689,"id":19033002,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-East-End-Knitting-Meetup","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Knitters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"3420 Babcock Blvd","name":"Ideal Wellness and Weight Loss","lon":-80.023682,"id":24147086,"state":"PA","lat":40.539188,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.16389465332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444673828000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Wellness-and-Weight-Loss-with-Ideal-Protein\/events\/226010256\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Carbs, Fats, and Proteins","id":"226010256","time":1446683400000,"updated":1446688045000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444672765000,"name":"Pittsburgh Wellness and Weight Loss with Ideal Protein","group_lon":-80.0400009155,"id":19020568,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Wellness-and-Weight-Loss-with-Ideal-Protein","group_lat":40.5499992371,"who":"Healthy Eaters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"242 51st St","name":"Spirit","lon":-79.95662,"id":23973281,"lat":40.47881,"repinned":true},"headcount":5,"distance":0.702557384968,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446613239000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is last minute event I found through facebook, but hopefully anyone interested and available will be able to make it.

Biophilia argues that we have co-evolved with nature and that we have a deep need to affiliate with the natural world. \u00a0But how can that connection to nature happen in in an increasingly urbanized world? And what are the other ways that cities can co-exist with, nurture and care for nature, both local and global? Timothy Beatley will argue that we need to shift towards a vision of\u00a0biophilic cities\u00a0and will describe some of the things that emerging leaders and partner cities are doing in this arena.<\/p> <p>Timothy Beatley has taught in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning, School of Architecture at the University of Virginia for the last 28 years. He is the author or co-author of more than fifteen books on these subjects, including\u00a0Green Urbanism: Learning from European Cities\u00a0(recently translated into Chinese),\u00a0Native to Nowhere: Sustaining Home and Community in a Global Age, andBiophilic Cities: Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning.

To help Pennsylvanians navigate these complex decisions, 90.5 WESA joins NPR to bring NPR Presents: Family Matters to Pittsburgh for a candid conversation about personal finance at Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum on November 5 at 7:00 PM. Tickets for the free event are available here.<\/p> <p><br\/>David Greene, host of NPR's Morning Edition<br\/>CREDIT DAVID GILKEY<br\/>In collaboration with NPR Member stations, NPR Presents: Family Matters is a live national events series that connects regular people with financial experts for invaluable conversations around money. Led by NPR Morning Edition host David Greene and Business correspondents Yuki Noguchi and Sonari Glinton, these live (and lively) events are driven by an audience ready to talk strategy: from accumulating debt and amassing wealth; to saving for college, home ownership, retirement and even fitting in a midlife extravagance, or two.<\/p> <p>In Pittsburgh, Greene and Noguchi will be joined on stage by personal finance experts Louis Barajas, founder and chief wealth and business manager at LAB Financial Life Solutions, and Saundra Davis, a U.S. Navy Veteran and financial coach who works alongside community-based organizations that empower low income Americans with tools to build and grow assets. Together they will leave audience members with greater confidence in their financial futures.<\/p> <p>The public can follow and participate in these conversations with #NPRFamilyMatters.<\/p> <p><br\/>NPR Business Reporter Yuki Noguchi<br\/>Through reporting projects that have taken them to the living rooms, banks and offices where people are making big decisions about money, Greene and Noguchi each have unique perspectives on the specific pressures families face today. Greene has been hosting Family Matters events in communities across the country since 2013. In the Morning Edition series \u2018Family Matters: The Money Squeeze\u2019, he joined three families to explore the financial challenges of the \"sandwich generation\u201d \u2013 those balancing elder-care costs, college-bound kids and post-employment retirement plans. Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues \u2013 from abusive working environments, to idiosyncratic cubicle culture \u2013 and national stories that strongly affect working Americans, such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes. NPR Presents: Family Matters is made possible by TIAA-CREF, which \u2014for nearly 100 years\u2014has helped millions of Americans pursue their financial dreams, and by a collaboration between NPR and NPR Member station 90.5 WESA, in Pittsburgh, P.A.<\/p> <p>ABOUT NPR<\/p> <p>NPR is the leading provider of non-commercial news and entertainment programming in the U.S. More than 27 million people listen to NPR programs each week via 800+ public radio stations throughout the country. In partnership with Member stations, NPR strives to create a more informed public \u2013 one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures. As a digital innovator and a leader in the public media community, NPR assures that the unique mission of nonprofit public media is not only preserved, but grows.<\/p> <p>About 90.5 WESA<\/p> <p>90.5 WESA, Pittsburgh\u2019s NPR news station, is a local, wholly-owned subsidiary of independent public radio station 91.3 WYEP \/Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corp. 90.5 WESA can be heard on 90.5 FM in Pittsburgh; 92.3 FM in New Baltimore; 100.5 FM in Johnstown, 104.1 FM in Ligonier and Somerset, and online at wesa.fm.<\/p> <p>About The Panelists<\/p> <p>David Greene -- Co-Host, Morning Edition<\/p> <p>@NPRGreene<\/p> <p>David Greene co-hosts NPR\u2019s #1 newsmagazine Morning Edition alongside Renee Montagne and Steve Inskeep. David has interviewed everyone from presidents to pop stars, but he believes that everyone, whether famous or not, has a compelling story to tell \u2013 it just takes listening. David has brought home human interest stories from places like North Dakota, as Americans grapple with the issue of same-sex marriage, and Crimea, where uneasiness around geopolitical unrest and national identity is perennial and complex. Prior to stepping into the host chair, David spent two years abroad as an NPR international correspondent based in Moscow. During the Arab Spring, David spent a month reporting from Libya as NATO bombs fell on Tripoli, for which he was honored with the Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize.<\/p> <p>David also spent four years covering the G.W. Bush administration; a position that led him to five continents, to NPR\u2019s \u201cspacious\u201d booth in the basement of the West Wing and aboard Air Force One, as President Bush first surveyed the devastation from Hurricane Katrina and afterward met with affected New Orleans residents. David reported deeply on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and, after President Obama took office, spent three months driving across America documenting how the recession was affecting the lives of regular Americans.<\/p> <p>David was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun for nearly seven years before he joined NPR in 2005. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a degree in government.<\/p> <p>Yuki Noguchi -- NPR Business Desk Correspondent in Washington, D.C.<\/p> <p>@YukiNoguchi<\/p> <p>As NPR Business correspondent, Yuki Noguchi regularly reports on workplace issues \u2013 from abusive working environments, to idiosyncratic cubicle culture \u2013 and national stories that strongly affect working Americans, such as the housing market meltdown and wage disputes.<\/p> <p>Following Reddit CEO Ellen Pao\u2019s lawsuit alleging gender discrimination by Pao\u2019s former Silicon Valley employer, Yuki reported on how startups are using tech to fight workplace bias. She\u2019s similarly synthesized other evolving workplace dynamics, such as Zappos\u2019 \u201cholocratic\u201d employee structure, Amazon\u2019s inclusion of peer reviews in staff evaluations and a 2015 federal law requiring public companies to disclose ratios comparing their CEO\u2019s compensation to their workers\u2019 median pay.<\/p> <p>Since joining NPR in 2008, Noguchi has reported deeply on business and economic news and in recent years has covered the housing market meltdown, unemployment during the Great Recession, and the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan. Her coverage interests are wide-ranging, and have included things like entomophagy and the St. Louis Cardinals.<\/p> <p>Yuki began her career in journalism at the Washington Post, where she reported on business and technology and later became an editor.<\/p> <p>Yuki lives with her family in the Washington, D.C. area. She has a degree in history from Yale.<\/p> <p><br\/>Luis Barajas<br\/>Louis Barajas defies the traditional concept of financial and business expert. Louis connects with people through their hearts, their dreams, and the often-difficult realities of their lives. He\u2019s not just about numbers. Rather than fixating on the size of the client\u2019s bank balance, investment portfolio, or retirement account, his approach has always been to show people how to use their resources to live better lives today, tomorrow, and in the future. His humanity-based financial and business advice works well for people making $25,000, $250,000, or Millions, because most everyone has a deep desire to want to make a difference in their lives.<\/p> <p>Louis is the author of 5 books: Small Business Big Life for Women \u2013 7 Secrets for Designing A Business to Help You Live Your Best Life; My Street Money \u2013 A Street-Level View of Managing Your Money From the Heart to the Bank; The Latino Journey to Financial Greatness \u2013 10 Steps to Creating Wealth and Happiness for You and Your Family; Small Business \u2013 Big Life; and Overworked Overwhelmed and Underpaid.<\/p> <p>Louis is one of the first Latinos in the United States to receive the Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae) designation. He was named as one of the Top 100 Financial Advisors by Mutual Funds Magazine. Money Magazine also named Louis as one of America\u2019s Top Advisors. He was also chosen by People en Espa\u00f1ol as a person making a difference in the lives of Americans.<\/p> <p>Louis has been featured in regional and national publications such as USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, People en Espa\u00f1ol, Hispanic Business, and Senior Market Advisor. He has provided his financial and business insights to national news programs such as CBS Sunday Morning, CNN\u2019s Your Money, CNBC, The Willis Report on Fox Business News, Aqui Y Ahora on Univision, ABC News, and National Public Radio\u2019s Tell Me More.<\/p> <p><br\/>Saundra Davis<br\/>Saundra Davis is a US Navy veteran, financial coach, educator, and consultant who is nationally recognized as an expert in the financial coaching field and for her work with community-based organizations that focus on asset building for the working poor. Ms. Davis is the founder and Executive Director of Sage Financial Solutions, a San Francisco-based organization that develops comprehensive financial capability programs for low- and moderate-income communities in California and throughout the United States. Her innovative approach to financial capability was recognized in 2008 when she was selected as an Echoing Green semifinalist and, most recently, via special invitation to attend President Obama\u2019s 2014 White House Summit5o Working Families.<\/p> <p>Ms. Davis holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Management and a Master\u2019s degree in Financial Planning from Golden Gate University where she is currently an adjunct professor in the Personal Financial Planning program.

We are also working with several game developers and offering them free space in our dealers' room (see below) to highlight their games.<\/p> <p>There is also a mix of Role-playing games running throughout the weekend. There are both independent publisher games, as well as your favorite D&amp;D and Star Wars RPGs. The RPGA will also be running Living FR all weekend long, with first-run events for the living campaign.<\/p> <p>Your favorite CCG's will also get some play, with several Magic events being held throughout the weekend.<\/p> <p>We had an explosion of miniature event submissions this year, so there are many other events scheduled throughout the weekend, including Frag-A-Rama, You Sunk my Battleship (AA War at Sea), Bolt Action, Sails of Glory, X-Wing, and more. GASPcon will see the return of the outstanding Classic BattleTech Poker Run on Saturday, where the object is to collect poker cards by killing your opponents, and the winner is the player with the best hand.<\/p> <p>Sunday is the featured Signature Miniatures Event, which this year will be a version of Battletech: Alpha Strike using the Robotech Tactics miniatures. 10 players will battle on and over Macross Island, as the Zentradi and UDF struggle for control of the precious Protoculture!<\/p> <p>For our Star Wars fans we have 3 Imperial Assault events and 2 X-Wing events. Both X-Wing events will have prize support, as well as at least one of the Imperial Assault events.<\/p> <p>Note \u2013 We continue to receive new event submissions and will be posting RPGA events in the coming weeks so remember to check the registration site for updates.<\/p> <p>Return of the Silent Auction<br\/>The silent auction returns again for GASPcon.

The #1 suggestion each and every year was the need to have a dealers\u2019 room at GASPcon, and we are delivering on that request. We were able to add-on the enclosed space beside our main hall, which we will utilize for both our vendors and demo games. This gives us over 12,000 sq ft of space for this purpose. In addition to the dealer, the Pennsylvania Coin Operated Gaming Hall of Fame and Museum will be attending this year, and will have 2 games available for free play all weekend, including the classic dungeon explorer Gauntlet! If you are interested in being a vendor or have a game in development you wish to highlight, please check out the following link for our vendor packet. <a href=\"https:\/\/dl.dropboxuse\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/dl.dropboxuse<\/a>...\u00ad<\/p> <p>Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator<br\/>Ever want to command a Star Ship, be a science officer or pilot the ship, well this is for you.
