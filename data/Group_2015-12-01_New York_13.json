Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master.

Those who will be attending Summer of NativeScript in September will get the most detailed, and complex look at the runtime as the Telerik team has spent the summer curating videos, powerpoints, and detailed labs which can be custom tailored to your applications needs. That said, Telerik gives us the opportunity to hold three different meet-ups, where you will gain an extremely high-level perspective of the NativeScript runtime; however, if demand for this meet-up is low, we will be forced to condense it into one meet-up, which will be a deep-dive on NativeScript.<\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The time and place of NYC's Summer of NativeScript meet-ups will be announced in the upcoming weeks, so be sure to join to stay updated on any new information!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Below, I have attached the material used thus far for Summer of NativeScript meet-ups.

Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":48,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

Let's share in new life milestones, the anxiety of having the aging or geographically distant parents, or just brunches, late night drinks and pep talks or whatever else it is that siblings do for each other.","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/highres_440837233.jpeg","photo_id":440837233,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/600_440837233.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/thumb_440837233.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":173043482,"name":"Riss","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/c\/d\/highres_248003501.jpeg","photo_id":248003501,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/c\/d\/member_248003501.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/b\/c\/d\/thumb_248003501.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"Only Children Social Support Group","id":18826420,"state":"NY","urlname":"Only-Children-Social-Support-Group","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Only Children"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439394921000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy","name":"Stand Up Comedy","id":29712},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"standup-comedy","name":"standup comedy","id":108531},{"urlkey":"people-that-like-stand-up-comedy","name":"people that like stand up comedy","id":422202},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Yorks-East-Village-Stand-Up-Comedy-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Come to Solas for an intimate evening of hanging and stand up comedy.

I thought to myself, maybe I should try Craigslist. The moment I started to comb through Craigslist for a roommate I got overwhelmed and simply gave up. I couldn't tell who was authentic or who was a bot. The first emails I sent left me bombarded with spam.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I tried two other sites that I will not mention here because it is not important but they could not deliver what I was expecting. Plus, the ritual of going back and forth instead of simply meeting and deciding within a short time and move on with my live was taking too much time. The frustration got to me and if you are here I believe you share this frustration. I have good news for you however. We can take the reins and take back control. Who says we need a third party to find you a roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>This meetup will serve to find to find, professionals like yourself, &nbsp;a roommate that meets your expectations. The success of this meetup will be in direct correlation to your commitment in showing up and participating. Basically, do not waste my time as I will not waster yours.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>The format of the meetup will be the same each week and will be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>1. Pre-populated Questionnaire \u2013 You will only have to do this once and given that your criteria for a roommate does not change you won\u2019t have to do this ever again&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>2. First 10 minutes - Chat or mingle or whatever you New Yorkers want to call it.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>3. Then 20 minutes of \"algorithmically\" matching you up with a roommate. Basically, I will use the information from the questionnaire to match you up with a few people and you get to decide if you want to talk with this person or not.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>4. Then another 25 minutes of you walking over and talking to someone that you think might be a great roommate.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>5. 5 minutes wrap up. You get to hear the success stories of people who found their roommate for that session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/highres_440841330.jpeg","photo_id":440841330,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/600_440841330.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/3\/5\/2\/thumb_440841330.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11996088,"name":"Alfie Walker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/highres_33106662.jpeg","photo_id":33106662,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/member_33106662.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/6\/4\/6\/thumb_33106662.jpeg"}},"members":9,"name":"Roommate Matchup for Professionals - New York City","id":18826991,"state":"NY","urlname":"Roommate-Matchup-for-Professionals-New-York-City","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Alfie"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439411717000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"road-cycling","name":"Road Cycling","id":17259},{"urlkey":"cycling","name":"Cycling","id":18617},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queer-Womens-Cycling-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are many great women's cycling groups in NYC, but this one will focus on the LBTQ community.

Some of us have been using HubSpot for years, some of us run marketing agencies, and some are just starting to learn about Inbound. If you love networking and exploring new ways to grow your business, join us for a meetup!<\/p>\n<p><b>Do I have to be a HubSpot User?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nope! In addition to current users, we welcome anyone interested in learning more about HubSpot or Inbound Marketing in general. That said, our agenda will typically include a deep-dive into some aspect of the HubSpot tools, or a customer case study.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Is this Going to be a Sales Pitch?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>No! The sole purpose of a HUG is to get together and learn the best of HubSpot from one another. A basic tenet of Inbound Marketing is understanding that people hate being sold to. We earn trust through education.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>What's a Typical HUG Agenda Like?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>All HubSpot user groups follow a similar agenda, which includes networking, an educational presentation, and a group discussion. At least twice each year we'll also have guest speakers from HubSpot headquarters join us! Our meetups are casual, helpful, and provide members with complimentary food, drinks and HubSpot SWAG.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>What Should I Bring to the Meet-Up?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Business cards for networking, something to take notes (Wifi will be available, if you want to bring a laptop or tablet), and an open mind for learning and sharing.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Can My Company Host a Meet-Up?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely! One of the more challenging aspects of meetup planning is finding space, so if your company can accommodate a group of 30+, let's chat. We require a location our members can get to easily via major subway lines, high-speed Wifi, a large presentation monitor (or a large screen and laptop projector), enough space for networking, and the ability to bring in food and drinks. In exchange for your hospitality, we'll include your logo and link to your site on our registration landing page, as well as social media promotion.

I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions.

I AM native to the high desert of central Mexico, of Toltec ancestry, born in the land of the Chichimeca. I recently relocated to New York from Los Angeles, CA. and I look forward to contributing sound vibration therapy as a healing art modality. I offer to guide my fellow sound alchemists into a beautiful dream through which we will all reach a zero point state of being. My intention for NY Sound Alchemy is to create a comfortable, invigorating, magical, mysterious, and healing \"sound-bath\/sound-scape\" for my guests. I will play several instruments to relax you and inspire you. <br> <br>I seek to activate your 6 senses. I will offer organic vegan friendly cacao tea and oils to activate the senses accordingly. Very minor adjustments of shoulders before during or after to those who ask. Sage &amp; Palo Santo may also be used. <br> <br>My sonidos curanderos will help wash away all stress, worry and discomfort and the vibrations within our space will unlock your imagination. Together, through breath and sound, we will create a perfect sound-scape; a sonic, phonic arena for your spirit to travel to and through. I invite you to join me and my fellow NY Sonic Shamanic alchemists as we travel with the mind, body and spirit by being present w stillness and contributing a steady thorough breath. <br> <br>Guy Douglas \"The Gong Man\", \"DEEP Exhale\"\/LA and \"Sonic Shamanic\"\/LIB-DoLab-SoCal. are my soundscape progenitors; and what I contribute is a nexus of deep rooted tribal vibrations and an oscillation of fluid, elastic, Cosmic pulsations. You will be raptured by the sounds of a Live Native American flute, Didgeridoo drone pipe, Ocean wave drum, Crystal &amp; Tibetan singing bowls, rain monsoon tower, thunder-maker, serpent rattle, and a sometimes (as inspired) very special Sun language orison; a vernacular tongue which you may surprisingly recognize.

My own friends and loved ones do share some of my musical taste - but how many times can I drag them to see Brandi Carlile, Damien Rice, Gregory Alan Isakov, Amos Lee, Ray LaMontagne, The Decemberists, Lord Huron, Wilco - and so on?? \n\nI've seen you super fans at many shows - you have the same look of bliss on your face that I do - and I wana connect :) So - lets join forces, share upcoming show info, maybe go to shows together, maybe just grab coffee and talk about the music - share experiences, etc... Let's do this!","lon":-73.7799987793,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn

To that end, we want to bridge the gaps that may jeopardize the health and vitality of this and future generations. We will use new tools to fulfill time-tested objectives. To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

A place where we can learn from each other, discuss exciting new frameworks, host Salons on emerging topics, and give everyone an opportunity to help shape the group.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6435034,"name":"Ellery Familia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/c\/highres_62853052.jpeg","photo_id":62853052,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/c\/member_62853052.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/c\/thumb_62853052.jpeg"}},"members":87,"name":"Ad Agency Tech-Lead Meetup","id":18854632,"state":"NY","urlname":"TechLead","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Agency Tech-Leads"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440180416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meetup","name":"Meetup","id":1787},{"urlkey":"organizer","name":"Meetup Organizer","id":10328},{"urlkey":"assistant-organizers","name":"Assistant Organizers","id":46631},{"urlkey":"organizers","name":"Organizers","id":48643},{"urlkey":"organizer-group","name":"Organizer Group","id":70620},{"urlkey":"group-organizers","name":"Group Organizers","id":125082},{"urlkey":"meetup-organizers-only","name":"MeetUp Organizers only","id":1309572},{"urlkey":"meetup-organizers-co_organizers-and-event-hosts","name":"MeetUp Organizers Co_Organizers and Event Hosts","id":1309582},{"urlkey":"meetup-organizers-get-together","name":"MeetUp Organizers Get Together","id":1309592},{"urlkey":"meetup-organizers-helping-each-other","name":"MeetUp Organizers Helping Each Other","id":1309602},{"urlkey":"meetup-leadership","name":"MeetUp Leadership","id":1478752}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Global-DAM-Meetup-Organizers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Collaborative space for organizers of existing Digital Asset Management (DAM) meetups to share knowledge and to provide support and inspiration.

We are going to try something different; we will get together, read a book of our own choosing (you must bring your own book), and afterward, each member will explain to the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>1. What compelled you to choose the book that you were reading.<\/p>\n<p>2. What are your learning from the book, and how are you applying it to life.<\/p>\n<p>3. Convince other members, why they should read the book. <br><\/p>\n<p>In life, you can never tell others what to read, listen to, or watch; their lives, and their desires lead them toward discovering themselves, but you can influence them, and even if they do not follow your lead immediately, they may do so in the future when the need arises. I often see people reading books, and I want to know what they are reading, and why they are reading it. What you are compelled to read, or avoid reading is a reflection of you. It not only matters that you read, what you read matters! Join me at the New York Public Library Schwarzman Building, as I sit among the tourists, and enjoy the works of the masters, and give them their due, by immersing myself in their works. At the conclusion of the 2 hours, we will share our thoughts (each member receiving 5 minutes of time, and I getting the last word before we conclude) about what we are reading, and hopefully we will be able to inspire each other. <br><\/p>\n<p>Join me, and we will travel into the minds of others, use their knowledge, and wisdom to improve ourselves, our lives, and the world that enabled us to be! <br><\/p>\n<p>I just want to warn you guys, that prior to attending this event, I will be practicing Krav Maga. Only a true badass, can practice kicking ass, and then sit down, and enjoy reading a book, while lesser men, resist reading, and want to fight. You can't do the latter without the former, or else the consequences will be severe for you!<\/p>\n<p>This group requires is fee-based (pay-to-play), because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve to motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth.<\/p>\n<p> I am not in the business of collecting members.

The end goal is to engage individuals in a butt kicking workout with drills that can help you kick some butt.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":191848780,"name":"Elevation Pro","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/8\/b\/highres_249223147.jpeg","photo_id":249223147,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/8\/b\/member_249223147.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/8\/8\/b\/thumb_249223147.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Brooklyn Boxing Meetup","id":18870602,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Boxing-Meetup","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Combat Enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440608947000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"healing","name":"Healing","id":16151},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"entheogen","name":"entheogen","id":49474},{"urlkey":"plant-teachers","name":"Plant Teachers","id":65280},{"urlkey":"ayahuasca","name":"ayahuasca","id":88819},{"urlkey":"dmt","name":"DMT","id":101479},{"urlkey":"psychedelic","name":"Psychedelic","id":108995},{"urlkey":"magic-mushrooms","name":"magic mushrooms","id":871892}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entheogen-Integration-Circle\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>A group for those who have had life altering entheogen experiences (or are curious), and would like a community in which to integrate the lessons learned, to create a better world for us all.

They teach us our songs in many ways, for the different ways we learn, and help us to sound and look our best. If you like to sing, and would like to learn about barbershop singing, please give us a call. We rehearse every Thursday night from 7:15 until about 9:45 at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church on Hempstead Turnpike in Levittown. Our chorus is not affiliated with the church - we just rent space. We invite women who want to learn about this great hobby to visit us most any Thursday. If you would like to learn more, please call or text Bobbi: 516-983-2128, or Annette: 631-729-7067 for more information.<\/p>","lon":-73.5199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/d\/b\/highres_441450939.jpeg","photo_id":441450939,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/d\/b\/600_441450939.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/d\/b\/thumb_441450939.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":159671902,"name":"Erica","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/9\/4\/e\/highres_215803342.jpeg","photo_id":215803342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/9\/4\/e\/member_215803342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/9\/4\/e\/thumb_215803342.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Twin County Chorus","id":18874406,"state":"NY","urlname":"Twin-County-Chorus","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440704623000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"landlords","name":"Landlords","id":484},{"urlkey":"realestateagent","name":"Real Estate Agent","id":2027},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-foreclosures","name":"Real Estate Foreclosures","id":15516},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investment-education","name":"Real Estate Investment Education","id":22568},{"urlkey":"beginner-new-real-estate-investor","name":"Beginner Real Estate Investing","id":46403}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/A-NYC-network-date-GROUP\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in meeting people,while networking,not only in the real estate area,but mostly in all work related I started this group because i am a real estate agent,who love meeting people while learning from them.

OUR FOCUS is LOCALISM and driving $$$ and sustainability to your business. We have a signature event called the ReMIXX every month where we feature an entrepreneur. NOW we'd like to meet to determine how we can better address the opportunities and challenges of the local change maker in a more intimate setting Our Goals 1. Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities. Now is the time to join forces to protect, foster, and strengthen the local businesses in our neighborhoods that give us a sense of place, ensure our diverse culture, and provide us with strong unique communities we are proud to call home","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14366314,"name":"Karen Brown-Stovell"},"members":20,"name":"Newark Forward Ever Business Alliance Meetup","id":18889045,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Newark-Forward-Ever-Business-Alliance-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Localists"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441121892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More-testing\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Tus us to nick si do belfry fleet bled Clift sm ni fb agog Cheryl varnish cleon Xbox sm bc clerk Clifty salud cl do all\u00edspey delito vi salvocorreo claro<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":151833872,"name":"Amy ","photo":{"photo_id":204896122,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/member_204896122.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/thumb_204896122.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"More testing","id":18889179,"state":"NY","urlname":"More-testing","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441122327000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"spark","name":"Spark","id":360491},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"apache-spark","name":"Apache spark","id":1471442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spark-Meetup\/","rating":4.75,"description":"NYC Spark users group for those interested in distributed computing technologies.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":117500482,"name":"Matthew Hunt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/highres_229314142.jpeg","photo_id":229314142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/member_229314142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/thumb_229314142.jpeg"}},"members":360,"name":"New York Spark Meetup","id":18889202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Spark-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sparkies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441135114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223},{"urlkey":"social-philanthropy","name":"Social Philanthropy","id":113816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BE-A-FRIEND-Walkathon-2015\/","rating":0,"description":"Join friends, family members and colleagues as you walk, run or stroll along beautiful Hudson River Park in support of Samaritans 24-hour Suicide Prevention Center at our 2nd Annual BE A FRIEND 5K Walkathon, Saturday, September 19.

This group was created by myself Jaleesa a single mom from Brooklyn and my bestie Runisha a single mom from Queens. So let's get together and have fun. We want to create a sisterhood that has something for everyone. We want to have group outings, gym days, seminars, mommy and me time, play dates, as well as mommy time. We want to not only encourage friendship but we all want to help provide support, You want to vent or get things off your chest and out your system then know that you have a sisterhood that is here and ready to listen as well as offer support and encouragement. We're all here to advocate for each other and help each other to thrive not only as moms but in life in general. It is my hope that we're all able to inspire, motivate, and empower each other. Hope to see all of you soon!!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":54144482,"name":"Jaleesa","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/7\/7\/highres_249386231.jpeg","photo_id":249386231,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/7\/7\/member_249386231.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/6\/7\/7\/thumb_249386231.jpeg"}},"members":37,"name":"Single Mother Sisterhood","id":18895920,"state":"NY","urlname":"Single-Mother-Sisterhood","category":{"name":"women","id":35,"shortname":"women"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Sisters"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441295834000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"entarchitecture","name":"Enterprise Architecture","id":3354},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"technology-professionals","name":"Technology Professionals","id":22203},{"urlkey":"information-technology-in-business","name":"Information Technology in Business","id":22239},{"urlkey":"network-infrastructure","name":"Network Infrastructure","id":62769},{"urlkey":"devops","name":"DevOps","id":87614},{"urlkey":"private-cloud","name":"Private Cloud","id":88997},{"urlkey":"it-professionals","name":"IT Professionals","id":164111},{"urlkey":"professionals-of-information-technology","name":"Professionals of Information Technology","id":503482},{"urlkey":"software-defined-networking","name":"Software Defined Networking","id":537492},{"urlkey":"network-architecture","name":"Network Architecture","id":537502},{"urlkey":"enterprise-network-virtualization","name":"Enterprise Network Virtualization","id":1051942},{"urlkey":"sdn","name":"SDN","id":1417742},{"urlkey":"full-stack-development","name":"Full Stack Development","id":1485652}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ONUG-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>In addition to our semi-annual conferences, throughout the year ONUG will conduct smaller user-centered meetings across the country focused on driving open software defined cloud infrastructure.

I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals! Let's travel together and not be conformed to this world BUT see the beautiful world God has created!!! There's so much out there to see and I've only touched 9% of the countries in this world.

One week of energetic enthusiasm would soon turn into making excuses as to why I was too tired or busy to work out. However, one thing I did notice was that if I had an appointment, I always kept it and was never late. I decided to fuse these two characteristics and see if it could help turn things around.<\/p> \n<p>In it together is a meetup for people who want to begin slowly and work their way into a healthier lifestyle and fitness routine. This is not going to be the place where we get together for advanced hot yoga. This is short runs and walks in the reservation or locations close to us (Springfield), group fitness classes, healthy eating\/juice meetups and encouraging each other.

We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws.

The group comes together around playing the sport for fun, not competition and we do not keep score at games. Our games are informal and recreational with an emphasis on NON-competitive play. PICKUP SOCCER NYC is an organized, co-ed recreational group that holds open soccer games year-round several days a week at playing fields across Manhattan. All games are held on full-sized grass\/turf playing fields with anywhere from 12-30 players per given game. Attendance is optional once you sign up and you can attend as few or as many games as you wish. The group is composed of players of all ages, backgrounds and nationalities. We are not a league nor do we use refs or officials. We moderate games ourselves making our own calls. We do not keep score.

I wanted to combine the idea of a cooking party with the \"dinner and a movie\" concept - so basically I and whoever else is interested can cook meals, have drinks (if desired), and we can all decide on a movie to watch afterward (pre-decided if desired). Just looking to see who's interested in this sort of idea - dinner's can be held at different times, I'm a night-owl (I work evening shifts), and it's hard to find late-night meetups similar to this, so for others like me, that tend to eat\/sleep late (midnight dinners are pretty common), this would be perfect for you! BUT! There would definitely be \"normal\" dinner meetups too occasionally. If this sounds like something you're interested in, please join! I'm open to figuring out how to do this the best way, so any input is appreciated!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":93041022,"name":"Glenn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/highres_250325760.jpeg","photo_id":250325760,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/member_250325760.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/thumb_250325760.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Brooklyn Cooking & a Movie Meetup","id":18955452,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Cooking-a-Movie-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442888546000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"saas-software-as-a-service","name":"SaaS (Software as a Service)","id":33089},{"urlkey":"the-cloud","name":"The Cloud","id":86100},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-in-cloud","name":"Business Intelligence in Cloud","id":87886},{"urlkey":"private-cloud","name":"Private Cloud","id":88997},{"urlkey":"iaas-infrastructure-as-a-service","name":"IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)","id":107633},{"urlkey":"cloud-security","name":"Cloud Security","id":110474},{"urlkey":"building-private-cloud-with-openstack","name":"Building private cloud with OpenStack","id":140254},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing-security","name":"Cloud Computing Security","id":141165},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing-how-to-use-it-for-your-business","name":"\"Cloud Computing\" How to use it for your business","id":158625},{"urlkey":"cloud-identity","name":"Cloud Identity","id":165237},{"urlkey":"cloud-networking","name":"Cloud Networking","id":509242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Cloud-Academy\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>The New York City Cloud Academy is a New York City based cloud community group.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages.

You've wanted to try coaching but haven't because of time commitment, money, or any other blocks. You have a big dream but you're afraid to act. You know there's a better way to live, but you're not living that way now. You want to meet other soul-minded individuals in your neighborhood. You still haven't found what you're looking for (cue U2). You have no idea what the fuck coaching is but all of the above sounds pretty awesome.

It's a forum for sharing and discussing new research and exciting advances in theoretical physics and computational biology. Several approaches to unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity, influenced in part by the discovery of the holographic principle, prompt us to break up spacetime itself into chucks (the same way we break down matter into particles). Matter and the laws of physics, then, emerge from the changing of the states of these chunks based on the states of neighboring chunks, as though our universe is one large cellular automaton - a computer program. I recommend the paper by Tommaso Bolognesi entitled \"Algorithmic Causal Sets for a Computational Spacetime,\" which can be found in Hector Zenil's collection of essays \"A Computable Universe: Understanding and Exploring Nature as Computation.\" There's also a TV program named Closer to Truth that dedicates some episodes to exploring information as the fundamental reality and the universe as a computation. But wait, I thought matter and energy are fundamental!?! Well, \"Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement...\" of matter and energy. There is a proof by contradiction that everything (matter, mind, and processes) is composed of information, and there is another proof by contradiction that information cannot be reduced to matter. If information is the fundamental reality and the complexity of physics emerges from simplicity, it prompts a scientific paradigm shift from a top-down to a bottom-up understanding of nature. In the study of the mind, Tononi's Integrated Information Theory is one example of an approach to resolve the hard problem of consciousness using information as the fundamental ingredient. I recommend the paper \"Is Consciousness Computable? Quantifying Integrated Information Using Algorithmic Information Theory.\" Gregory Chaitlin's metabiology is an interesting attempt to model evolution in the framework of algorithmic information theory. Let's see if we can pull together the pieces of the puzzle of existence and evolution.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/highres_442347205.jpeg","photo_id":442347205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/600_442347205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/4\/5\/thumb_442347205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":153712592,"name":"Dan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/1\/5\/highres_249970773.jpeg","photo_id":249970773,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/1\/5\/member_249970773.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/1\/5\/thumb_249970773.jpeg"}},"members":46,"name":"Digital Philosophy, Consciousness, and Quantum Gravity","id":18962475,"state":"NY","urlname":"Digital-Philosophy-Consciousness-and-Quantum-Gravity","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"combinatorial hierarchies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443104375000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"oilinvesting","name":"Oil & Gas Investing","id":8707},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-professionals","name":"Business Professionals","id":16922},{"urlkey":"value-investing","name":"Value Investing","id":18616},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"energy","name":"Energy","id":21396},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"oil-and-gas","name":"oil and gas","id":23448},{"urlkey":"electricity-and-natural-gas","name":"Electricity and Natural Gas","id":30525},{"urlkey":"hedge-fund","name":"Hedge Fund","id":30701},{"urlkey":"investment-management","name":"Investment Management","id":52639},{"urlkey":"petroleum","name":"Petroleum","id":69433},{"urlkey":"investor","name":"Investor","id":77938},{"urlkey":"oil-gas-and-mining-industry","name":"Oil gas and mining industry","id":173031}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Oil-Gas-Energy-Investing-Forum\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A forum to discuss the global energy markets, share ideas, and network.

Unlike a traditional networking group we will have seminars and growth will take place at non-traditional venues such as store, nail salons and dermatologist offices, etc. (open to suggestions!!!). As women always on the move we are constantly running from place to place, this form of networking happens while shopping or understanding how transition your make-up from day to night, or accomplishing a fitness goal. I am well connected through out NYC to host several events of this nature.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting? Each meeting will consist of a forum providing compliance advice for a specific aspect of the technology sector (e.g. WCAG guidelines for website\/app design, payment systems compliance issues, cryptocurrency issues, etc...), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A for items to be discussed either at that meeting or answered in the following meeting. The meetings will start in November and will be held on a monthly basis. We look forward to seeing you there!

I am a father of an amazing 16 month old boy who is the center of my universe. I work Mon-Fri, dusk till dawn saving for all the wonderful things we want to provide our son with. This leaves me little time to connect with other parents and to meet other parents that share the same family focused lifestyle that we live. Now we all know how it goes...Lots of friends and going out and social time before the baby...but after the baby comes, you just don't have the time to do all of that anymore and those friends without kids seem to drift away slowly but surely...So this is the reason I am starting this group. I'm a dad who loves football (especially fantasy football and watching football on Sundays), loves going out to eat, loves dressing my son up as cute as possible to get the most people to compliment him as possible when I take him out (admit it, we all do it!). I'm looking to meetup with easy going people who will connect with the much more simplistic lifestyle of having kids but still want to meet up and have fun once every week or two. Kids are welcome for any meetups, I mean heck, that's the whole purpose I'm posting this is because we are parents! We can meet at parks, restaurants, houses, etc... Essentially wherever people feel will be best. Just a dad, looking to connect with other dads. Sunday football outings with or without the kids would definitely be a plus! :)","lon":-73.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193235116,"name":"Joseph Perez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/c\/1\/highres_250090177.jpeg","photo_id":250090177,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/c\/1\/member_250090177.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/c\/1\/thumb_250090177.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Forest Hills Dads Meetup","id":18967515,"state":"NY","urlname":"Forest-Hills-Dads-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dads having fun with other dads"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Metuchen","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443213006000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"sleepdisorders","name":"Sleeping Disorder","id":1926},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating","name":"Healthy Eating","id":19630},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"solve-sleep-problems","name":"Solve Sleep Problems","id":56199},{"urlkey":"sleep","name":"Sleep","id":119381},{"urlkey":"healthy-eating-for-energy-and-good-health","name":"Healthy Eating For Energy and Good Health","id":444332}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Central-Jersey-Sleep-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a support group for people who find it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Once that state is achieved sleep occurs naturally, by itself. However, it is not possible for us to force our mind to relax. How then do we relax our mind? Certain tools and techniques are available \u2013 Yoga, breathing Techniques and meditation \u2013 that help us get rid of stress and negative emotions. These techniques calm the mind and allow us to get a good night's sleep. Lifestyle also has a big impact on one\u2019s stress level, state of mind and quality of sleep.

These practices are designed to Restore and Maintain one's youth full vigor while at the same time they help to restore our Physical, Mental and Emotional selves to a calm and positive state. Everyone is encouraged to work at their own pace whether it be gentle or vigorous depending on their own body's needs.
