The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 400 and 900+ calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique \u2013 all while rocking out to your favorite music!<\/p> <p>Through continual upper body motion using our lightly weighted drumsticks, called Ripstix\u2122, you'll turn into a calorie-torching drummer, POUNDing off pounds as each song flies by. Rock, rap, dubstep, pop and old school music fuse to create the POUNDtrack series, which is hand-selected by music enthusiasts, drummers and POUND founders Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom.<\/p> <p>GET RIPPED WITH RIPSTIX\u2122<\/p> <p>What would a drumming workout be without drumsticks? We\u2019ve invented unique, lightly weighted exercise drumsticks that have been specially designed to get you ripped \u2014 hence the name: Ripstix\u2122<\/p> <p>Twice the weight of a standard drumstick (\u00bc lb each) and slightly shorter in length, Ripstix are designed to maximize your workout by alter the physics of your arm movement to burn more calories<\/p> <p>IT WORKS.<\/p> <p>POUND combines easy to follow (and not complex or embarrassing) cardio moves with strength training and drumming. This combo works the entire body, raises the heart rate to a fat-burning zone, and forces each move to be as precise as a basic beat.<\/p> <p>Each 2-4 minute song is carefully calibrated with interval peaks and extended fat burning sequences, providing you with the best workout in the shortest span of time. After you\u2019re done rocking out to the 45-minute POUNDtrack, you\u2019ll have done 15,000 reps, performed over 30 extended interval peaks, and zipped through over 70 techniques without even realizing it<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI am offering 1 week free, then a 15.00 contribution to workout material is appreciated per week.\u00a0<\/p> <p>please watch my video to get an idea of how much fun we can have getting that beach body! \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEfy9XKiqQc<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>please visit my website: catgarlo.com\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0facebook: CatGarloFitness\u00a0and see some reviews.

Old and young will enjoy learning how to use the songs creatively and how to include them in their daily routines. We invite non-German speakers to join in as well, and make sure that everyone can follow easily. The classes are age appropriately designed. They are infused with finger plays, dance segments and instrument exploration and provide a rich environment for music development, creativity and cognitive development. Learning a language through music is very effective. Rhythm and melody help the brain to memorize with ease. The latest research shows that music has a unique way in activating speech pathways.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school.

We are not accepting any players at this time but if you send me a direct message, I will make a point to reach out to you if a spot does open up.<\/p> <p><br\/>INTRODUCTION:Until just days ago, most members of our party were blissfully unaware of the Keys of Power and their creator, the Aramago. Even those that had any inkling of these topics thought the stories they\u2019d heard to be mere legends. Then one of the Keys of Power was almost literally dropped in their lap. They were suddenly running for their lives guarding Melrick, the courier ferrying that item to a safe place.<\/p> <p><br\/>Now, Melrick is dead and the party is cast adrift in an alien realm of existence. What\u2019s worse, they\u2019ve been separated from more than half of their number with seemingly no hope to reunite with them. So Theron, Clovis, and Drom cast about for ways to return to their home plane, reunite with their comrades, and most importantly, convey the precious cargo they carry to its rightful place.<\/p> <p><br\/>However, all is not lost. Potential new allies have stepped forward. Already the elven ranger Thamior has shown his worth by warning the party of an impending ambush and nearly dying in helping to fight it off. And he\u2019s introduced them to two more he knows can be trusted once the four of them reach the tiny village they hope will be a safe haven. They have just begun to relax for a\u00a0much-needed\u00a0warm meal when a gypsy strolls into the tavern and engages them directly with a desperate plea for help.<\/p> <p><br\/>BACKGROUND:\"The Keeper of the Keys\" is a home-brewed, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. It is a shell that encompasses the numerous, separate adventures the players will enjoy during an\u00a0epic\u00a0quest to recover all the Keys of Power.<\/p> <p><br\/>This game is one of two, biweekly games I am running in the Central Jersey D&amp;D MeetUp group under the banner of\u00a0\u201cAdventures in Azocar\u201d. It meets on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month. We may also have additional meetings if there\u2019s a fifth Thursday in any given month but mostly, this will probably be kept open for make-up games.<\/p> <p><br\/>I am looking for a group of players willing to commit to the schedule I propose; players whose attendance will not be an issue. These players also need to be ready to be involved in a long-running game. I know this because each time I've run \"The Keeper of the Keys\", it's encompassed almost the entirety of the PC's lifespan as adventurers.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/229780247\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"The Keeper of the Keys - An Azocar Adventure","id":"xcvsrlyvgbsb","time":1460673000000,"updated":1460756995000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07735","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Keyport","address_1":"50 West Front Street","name":"Keyport Mini Park","lon":-74.203697,"id":7696142,"state":"NJ","lat":40.436943,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":24.412979126,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459782296000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/600_90497812.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nOk peeps warmer weather is upon us and I am going to start scheduling some walks because its the only way to make sure I don't find an excuse or something else I desperately need to do.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

He\u2019s the lead designer at touchlab, and a Google Expert in UIUX. At touchlab, Liam helps partners craft Android experiences with great design as a foundational principle, whether the product is Android-first or expanding from other platforms.<\/p> <p><b>Title:<\/b> Mutative design and what it's like to use a mutative interface<\/p> <p><b>Description: <\/b>Mutative design is a theoretical design methodology that would allow interfaces and experiences to be born, live, and evolve according to a user\u2019s realities.<\/p> <p>With mutative design, things like physical ability, lighting, and vision are accounted for automatically, allowing interfaces to be engaging and accessible to every user, without compromise.<\/p> <p>In this session I\u2019ll give a brief overview of the rationale and process behind mutative design and take a look at the first mutative sample app - Selene. We\u2019ll walk through Selene\u2019s first mutations and explore the design considerations mutation introduces.<\/p> <p><b>Talk 2:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Speaker:<\/b> Ernest Grzybowski<\/p> <p><b>Title:<\/b> Introduction to Material design<\/p> <p><b>Description:<\/b> Material design has come a long way since it was introduced at Google I\/O in 2014. I'll do an overview of Material for those that are less familiar and teach you about the components and strategies you can take into your day to day development cycle.

In the mid-1870s, Degas was introduced to the monotype process\u2014drawing in ink on a metal plate that was then run through a press, typically resulting in a single print. Captivated by the monotype\u2019s potential, he immersed in the technique with enormous enthusiasm, taking the medium to radical ends. He expanded the possibilities of drawing, created surfaces with a heightened sense of tactility, and invented new means for new subjects, from dancers in motion to the radiance of electric light, from women in intimate settings to meteorological effects in nature. The monotype also sparked a host of experiments for Degas, who often used the medium as a starting point from which an image could be reworked and revised. This process of repetition and transformation, mirroring and reversal, allowed Degas to extend his approach to the study of form. The profound impact of his work with monotype can be seen in his variations in different mediums of key motifs, revealing a new kind of artwork that was less about progress or completion than endless innovation.<\/p> <p><br\/>The exhibition includes approximately 120 rarely-seen monotypes\u2014along with some 50 related paintings, drawings, pastels, sketchbooks, and prints\u2014that show Degas at his most modern, capturing the spirit of urban life; depicting the body in new and daring ways; liberating mark-making from tradition; and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction.<\/p> <p>AND\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>From the Collection: 1960\u20131969<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/a\/4\/600_448216548.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 <i>Above<\/i>: Yayoi Kusama (Japanese, born 1929). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<i>Accumulation No. 1.<\/i> 1962.

The presentation is organized through the lens of the 1960s, when inter-disciplinary artistic experimentation flourished and traditional mediums were radically transformed. Artistic change paralleled socio-political upheaval around the globe, and these seismic shifts reach to the present. The galleries feature works across media, including paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, architecture, design objects, videos, films, and archival materials.<\/p> <p>The installation includes a range of works from the 1960s, including a Jaguar E-Type Roadster (1961), a selection from Bela Kol\u00e1rov\u00e1\u2019s photographic body of work Radiogram of Circle (1962\u201363), Nam June Paik\u2019s Zen for TV (1963), James Rosenquist\u2019s F-111 (1964\u201365), Jo Baer\u2019s Primary Light Group: Red, Green, Blue [masked]), Robert Smithson\u2019s drawing <i>A Heap of Language <\/i>(1966), Bonnie Maclean\u2019s poster for the Yardbirds and the Doors (1967), Eva Hesse\u2019s <i>Repetition Nineteen<\/i> (1968), a group of works related to Superstudio\u2019s The Continuous Monument: New York Extrusion Project, New York, New York (1969), and Nalini Malani\u2019s film <i>Dream Houses <\/i>(1969), among many others.<\/p> <p>Each gallery is dedicated to works from a single year, and the galleries proceed in chronological order. This approach provides a framework for displaying a wide-ranging selection of objects from the Museum\u2019s collection, offering visitors a rare opportunity to see an automobile in proximity to an oil painting, an etching juxtaposed with an architectural model, or a film alongside a sculpture. The organizational principles vary throughout: some galleries explore the potential of unexpected connections across mediums and genres while others gather works that are similar in materials or function.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/9\/c\/6\/600_447430694.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The Free Friday line cues up starting at 2:30 P.M. for 4 P.M. entry.

In response to a lunch time discussion about extraterrestrials, he asked the question \u201cWhere is Everybody?\u201d (i.e.\u00a0where\u00a0are extraterrestrials).\u00a0 This became known as the<b>\u00a0Fermi Paradox<\/b>\u00a0(1950).

Some of them might develop intelligent life.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Following this reasoning, Frank Drake predicted the existence of tens of thousands of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations (ETC) and Carl Sagan likewise predicted perhaps a million ETC.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0At least some of these ETC\u2019s must be millions or even billions of years more advanced than us.

In contrast to leading conceptual art practices of the 1970s, Clemente refocused attention on representation, narrative, and the figure, and explored traditional, artisanal materials and modes of working. Since his first trip to India in the 1970s, Francesco Clemente immersed himself in the country\u2019s rich cultures as well as the everyday life and artistic practices of local people. Transforming ancient symbols, myths, and ideas, he has created a personal visual language of dreamlike landscapes, animals, and human figures drawn from recollections of his travels. Themes of sexuality, mythology, and spirituality, along with imaginary narratives of violence, intrigue, fragmentation, love, separation, and jealousy are seen throughout his oeuvre.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nEvery Friday the K2 Lounge offers a special pan-Asian tapas menu to accompany the evening's DJ and programs.

Each of these artists fills their compositions with objects, bodies and places that are based on reality, yet are exaggerated, recontextualized, simplified or flattened. The individual works are imbued with both the uncertainty of our sociopolitical moment as well as the seductive quality of consumerism and physical attraction.

In addition to a sleeping bag, you need a very good sleeping pad. It is important to have insulation between you and the ground. The filling in your sleeping bag that is underneath you will be compressed and provide no insulation. I highly recommend a sleeping pad with an R value of at least 5. (Hint: most closed cell foam pads have a 2.5 R value. If you double them up you will have a combined R value of 5.)<\/p> <p>You will also need something to keep the weather off of you while you sleep. Since we're below the tree line, any small 3 season tent should do. You want something with good ventilation so that you don't get soaked in condensation over night.<\/p> <p>I also ask that all participants bring a small bundle of wood. You can purchase local wood. There are strict regulations on transporting firewood within the State of New York. If you plan to carry wood from home, it must be kiln dried. If you want to see why this is so important, go check out the birch trees in the Adirondacks.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/2\/600_446012578.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/f\/4\/d\/600_446012589.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hvhikers\/events\/229935262\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Spring Camping in the Taconics","id":"229935262","time":1460761200000,"updated":1460773477000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1229395389000,"name":"Hudson Valley Hikers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1338658,"urlname":"hvhikers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"HV Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10016","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"28 East 35th St.","name":"Community Church of New york","lon":-73.98189,"id":9441782,"state":"NY","lat":40.747936,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":12,"distance":0.4486528337,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459178283000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come learn, practice, and speak with other Esperantists.

Enrico Fermi was Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics. In response to a lunch time discussion about extraterrestrials, he asked the question \u201cWhere is Everybody?\u201d (i.e. where are extraterrestrials). This became known as the <b>Fermi Paradox<\/b> (1950). The basic points of the arguments are:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If there is nothing special about Earth or humanity, then whatever is true here should be true elsewhere in the galaxy.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun and some of these stars will have Earth-like planets. Some of them might develop intelligent life.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Following this reasoning, Frank Drake predicted the existence of tens of thousands of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations (ETC) and Carl Sagan likewise predicted perhaps a million ETC. At least some of these ETC\u2019s must be millions or even billions of years more advanced than us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, thus they should have already reached Earth and we should have detected their existence by now.<\/p> <p>So, \u201cWhere is Everybody?!\u201d Something must be wrong with this chain of reasoning so, we will review about 30 solutions to the Fermi Paradox and even create our own solution.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/e\/d\/600_448702509.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our gust\u00a0<b>Seth Shostak\u00a0<\/b>will lead part of the talk.

In this interactive lecture, Shelby Keizer will take us through the 12 archetypes of self and their relationship to the Hero\u2019s Journey, in order to help us identify how we relate to these archetypes and, based on this, how to make changes in our lives that will impact our pursuits.<\/p> <p>This lecture will explain concepts such as the Left Hand Path and self-knowledge through engaging activities and questions. The works of Aleister Crowley, Julius Evola, Carl Jung and others will be discussed in order to create a vocabulary and foundation for the concepts being introduced.<\/p> <p>Always led by insatiable curiosity about the unknown, Shelby has been exploring the esoteric and occult worlds for the past five years. Her interests are diverse and include, among others: ritual magic, how to induce altered states of consciousness, enlightenment and divine will, spirits and otherworldly beings, ancient Egyptian mythology, and the Kabbalah<\/p> <p>NOTE:<\/p> <p>The Writing Room is a restaurant that has a rich history. It used to be Elaine's, where literary greats used to hang out with Woody Allen around the bar until the enigmatic owner passed away. The Library is the back area where we will be meeting.

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in NYC?<\/p> <p><br\/>We play 3 communication game (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p><b>How long will the meetup be?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend.

Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p><b>Do members need to bring anything?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come?

Before I knew it, I'm already one-third of the way towards the 35er. So, I decided to bag the rest and get a precious patch and sticker! LOL In this hike, we will bag 3 of the 3500 series, including Wittenberg, Cornell and Slide mountains. To make the hike little more challenging, we will do the reverse route, which is going to give us 3700 feet total elevation gain as opposed to 2600' from the other way around. The average pace of the hike will be 2~2.5 miles\/hour, including the breaks in between. In other words, we will maintain 3~3.5 miles\/hour pace while in motion for the stretch of 9 miles. I will refrain myself from using descriptive adjectives like fast, brisk, moderate, slow, as we all have different skills and experience level, but I can certainly assure you that it is not suitable for the beginners. Unless someone volunteers to be the sweep, you will have to navigate yourself out, as the leader will not wait for the strugglers more than 10 minutes at the junctions. So study the map, know exactly where you are going and bring a regional trail map and compass, if not a GPS device. Even though it has been the warmest winter with barely any snow, expect some icy patch along the trail, esp. higher up in the altitude. So, don't forget to bring traction devices. As always, better be safe than sorry! The leader will be renting either a 5- or 7-passenger vehicle based on the number of registrants and offer a ride from a central location in Manhattan. All the trip-associated costs will be shared amongst the participants. To secure a spot in the car, you must register via email, FB messenger or Meetup private message by EOD 3\/31 (Thurs). The leader will book a car two weeks ahead of the event before the fee skyrockets.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AMCYoungMembers\/events\/229628798\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Young Members - Catskill 3500 Series: Wittenberg\/Cornell\/Slide Mountains","id":"229628798","time":1460811600000,"updated":1460990266000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1224562109000,"name":"Appalachian Mountain Club - Young Members","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1305506,"urlname":"AMCYoungMembers","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Young Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":10,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460241458000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NYC trail option:<\/p> <p>Let's join the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/blockhouserunclub\/\">Blockhouse run<\/a>,\u00a0and do some Spring running together in Central Park!

You will traverse very dangerous and steep mountains-considered the deadliest trails of the continental US. The intensity of the hike is comparable to an ultra-marathon (8hrs approx.). This is unlike any other hikes we have had and it is specifically designed to challenge the explorers physically and mentally. While you will demonstrate strong leadership skills, you will also have to be able to overcome mental and physical obstacles. The team dynamics is crucial in this expedition. This is not a race, but is a team ruck where you must be willing to push yourself outside your comfort zone and have a \"do not quit attitude\". Once you complete the 13 mile extremely difficult hike you will earn a one of a kind patch. You will be a stronger and better person. This event will test your limits and bring your fitness to the next level. This hike is for those who are creative and who are independent. You MUST have a car in order to get to the meeting point. We will have a guide and a sweeper to make sure nobody gets lost. Professional photos and T-shirts are also included in the cost. We will move as a unit. Meal and beverage will be provided. You will be cold and wet (you need to pack extra clothes); we will not be camping however you will be required to bring the required gear on the list below. Once you are done with the expedition we will provide you a shuttle back to your car. Again, this is in a wilderness area. There is no public transportation to the meeting spot. No animals are allowed on this hike (it is very steep); You MUST be 18 or older. Once you sign up we will email you specific details (the gear that you need and the meeting place and time). Please read the message carefully before you sign up. Do you have what it takes to tackle the hardest trek in the US? Are you adventurous? Do you like to push your limits? Are you a team player? If YES then this expedition is for you. Each member MUST respect and support one another. We will have less advanced hikes throughout the year. This is our advanced level. We wish you best of luck!

Tammany, Sunfish Pond and Dunnfield Creek. The 1,547-foot Mt. Tammany towers 1,200 feet above the Delaware River, offering some of the best scenic views in the state. Sunfish Pond is a glacial pond set atop of the Kittatinny Ridge; its crystal waters and serene setting entice visitors to return. Make sure to check out the various rock structures that inspired hikers have left to honor the beauty of the area. Dunnfield Creek\u2019s pristine, cascading waters, set off by towering hemlocks and mixed hardwood trees, is an experience not to miss. Opportunities for viewing wildlife abound along the various trails that crisscross this area. Details: The hike will start at the base of the Delaware Water Gap and ascend to the top of Mt. Tammany. This is a steep climb and probably the most strenuous part of the hike where the hike gains about 1200ft in elevation. From Mt. Tammany The RED DOT trail ends at the summit. Left on Blue down Mt.

This hike is one of the most memorable outdoor experiences in the Hudson Valley, or anywhere else. As a reward for wedging yourself through rock formations and volunteering to be a human lemon in the Lemon Squeeze, you\u2019ll pop out onto a ledge with awesome views of the Mohonk Preserve and beyond. Then you can turn around and find the Sky Top Tower right behind you, begging to be climbed. From up there, you can pretty much see the whole world. It\u2019s an amazing experience and truly my favorite in the Hudson Valley region and possibly the state!<br\/>Entrance onto the grounds is $26pp but I promise you it is well worth it! After the hike we'll head to downtown New Paltz to hit up one of their lively pubs for a bite to eat and some libations.

Children, including underage teenagers, should be RSVP'ed as a guest their parent, guardian or responsible adult; drop me a message and I will put your child (or underage teenager) in as your guest if guest function is disabled. This does not mean that this is a children's level hike, or if it's a activity that it child appropriate - it is not unless stated so above, but some children are more then able to do a adult level hike and attend events that are not normally well suited for many children such as meditative events.<\/p> <p><b>Guests: <\/b>Adults need to sign up directly and may not go as guests. Guest function, if enabled for this hike, is only for children (and teens who have not reached the age of majority).<\/p> <p><b>No Shows\/ short notice canceling\/waitlisted\/ not helping out such as with car shuttles:<\/b> Known 'No shows' may be waitlisted, and \/ or excluded from the event if there is a max number of hikers set. Repeat short notice canceling will also be noted for consideration for this as well as things like bypassing the car shuttle location. No-showing \/ short notice canceling prevents others from attending if the event is full. Bypassing the car shuttle start location is taking advantage of others (also see 'Arriving Late: Don't do that' section). Make sure you sign in, you would not want to be accidentally marked as a no-show, additionally frequently a spots are reserved for those who are known to attend and be on time.<\/p> <p><b>Arriving Late: <\/b>Don't do that, you may be on your own. If you are late, we can only wait if it would be advantageous for the group to wait, so don't be late. We will try to get you back on track, but those mornings are very hectic and my first responsibility would need to be to those hikers that have arrived. You may not get to hike with us, additionally we may not have room to get you back to your vehicle at the end if that is required.<\/p> <p><b>End of Hike Time: <\/b>Ignore the Meetup end time, that is my suggestion for every meetup you attend, not just mine, that is unless you know the event host uses that. The reason is that Meetup assumes a end time and if the event organizer does not change it it just gives out a standard one. Hikes normally move at 2mph, bushwack sections and scrambles at 1 to 1.5 mph, and any car shuttle set up time if needed for this event. so if the millage is specified one can easily figure out a rough estimate.

No coordination of rides. The 3:37 train gets you back to Grand Central at 3:59, or you can take the bus and subway back. Bring lunch and beverage, or buy it in the cafeteria. No pets; no smoking.
