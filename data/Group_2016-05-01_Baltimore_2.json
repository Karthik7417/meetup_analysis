Insight Meditation trains us to live more fully in the present moment, enables us to experience life from a greater stillness, and aids us in relating to both ourselves and others with increased clarity, compassion, calmness and creativity, and less fear, anxiety and stress.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these and a long list of other psychological benefits, meditation has also been shown to reduce stress hormones in the body, lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, alleviate depression and boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<p>What we offer: Our ongoing drop-in Tuesday evening classes generally consist of one or two half hour semi-guided meditations, mindful movement, a talk on Buddhist principles and their application to daily life, followed by discussion and\/or practice.<\/p>\n<p>We offer workshops (typically day long) to help deepen practice. Some of our workshop topics are: Deepening Insight, a Daylong Silent Workshop; Insight Out Loud (working with partners to deepen insight); A Day of Heart Practices; Deepening Presence; and a Relationship Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Our 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses help students initiate and develop an ongoing daily mindfulness meditation practice. These 8-week courses are designed to help students develop strategies to reduce stress and to relate to their day-to-day experiences in a more calm and creative manner.<\/p>\n<p>We also sponsor Kalyani-Mitta (KM) groups. These are groups that meet outside the normal class hours to discuss Buddhist principles more in depth and to share about how these ideas apply to their personal lives. These groups also help foster deeper connection to other members of the community (sangha).<\/p>\n<p><b>Teachers:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Stan Eisenstein, MSW<\/b>,&nbsp;is a former high school physics teacher who has been meditating for&nbsp;30 years and has been practicing Insight Meditation since 2004.

Not only will you grow in Christ, but you will also form godly friendships as you spiritually form together.","lon":-76.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":101063542,"name":"Shyrielane Watson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/c\/d\/highres_247620973.jpeg","photo_id":247620973,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/c\/d\/member_247620973.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/c\/d\/thumb_247620973.jpeg"}},"members":21,"name":"Laurel Christian Spiritual Formation Meetup","id":18720110,"state":"MD","urlname":"Laurel-Christian-Spiritual-Formation-Meetup","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":39.0999984741,"who":"Remnants"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1436114727000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wine","name":"Wine","id":611},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Silver-Spring-Wine-and-Book-Club\/","rating":4.8,"description":"<p><span>***Ladies only book club!***<\/span><span><br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Have you ever finished reading a good book and wish you had someone to discuss the book with?

Each moment spent dwelling on the past that is over or imagining a future that is unknown, is a moment stolen from our Life right here and now. The now is what holds the Joy, Enthusiasm, Peace, Calm, Clarity, Efficiency, Productivity. Neither at home, nor in school are we taught skills on how to live in the now. The secret to living in the now, is hidden in the breath. <br><\/p>\n<p>Come explore the breath, and experience the magic through yogic breathing taught by trained teachers from the <b>Art of Living Foundaiton<\/b>.

Our meetings include discussions, sharing own experiences - both - as facilitators\/therapists and clients, social outings, field trips, group meditations and hypnosis. <br><\/p>\n<p>Past Life Regression Therapy is based on the theory of reincarnation.

Often Past Life Regression can reveal the root cause of a present symptom. Often just the matter of uncovering those memories is enough for the symptoms to disappear on it's own.<\/p>\n<p>Some people seek this kind of therapy with hopes to improve their health. Some people desire this experience out of pure curiosity. The outcome is the same - their life change in a very positive way.

You've never had a ton of friends--just a few very close ones over the years. You meet people all the time, but you may find it hard to make real connections because you can be shy. And people often mistake your shyness for being uptight, snooty, aloof, unapproachable, weird, or uninterested. But that's not you at all. You're compassionate. Considerate. Thoughtful. Caring. Adventurous. Creative. Quirky. Unique. You're an awesome friend, but you don't always get the chance to show that. Guess what? You're not alone. I've been judged for being \"different\"--left out of groups, wondering why no one seemed to understand me or like me. And I've always wanted friendships with Black women who could look beyond stereotypes and connect with the real me. You too may want those kinds of friendships. This group is the place for that.

The first Meetup, located in Charlotte, has been very beneficial to those women in need and my desire to start one in the Charm City has now come to fruition. Join me January 16, 2016 for our first meetup scheduled alongside our one year anniversary! Look for our next meetup coming to D.C and VA - keeping my promise to establish meetups in the DMV area. Please share. We need your support!!<\/p>\n<p>Who We Are: &lt;br&gt;<\/p>\n<p>We are a group of black women coming together to support, empower and fellowship while moving forward. We will meet to share, have fun, cry, laugh and grow. We will have various events and empowerment meetings and sharing sessions. Each Villager must make a vow upon joining. It's simple, you must vow to help at least one Villager in some form or fashion while a member of the group. This could be by way of encouraging, mentoring, praying or any way you feel that inspires or brings a smile on the face of another. This group's mission is to enjoy life and each other while having fun while moving forward. *This Meetup is an extension of the Charlotte (NC) Black Women Widows Moving Forward Meetup and The Strong Black Women Grieve Blog and Facebook communities below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com\">www.StrongBlackWomenGrieve.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strongblackwomengrieve\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Blackwomenwidowsempowered\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>LET'S MOVE FORWARD!<\/p>","lon":-76.6200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/highres_444131677.jpeg","photo_id":444131677,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/600_444131677.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/9\/d\/thumb_444131677.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":104588872,"name":"Sabra Robinson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/a\/0\/highres_254464256.jpeg","photo_id":254464256,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/a\/0\/member_254464256.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/a\/0\/thumb_254464256.jpeg"}},"members":7,"name":"Baltimore Black Women Widows Moving Forward","id":19103406,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Black-Women-Widows-Moving-Forward","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Baltimore BWW Villagers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Annapolis","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447166009000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"xp","name":"Extreme Programming","id":5938},{"urlkey":"scrum","name":"Scrum","id":10043},{"urlkey":"agile-project-management","name":"Agile Project Management","id":21549},{"urlkey":"test-driven-development","name":"Test Driven Development","id":25435},{"urlkey":"kanban","name":"Kanban","id":37339},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"lean-project-management","name":"Lean Project Management","id":118991},{"urlkey":"pragmatic-software-development","name":"Pragmatic Software Development","id":120095},{"urlkey":"agile-coaching","name":"Agile Coaching","id":122939},{"urlkey":"scrum-in-real-world","name":"Scrum in real world","id":169867},{"urlkey":"software-development-technologies","name":"Software Development Technologies","id":172426},{"urlkey":"agile-leadership","name":"Agile Leadership","id":438272},{"urlkey":"agile-transformation","name":"Agile Transformation","id":438282}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Annapolis-MD-Scrum-User-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Welcome to the Annapolis MD Scrum User Group!

All skill levels are welcome, from those who mistakenly think they are not creative to those artistic, crafty women who want to get back to creating. We will meet every Thursday evening at Catylator Makerspace, a gorgeous facility in downtown Silver Spring. Each week we will pick a project or craft to complete, such as chalk painting, jewelry making or paper crafting, based on the interests and requests from the group. Come just when a project interests you, or come every week for the fun and social aspects. We will have light refreshments, but bring your own wine :). All supplies will be included, and there will be a fee for each class which will cover materials and the rental of the space.","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185070044,"name":"kathryn neel"},"members":680,"name":"Women's Upscale Craft Studio","id":19124372,"state":"MD","urlname":"Womens-Upscale-Craft-Studio","category":{"name":"hobbies\/crafts","id":15,"shortname":"hobbies-crafts"},"lat":39,"who":"Artists and Crafters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447620577000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-marriage-minded","name":"Christian Singles Marriage Minded","id":15378},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"divorced-single-never-married-christian-singles","name":"Divorced,Single,Never Married Christian Singles","id":25392},{"urlkey":"christian-women","name":"Christian Women","id":31382},{"urlkey":"christian-single-events","name":"Christian Single Events","id":63228},{"urlkey":"christian-dating-and-relationships","name":"Christian Dating and Relationships","id":72415},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-and-singles-again","name":"Christian Singles and Singles Again","id":103825},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-social-networking","name":"Christian Singles Social Networking","id":151244}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DMV-Single-Christian-Ladies-Network\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Calling all Single Christian Ladies! \"As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend\" (Proverbs 27:17)...

Stay mentally sharp! Have fun! Meet new people with a common goal! Stop being a chair potato as social events! Learn the line dances without judgement nor stress. Line dancing regularly and some knee pains and aching muscles may go away, too. Beginners are especially invited to the class and of course, more advanced dancers, too. No one knows all of the line dances but hoofers will learn so many of them. Train and learn with an experienced dancer, experienced line dancer and choreographer of ten years. Learning popular line dance songs in class and practicing at home improves the heart rate, can help breathing, &nbsp;does improve concentration, is very social, can make you sweat which is good for the skin, and is great all around exercise. The home practice is great,also, because practice makes perfect. The class is held only one hour a week, right now, and you do not want to forget what you learn from week to week. The class is not just for women but for men, too. When you learn that new dance that you have seen, you begin to feel good about yourself, &nbsp;boosting self-esteem a bit so smile. &nbsp; You should begin to dance because you feel it and soon will learn not to dance to the steps of the dance but to the you in you. Your feet will know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>In the class, hoofers will learn to pivot, slide, step and more. All a hoofer really needs to know is how to count from 1 to4 and 5 to 8 and, as someone said, left from right.<\/p>\n<p>For the class, no equipment is needed. Comfortable shoes are a must,...flats, dance shoes or heels. To provide easier spins and pivots and to use shoes on most types of floors, having suede soles on regular shoes is a good idea. One other suggestion is that a towel might come in handy since some dances, like cardio aerobics, can be real workouts. You see, adding to the advantages of line dancing above, line dancing does increase the heart rate, can improve breathing, can remove pain from sore joints, does increase blood flow and can improve memory. The &nbsp;more you dance, the more you feel and see the many results. The class is only one hour with the possibility of extending to 2 hours. &nbsp;The class session is $5.00 and will not change is the extends to 2 hours.<\/p>","lon":-76.7399978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192743006,"name":"Elner","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/highres_252282371.jpeg","photo_id":252282371,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/member_252282371.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/5\/8\/3\/thumb_252282371.jpeg"}},"members":184,"name":"DANCE-B HEALTHY 4 LIFE","id":19230177,"state":"MD","urlname":"DANCE-B-HEALTHY-4-LIFE","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":39.3300018311,"who":"Hoofers, Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450787903000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"stand-up-paddle-boarding","name":"Stand Up Paddle Boarding","id":18488}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/mocosup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Discover places to SUP in and around Montgomery County Maryland.

The structure of our meetings will be guided by our membership (especially at the first meeting), but will likely include educating ourselves more on how Universal Basic Income could be implemented, as well as figuring out strategies to help inform both the public and elected officials about the practical and ethical need for such a program.\n\nDoes this sound pie-in-the-sky? It's doable! The Nixon administration got a UBI bill all the way to Congress. The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is conducting a UBI experiment in 2016 (and experiments were done previously in a few cities around the world, including in the US and Canada).

I think making positive change\/holistic influence is attainable--it would take a lot of consideration and cooperation. It would take a motivated community of people who cared about the souls of these animals and who aim to see them live their truths and exist in allignment with their natures, as much as is possible at this time on this Earth. If there are people in the DMV area who are interested in coming together as a group of people, with the intentions of sending love, Reiki, light, gratitude, healing, etc to these souls in a concentrated way, I believe it could make an impact!

For folks 30 and older, one big challenge is just finding like-minded people, which is why I started this group. This is an opportunity to study independently, while in the same place (or boat), an empowering type of 'peer pressure.' I'll find good study spots -- primarily in Montgomery County, e.g., Silver Spring, Takoma Park, Bethesda. Each meetup will begin with introductions, then a timed independent study period of about 1.5 hours.

We believe in the concept of iron sharpening iron. If you have information on how to live non-toxic, we need your input. We will be meeting at our house, which is in a condition that my family can tolerate, but we will take any suggestions you have on how to make it better. If anyone else is willing to host, your house gets a free inspection from other \"sensitives.\" It is a win-win situation. :-) Why we're starting this group: It is proven psychologically that helping others helps you help yourself. We believe in this wholeheartedly. Anne Frank said, \"No one has ever become poor by giving.\" Here is an article about how this works scientifically: http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/communication\/why-helping-others-actually-helps-yourself.html We understand that some people are in a position where they feel they can't help anyone. Trust us, we've been there. Let us help you so that you can help others. The horrors of this condition have given us the tools to help those in need who are struggling now. Join in this chain of caring, so that your suffering isn't for nothing! There is meaning behind all of this, we are certain!","lon":-76.4499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197919866,"name":"Rob Dahl","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/e\/f\/highres_252780495.jpeg","photo_id":252780495,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/e\/f\/member_252780495.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/e\/f\/thumb_252780495.jpeg"}},"members":12,"name":"Mold, EMF, and Chemical Sensitivity Support Group","id":19316189,"state":"MD","urlname":"Mold-EMF-and-Chemical-Sensitivity-Support-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.4000015259,"who":"Non-Toxies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Elkridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452463039000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hiking","name":"Hiking","id":638},{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"outdoor-games","name":"Outdoor Games","id":56896},{"urlkey":"local-activities","name":"Local Activities","id":64867},{"urlkey":"hiking-all-levels-welcome","name":"Hiking, All Levels Welcome","id":89780}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Weekend-Friend-And-Fun\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This meet up is for people who have recently moved to the Baltimore area and are seeking to build a community in their late twenties, thirties, and early forties.

We\u2019ll get together and explore our world, well at least around the Baltimore area for the most part. Let's do affordable activities in our neighborhoods like going to events at the libraries, having outings at local parks, festivals and much more. We\u2019ll support each other with resources, support in strengthening our families and the Baltimore community overall. We will also have events for just the mama's, the papa's and anything else that is fun and supportive. This family oriented group is inclusive, meaning if you are: a parent that is single, separated, married, divorced or widowed, have either typically or non-typically developing children, a hetero or homosexual parent family, a younger or older parent, a co-parenting family, a step-family, a grandparent family, an adoptive family, a multicultural family, a multiracial family, a working family, a stay-at-home-parent, parent of kids of any ages and so on, you are very welcome here with no judgement! As long as you are a family, which here consists of parents with children under 18, you are welcome here. Just a few notes... privacy is very important and protecting families is as well. With that said, please: * If only for this meetup group, have your family in your profile photo that is up to date so we can assure you are a family and not a poser trying to lure anyone; * RSVP correctly as planning is important and numbers matter; * Yes - things happen, especially with children but if you say you're attending an event, please do so or change your RSVP even if at the last minute and\/or put a comment in the meetup event comment section; * If you or your child is sick, please stay home; * Be friendly and open minded about other families as you would have them to be about you and your family; * No soliciting unless the event calls for it or its asked for; * Dues are not for the organizer(s) but for the group\/events\/meeting spaces\/etc.; * Enjoy yourself and welcome!

The charter was written in 1980 and the Fells Point Yacht Club, Inc. was underway. During that first year, 32 charter members wrestled with our first set of By-Laws in front of the fireplace at the Oyster. A contest was held for the best burgee design. The entries decorated the walls of the Oyster for a few weeks before the our current design was chosen. We elected the original group of officers one at a time, and our fleet consisted of 7 sloops, 1 power boat, 1 catamaran, 1 trimaran and one tug boat. Early meetings took place on the 1st Tuesday of the month at the Oyster, and consisted of ten to twenty members sharing pitchers of beer. Our rendezvous were totally spontaneous, and a raft-up consisted of 2 or 3 boats laden with supplies and members. Dues were $10 or $15 which paid for postage and stationary. Aside from the patrons at the Oyster, very few people knew that FPYC existed. But, WE knew who were, and it was quickly decided that we would do things a bit differently than most other yacht clubs. Among other things, we decided our officers could be men or women, there would be no ladies auxiliary for us! We also decided to involve ourselves in the community - not isolate it from us OR us from it! Our first \u201corganized\u201d event was for children. It was a tug boat ride, nick-named the \u201cPumpkin Cruise,\u201d for children in the local community. In time, many of the charter members classified as \u201ccrew\u201d (non-boat owners) became captains of their own vessels, and our ranks swelled. Rumors about \u2018That Yacht Club at the Oyster\u2019 brought more members to FPYC, by 1983-84 our membership had doubled. We were sadly becoming too large for the Whistling Oyster. The Waterfront Hotel on Thames Street became our next home, and by 1986, we counted 48 boats, a full voting membership of 100, 20 junior members and a group of associate members. A few years later we rented ideal office space on Wolfe Street. We were excited; we had our very own club-house - with parking! Unfortunately, this independence was short lived. At one time, over 50% of our boat owners (including \u201clive-aboards\u201d) occupied a number of B-pier slips at Henderson\u2019s. Throughout the years we have actively run or participated in the Baltimore Parade of Lighted Boats, Inc., the Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race, the Baltimore City Fair, Port Fest, Harbor Expo, Fells Point Fun Festival, , , and the Whitbread Round The World Race for the Volvo Trophy. In cooperation with OP Sail (now Sail Baltimore) we have entertained and greeted visiting foreign and U.S. vessels. Hundreds of ships and their sailors have enjoyed our special brand of hospitality. Our welcoming \u201cDock Parties\u201d, held on B-pier, have entertained (and fed) upwards of 70 visiting sailors at one time! Additionally, we provide transportation, tours, and guided shopping for the sailors. Our community commitment continues to grow. FPYC members are constantly finding new ways to become involved with the Fells Point community, and we earmark a percentage of our yearly fund raisers to benefit a local charity, which we choose annually. The goals and philosophy first set forth by the original members of the Fells Point Yacht Club remain today. Social camaraderie, a love of boating, water safety education, philanthropy and a desire to help others, have become our driving covenant. The Fells Point Yacht Club is proud of the positive reputation we have earned in our tiny corner of Baltimore City - Historic Fells Point.","lon":-76.6399993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":74642272,"name":"Paul Brown","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/6\/highres_142322742.jpeg","photo_id":142322742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/6\/member_142322742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/6\/thumb_142322742.jpeg"}},"members":100,"name":"Fells Point Yacht Club","id":19339994,"state":"MD","urlname":"Fells-Point-Yacht-Club","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":39.3499984741,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Lutherville Timonium","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452816725000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"wine-lovers","name":"Wine Lovers","id":15634},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"exploring-new-restaurants","name":"Exploring New Restaurants","id":20704},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916},{"urlkey":"singles-who-love-to-travel-travel","name":"Singles Who Love to Travel Travel","id":64816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/21093-professional-singles-age-45-60-social-club\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This club is for professional, educated straight singles strictly age 45 -60 years old who live within 15 miles of 21093 zip and who<span>&nbsp;are interested in just connecting&nbsp;&nbsp;with other \"like\" singles ( educated , professional, with kids) to hang out with and try interesting places. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pls adhere to the distance rule, be in a professional career or trade, have a college education and be a parent.

Inspired by contemporary progressive Buddhism and the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh, we enjoy eating a simple mindful (potluck) meal together, mindful meditation (sitting and slow silent walking meditation), and sharing (sharing ideas, experiences, or concerns mindfully). We are all beginners in the practice, so beginners are most certainly welcome, as are people from all faith traditions. We meet on Friday evenings to relax and center after the week. We shut off our phones and are present and thankful for the present moment. For our Jewish friends, our gathering can be the beginning of your Shabbat observance (my partner is Jewish).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What do we do when you meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh, we enjoy silent eating, sitting and walking meditation, and sharing:<\/p>\n<p>6:30-7:30PM: <b>Simple Potluck meal <\/b>- eating silently and joyfully, cleaning up\/washing dishes mindfully<\/p>\n<p>7:30-8:30PM: <b>Introductions, Short reading, and Mindfulness Meditation<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>15 minute sitting meditation (or for those who cannot sit, please stand or lie down on your back comfortably)<\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n <p>15 minute walking meditation (one breath per step, walking in a circle slowly)<\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote> \n <p>15 minute sitting meditation (as before)<\/p> \n<\/blockquote>\n<p>8:30-9PM: <b>Sharing<\/b> - we practice deep listening and listen to anyone who wishes to share. We do not respond, but just listen &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What is mindfulness?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Paying attention to and being happy in the present moment. &nbsp;Being aware of your breath. &nbsp;Taking time to enjoy the present, instead of focusing on the past or the future. &nbsp;Quieting your thoughts and feelings - noticing them and letting them go.<\/p>\n<p><b>Is mindfulness sitting down in a meditation position?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Certainly being still can support the practice of being mindful, but we can also be mindful eating (noticing each piece of food), washing dishes, walking, etc. In this group we practice mindful eating together (awareness of the food, silence) as well as mindful sitting, walking, and listening. See below for additional resources on mindfulness\/meditation practice.<\/p>\n<p><b>How is being mindful in a group different than practicing this alone?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In Buddhism, the \"Sangha\" is the community that comes together to practice mindfulness and support one another. For many of us who wish to increase mindfulness in our lives, the support of a community is very helpful. There is a different experience when you are meditating with others - some of us find it easier. We can also support one another in our mindfulness practice and our skills mindfully responding to the world and life's challenges.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I'm totally new to this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This is a very easy practice, and you get the hang of it just by jumping in. You might wish to look at the resources below to learn a bit more (link and\/or book).<\/p>\n<p><b>What if I'm not Buddhist? I'm Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Atheist, etc.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Many people who practice mindfulness are from other faith traditions. This is about practice, not specific belief, so you do not need to check your faith (or non-faith) at the door.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Who is welcome?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Everyone, regardless of creed, culture, age, sexual orientation, gender, and any other form of human diversity.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why another mindfulness group? Aren't there enough in Maryland? Why through Meetup?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My partner and I are part of a wonderful mindfulness group in Maryland, but were not been able to find a group close to home - Northern Silver Spring (Colesville, Wheaton, White Oak, 4 Corners, Cloverly). Driving 25 minutes to Downtown Silver Spring or Columbia is challenging; this group builds a community in our own neighborhoods. We also value the deeper connections possible through sharing a meal together. As for using Meetup, Meetup has a wonderful tradition - founded following 9\/11 to bring communities together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Are there resources for getting started with

The group is intended to be a social event as well as group games from 2 players to 10 players depending on the plan for the day.<\/p>\n<p>Veteran \/ Military:<\/p>\n<p>Annapolis Region Gaming Conclave has an additional focus, which is to bring military and military family members together to share experiences, entertain and provide support.&nbsp; Many members of the Conclave are prior military.&nbsp;&nbsp; The group maintains a core group of current and prior military members which can provides a service for transitioning from military into private citizenship.<\/p>\n<p> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br><\/p>\n<p>Game Days<\/p>\n<p>The group&nbsp;runs sessions generally on a Saturday, but with special events planned as folks have time\/availability.&nbsp; As&nbsp;some of these game types will be strategy and will run from 30 min to several hours to play participants should come and be flexible on leaving times for the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The games that are up for play are just about anything that you wish to bring to the group.&nbsp; This said, there will be theme days that will be announced ahead of time to allow the teams \/ members to experience different types of games out there.&nbsp; For Open Play Days games could even include chess if you are interested in this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The organizers \/ hosts will&nbsp;setup as many tables \/ areas as we can fit into the spaces to accommodate folks' needs, but in all these events space is limited so restrictions on&nbsp;the number to 12-15 people on these sessions.<\/p>\n<p>The intent of these sessions is to play games that are fun, strategic and may take some thought.&nbsp; Party games&nbsp;and RPG style games are not going to be in the mix as the timeframe or intent of those games are usually for other types of groups.&nbsp; So, no Apples to Apples, no D&amp;D, no Magic the Gathering or other games of these types.&nbsp; If we do get into a deck builder the group generally&nbsp;proposes that any deck builder game is limited in distribution and something that is more unique.&nbsp; Something like Doomtown would be a good pick as it does not fit the bill of a widely distributed advertised deck builder and has a bit more complexity to it.<\/p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>Texas Hold 'Em<\/p>\n<p>We may alternate the sessions between poker and board games.&nbsp; One of the leadership group runs a Texas Hold 'Em tournament style game from time to time with all the equipment (table, good cards, chips, etc.).&nbsp; The rules of the tournament style play is that it is $5 buy-in for $1000 in chips.&nbsp; During these sessions, the rounds starting with a $5\/$10 ante and progressively double it every 15 min.&nbsp;&nbsp; We run the rounds until there is a winner and the winner splits the pot with the second place person 2\/3 to 1\/3 (or whatever rounds up to the nearest $5 bill).&nbsp; You only need to bring a stack of $5's for this session.&nbsp; Also, the rounds when there are about four or more players lasts about 1 1\/2 to 2 hours.&nbsp; So in all reality this is about playing poker and having fun learning play styles.&nbsp; Hey, maybe you can take your skills from these sessions and see how you do at the casino and win big.<\/p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p>Space is limited for these sessions as there are&nbsp;two table options that would accommodate this type of play.&nbsp; So we have to&nbsp;limit the sessions initially to no more than eight players.&nbsp; Folks that want to come and watch are certainly welcome but generally we will&nbsp;split that group into a session running&nbsp;at the same time if&nbsp;the group has enough participants during the event.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>RSVP is required for all events.&nbsp; If you don't RSVP then we are assuming you are not coming, but this said if you RSVP \"Not Coming\" that would be awesome so we know that you are still an active member but just not coming to this particular event.<\/p>\n<p>Plans for the games played will be determined based on the group's interest for each planned event.<\/p>\n<p>All events are bring your own snacks and drinks, but with the intent that you would bring a snack to share with folks.<\/p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p> Parking Locations:<\/p>\n<p>Home Plate Location:&nbsp;&nbsp; For this location&nbsp;there of&nbsp;course is street parking. Like any other neighborhood this location has&nbsp;a couple of neighbors who heavily use the front of their house as they have multiple cars. Meaning if you park in front of their house they fuss. The house next to the location up the street\/hill and the one directly across. So on that note:<\/p>\n<p>- You can park in front of the house and you can even block the driveway. <br>- Don't park in front of the mailbox though <br>- Don't park in&nbsp;the house&nbsp;next to the location \/ up the street, or across the street&nbsp; <br>- Do park anywhere else on the street; The rest of the street is fair game.<\/p>\n<p> Outfield Location: &nbsp;This is an apartment complex with some restrictions on guest parking. On-street parking is fair game. If parking in the lot, please let the organizer know as soon as you get here so we can give you a parking pass to put in your car. Parking passes are limited, so the more you can use street parking the better. If parking between the hours of 6 am and 4 pm, any parking is fine. Parking in the lot is only restricted between 4 pm and 6 am. You will get towed. Please let me know if you need a pass. (I will try to supply passes for as many RSVPs as we have, so RSVP-ing is appreciated.)<\/p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Member Profiles:<\/p>\n<p>Members that do not signup with a real name and\/or real photo on their profile will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be removed from the group.&nbsp; We generally like to play with real people ....

We host meet-ups several times per month, with our kids at parks, playgrounds, museums, sporting events, parent-and-me classes, and anywhere else we feel compelled within the Baltimore, Marlyand metropolitan area. We also host Dads Nights Out to give our members an opportunity to socialize, have fun, learn, and support each other as we navigate parenthood. We are a group with dads of all stripes: married dads, single dads, dads who share custody, adoptive dads, step dads, stay at home dads, full time working dads, work from home dads, freelance dads, etc. Our meet-ups occur both during the week and on weekends to accommodate both stay at home dads and working dads. We welcome all involved fathers in and around the Baltimore metro area who want to socialize and interact with other guys who enjoy spending quality time with their children. The only requirement to joining us is to be a dad. There are no group dues and no attendance expectations. We have some dads who come consistently to most of we do, and we have some dads who might only come out once or twice per year. We\u2019re here for all dads whenever they are ready to come out. Through our blog and social media channels, we offer parenting resources, local guides, and give our members the opportunity to connect online in-between meet ups. Via our parent organization, City Dads Group, we offer occasional sponsored events in which our members and their families gain access to free experiences, educational workshops, free product demos, and prizes from brands.

The goal is to connect, network, brainstorm, collaborate and perform with other aspiring local talent and possibly even make some real pieces happen! Looking forward to meeting everyone and seeing what we can accomplish by bringing our talents together!<\/p>","lon":-76.6399993896,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/6\/c\/highres_447495212.jpeg","photo_id":447495212,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/6\/c\/600_447495212.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/b\/6\/c\/thumb_447495212.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11829267,"name":"Tracey Wells-Morris","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/c\/b\/highres_254470699.jpeg","photo_id":254470699,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/c\/b\/member_254470699.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/9\/c\/b\/thumb_254470699.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Baltimore Thespian Society","id":19664420,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Thespian-Society","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":39.3100013733,"who":"B-more Thespians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Reisterstown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457155750000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"vietnamese-buddhist-meditation","name":"Vietnamese Buddhist Meditation","id":17906},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"transformation","name":"Transformation","id":21591},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"buddhism-zen-taoism-alan-watts","name":"Buddhism, Zen, Taoism, Alan Watts","id":29293},{"urlkey":"buddha","name":"Buddha","id":69664},{"urlkey":"buddhist","name":"Buddhist","id":128602}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jeta-Grove-Meditation-Community-Meet-up\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Jeta Grove Meditation Community is a growing group of people of all ages and backgrounds, coming together to enjoy the benefits of meditating with a group.

The meditation lasts one hour. During about the first 15 minutes, we will listen to a Dhamma talk by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, an American monk and the abbot of the Metta Forest Monastery in California. Theravada Buddhism is the oldest of the Buddhist religions and the one most geared to the teachings of the historical Buddha.&nbsp; More particularly, we are students of the Thai Forest Tradition.&nbsp; The most common instruction the Buddha gave was to do \"jhana practice,\" i.e. to learn to concentrate the mind. Sometimes you will hear teachers say to first do concentration practice and then do \"insight\" practice, but the Buddha never made that distinction. Indeed, as you learn to concentrate them mind, you necessarily have to develop insight and discernment. It is not necessary that you be a Theravada Buddhist to participate, but you do need to be able to maintain silence during the meditation period. Meditation instruction is provided for those who desire it as well as free books. After the meditation there will be an opportunity for conversation, tea, and&nbsp; potluck snacks.&nbsp; There is no charge. While we have a donation basket, there is no pressure to make a donation. Since we meet at the home of one of the organizers, a gentle screening takes place before he gives you his address. Contact the organizers in this regard. The two organizers, Walter and Lee, each have over 25 years of meditation experience.<\/p>","lon":-76.5699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":75697742,"name":"Walter","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/c\/f\/highres_254526863.jpeg","photo_id":254526863,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/c\/f\/member_254526863.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/c\/f\/thumb_254526863.jpeg"}},"members":44,"name":"Theravada Buddhist Meditation in North Baltimore County","id":19672003,"state":"MD","urlname":"Theravada-Buddhist-Meditation-in-North-Baltimore-County","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":39.5,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457308527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"homebuyer","name":"Home Buyers","id":6785},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"first-time-home-buyers","name":"First Time Home Buyers","id":19213},{"urlkey":"home-improvement","name":"Home Improvement","id":22171},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"interior-decorating","name":"Interior Decorating","id":46026},{"urlkey":"downsizing","name":"Downsizing","id":59408},{"urlkey":"home-renovation","name":"Home Renovation","id":75696}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DC-MD-Open-House-Walkers\/","rating":4,"description":"Curious about open houses and don't to go alone?

who are interested in chess variant games such as Giveway Chess and Scottish (Progressive) Chess.<\/p>\n<p>This is NOT your standard chess club where chess is played and studied. &nbsp;There are plenty of other groups that do that.<\/p>\n<p>We are those strange folk who like to solve the chess puzzles that you might see in the newspaper.<\/p>\n<p>We'll look at solving 2 move direct mate problems which often center around a theme. &nbsp;We'll also examine some 3 move (and longer) direct mate problems and possibly some end game studies (which is as close as we'll come to regular chess games).<\/p>\n<p>One of the main purposes is to study chess problems with a little twist. &nbsp;Some of them are helpmates (where black helps white mate him), selfmates (where white forces black to mate him) and will also look at some series mover problems such as as a series helpmate where black make x number of consecutive moves (the white pieces stay still) to reach a position where white can mate him with one move.<\/p>\n<p>Another feature of this meetup group is the introduction of a few chess variants games where the game of chess adopts a few different rules or objectives. &nbsp;One is \"Giveaway Chess\" where the object is to force your opponent to capture your pieces. &nbsp;The combatant who \"gives away\" all his pieces first is the winner.<\/p>\n<p>Another game we'll play is called \"Progressive\" or \"Scottish\" chess. &nbsp;White makes one move, black makes two consecutive moves, white make 3 consecutive moves, etc until one side is mated.<\/p>\n<p>I'm working on the rules for a new variant game that I'm inventing. &nbsp;More info on that to follow.<\/p>\n<p>We'll try a few face to face meetups, but we will probably do a lot of evening \"webinar\" type of meetings to reach a broader range of problemists.<\/p>\n<p>

The idea is that if you have too many of some kind of plant in your yard or perhaps a particular plant that you'd just rather not have altogether, you can post it to the group and offer it up to anyone who would like to come and dig it out and take it for their yard. Once you post a plant to offer to the group, you can also post a wishlist of plants which you would love to have in your yard and perhaps other members may respond with offers of those plants. It's kind of like \"Freecycle\" for plants. When we get a few members, we can perhaps set a monthly live plant swap\/picnic, where those who might be uncomfortable with a stranger coming to their home yard to dig up the plants, can bring their own plants which they'd like to swap with others and enjoy some social time, as well. I hope this forum will attract a few plant experts\/green thumbs to exchange planting\/dividing tips, etc., as well. In your intro, perhaps offer what types of plants you have available and perhaps your plant wishlist and your general location\/neighborhood. If there are multiple responses to an offering, each person offering their plants uses their own discretion as to which people they choose to come and get the plants. It may be that there are enough for more than one person, but again, it is entirely up to each person to decide who they allow to pick-up\/dig-up the plants and to oversee the process. The offerer and recipient will need to agree between themselves, who is responsible for filling in a hole left by the plant removal.","lon":-76.6800003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11525226,"name":"SueEllen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/2\/6\/highres_209154822.jpeg","photo_id":209154822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/2\/6\/member_209154822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/6\/2\/6\/thumb_209154822.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Baltimore Community Plant Swap","id":19753913,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-Community-Plant-Swap","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":39.3100013733,"who":"Gardening & Plant enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Gwynn Oak","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458876619000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"qigong","name":"Qi Gong","id":9857},{"urlkey":"cancer","name":"Cancer","id":10380},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"cancer-recovery","name":"Cancer Recovery","id":17532},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"mind-body-wellness","name":"Mind Body Wellness","id":26120},{"urlkey":"cancer-support-group","name":"Cancer Support Group","id":33425},{"urlkey":"cancer-survivors","name":"Cancer Survivors","id":34008},{"urlkey":"breast-cancer","name":"Breast Cancer","id":55479},{"urlkey":"breast-cancer-support","name":"Breast cancer support","id":92177}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MD-Cancer-Survivors-Caregivers-with-Self-Healing-Meetup\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., and we are far away from finding the cure for cancers at this moment.

Noel Events has been planning wedding and events for years and feels that it's time to start educating brides on how to eliminate some unwanted stress during the planning process.","lon":-76.7699966431,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197588790,"name":"Latika Noel","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/8\/0\/highres_252544736.jpeg","photo_id":252544736,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/8\/0\/member_252544736.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/2\/8\/0\/thumb_252544736.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Her Way Her Day Meetup","id":19766910,"state":"MD","urlname":"Her-Way-Her-Day-Meetup","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":39.4300003052,"who":"BTB's"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Silver Spring","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459178687000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"outdoor-adventures","name":"Outdoor Adventures","id":16967},{"urlkey":"adventure-travel","name":"Adventure Travel","id":18317},{"urlkey":"30s-and-40s","name":"30s and 40s","id":19133},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-and-40s","name":"Singles 30s and 40s","id":19134},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"singles-who-love-to-travel-travel","name":"Singles Who Love to Travel Travel","id":64816},{"urlkey":"solo-single-travelers-looking-for-group-to-travel","name":"Solo Travelers","id":1125102}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Travel-Planning-30s-and-40s-Social-Escapes\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>\u201cWe travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us.\u201d ~Anonymous <br><\/p>\n<p>See the Northern Lights in Iceland, ski in the Alps, cruise Alaska, or meditate in Bali. The world offers infinite opportunities for exploration. Let me help you achieve your travel dreams! (This group is a for-profit travel planning site)<br><\/p>\n<p>There are a few main reasons people do not travel: lack of funds, lack of travel buddies, lack of time to plan\u2026This group takes care of two big ones. First, let me take care of your basic travel plans\u2013I\u2019ll map out a daily itinerary for your trip based on information you give. Then, the event will be posted to meetup so that you can find like-minded travel buddies. <br><\/p>\n<p>How this works: You are one of two people: a Trip Leader or just a Traveler <br><\/p>\n<p>Trip Leader: You will be the \"event host\" for the trip. In charge of working out the logistics with me then serving as the coordinator on the trip (since these are vacations I plan but will not attend). You will fill out a questionnaire so that I can learn what you want out of your trip. With the basic travel planning fee ($75 per travel day) I\u2019ll lay out a basic day-by-day plan for tours you can take, museums to visit, or off-the-beaten-path hikes, depending on your interests. Once the event is posted to meetup, you can charge each additional traveler to cover my planning fee. <br><\/p>\n<p>Traveler: You will sign up for a trip that someone else has commissioned, pay them part of my fee, and simply enjoy a great vacation. <br><\/p>\n<p>All booking will be up to the individual traveler. <br><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t know where to go? I can help you decide! Also, I\u2019ll post non-solicited trips to the group. A fee will be added to these to cover the time spent planning. This group will cover anything you can dream up. A long weekend camping in the Smokies, a quick overnight to NYC, or international travel. It\u2019s up to you! <br><\/p>\n<p>Group members are in their 30s and 40s. To join, please submit a photo, a short bio, and your top two travel destinations.<\/p>\n<p>About me: Most importantly, I\u2019m a travel lover. Sometimes that means an overnight camp trip at the local state park, sometimes that\u2019s two weeks bouncing around Europe. I haven\u2019t seen it all, but I\u2019d like to! For me, research is part of the fun of travel. So much so that as soon as I get back from one vacation, I start planning the next. I\u2019ve been running meetups groups for a few years now, so I\u2019ve quickly learned how to organize events so that most of the work is on me and the event itself is just fun and relaxed. <br><\/p>\n<br>","lon":-77.0400009155,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":55017162,"name":"Melissa","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/8\/0\/highres_131269792.jpeg","photo_id":131269792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/8\/0\/member_131269792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/8\/0\/thumb_131269792.jpeg"}},"members":90,"name":"Travel Planning - 30s and 40s Social Escapes","id":19767945,"state":"MD","urlname":"Travel-Planning-30s-and-40s-Social-Escapes","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":39,"who":"World Explorers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Annapolis","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459189372000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"makeup","name":"Makeup","id":1481},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"botox","name":"Botox","id":6076},{"urlkey":"plasticsurgery","name":"Plastic Surgery","id":6288},{"urlkey":"antiaging","name":"Anti-Aging","id":9862},{"urlkey":"cosmetic-fillers","name":"cosmetic fillers","id":18890},{"urlkey":"cosmetic-surgery","name":"Cosmetic Surgery","id":18891},{"urlkey":"women-beauty","name":"Women & Beauty","id":23642},{"urlkey":"injectable-and-fillers","name":"Injectable and Fillers","id":63180},{"urlkey":"beauty","name":"Beauty","id":63675},{"urlkey":"natural-beauty","name":"Natural Beauty","id":80386},{"urlkey":"cosmetic-procedures","name":"Cosmetic Procedures","id":88990},{"urlkey":"beauty-2-0","name":"Beauty 2.0","id":100507},{"urlkey":"beauty-and-wellness","name":"Beauty and Wellness","id":122008},{"urlkey":"learn-about-plastic-surgery-skin-care","name":"Learn about Plastic Surgery & Skin Care","id":140734}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Annapolis-Women-Beauty-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is for anyone interested in learning the latest in cosmetic plastic surgery, anti-aging, laser treatments, skin care, weight loss and over all wellness of your body.

My plan is to hike between 10 and 14 miles on Saturdays, starting on May 7th and finishing at the end of August (depending on how things work out). I'm not a trail runner nor am I looking to set any land speed records. I just thought it would be fun to get in some hiking (on admittedly pretty flat terrain) with a small group of folks with a similar interest (plus it helps when you start at point A, to have vehicles parked at point B to ferry people back to their cars at point A). If people are interested in only hiking portions of the trail that is fine too. I expect we'll have a moderate pace, take some restroom breaks and a lunch break, and have a good time.

We are looking to add about 5 new moms to our already existing \"book club\/dinner club\/we do what we want club\"! Okay, so let me explain! We started as a book club, but once we became too busy to keep up on a monthly book, we decided to switch to a dinner club\/whatever you want club. We meet the 1st Thursday of the month, and take turns hosting, when it is your turn to host, you can pick whatever theme you want. You plan the night and tell everyone else what to bring. We've done holiday themed nights, craft nights, lawn games, wine pairing, mimosas and manicures, etc... you pick whatever you want when you host! We started at 15 moms, and over the last couple years (3 years this October) we have lost 5 due to moves, so we are looking to rejuvenate our group with 5 fresh new faces!&nbsp;Here's what we are looking for:<\/p>\n<p>1) You're a mama just like us! Our kids range 6 and under.<\/p>\n<p>2) Between 30-40<\/p>\n<p>3) You like to drink!<\/p>\n<p>4) You're outgoing, you can walk into a group of people and not be shy<\/p>\n<p>5) You like to have fun and know how to joke around (nothing serious about our group, all fun)!<\/p>\n<p>6) You live near the Notthingham\/White Marsh area, or VERY close by!<\/p>\n<p>7) You are able to host at your house, it will be once a year, if not less, so easy!<\/p>\n<p>8) You can commit to attending the first Thursday of the month (unless there's a holiday we switch to another week, but always on Thursdays)<\/p>\n<p>9) You have Facebook. Our group is on there, we are just using Meetup to meet a few new members.<\/p>\n<p>The 10 of us currently together all met through Meetup almost 3 years ago, so I am hoping Meetup comes through for us once again with a few new fun mamas! If you are outgoing and like to have fun, you won't be disappointed you joined us!

Want to learn how to bring more visibility to your business online? More advanced and you're looking for the scoop on the latest in search engine marketing? Or just looking to get your questions answered about online marketing? Then the Annapolis Search Engine Optimization Meetup is for you. Whether you're a business owner in Annapolis, the marketing lead for your company, or even a solo entrepreneur, learning about search engine optimization can help you take advantage of the power of marketing online. SEO is different than any other type of marketing -- it is more targeted and customer-centric than any traditional form of advertising such as television, radio, and billboards, and it is WAY more effective. Every meeting, we're focused on one very specific, relevant, and hands-on topic every time (bring your laptops!) so that you can actually begin working on your own SEO right in the meetup. We'll be talking and working through topics such as: - Creating and ranking your own personal YouTube videos for your business - Creating citations via Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. so that when people search for your service, you pop up at the top - How to mobile optimize your website so that your website ranks higher on Google - Newest changes to Google's algorithm You'll be learning from a certified Google Partner and Local Guide who has hands-on experience working with CEOs and business owners in the DMV area rank their websites and videos.","lon":-76.5100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":121147142,"name":"John Victoria","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/d\/4\/highres_255490964.jpeg","photo_id":255490964,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/d\/4\/member_255490964.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/d\/4\/thumb_255490964.jpeg"}},"members":32,"name":"Annapolis Search Engine Optimization Meetup","id":19816728,"state":"MD","urlname":"Annapolis-Search-Engine-Optimization-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":39,"who":"SEO Experts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460140266000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"museum","name":"Museum","id":7319},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"ethnic-food","name":"Ethnic Food","id":15210},{"urlkey":"foreign-films","name":"Foreign Films","id":19665},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Washington-Arts-Culture-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Welcome to the Washington Arts &amp; Culture Meetup! <\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p>This is a group for anyone who enjoys meeting new friends, and sharing their love for Arts &amp; Culture of all kinds - including Art Galleries, Cultural Activities, Museums, Live Music, Social Dancing, Foreign Films, Travel, Ethnic Food and more!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We do MEMBER-hosted outings all over the DMV to share our favorite activities and events.&nbsp;This can be everything from museum visits and art exhibits to live performances and discovering new cuisine. <br><\/p>\n<p>I started this group to meet other art and culture enthusiasts, and to be introduced to fun activities and events that YOU enjoy!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This group is MEMBER-driven and MEMBER-hosted! <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ALL EVENTS ARE TO COME FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR MEMBERS!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this Meetup is for YOU to share your cultural and arts interests with our group.

Love to explore? Runsploring is the ultimate combination. This group is aimed at staying active, having fun, being social, and exploring the hidden gems of Northern DC and Silver Spring.<\/p>\n<p>Although we like to get a workout, Runsploring is a laid back activity and we don't take ourselves too seriously. As a Runsplorer, we pick a starting location and route. Then we run at a comfortable pace and stop if we come across an amazing view, landmark, or anything else that sparks our interest. The ultimate goal is to have fun while staying in shape. We will be hosting weekly Runventures (Run adventures) in Northern DC and\/or Silver Spring. Join the group to meet up for Runventures and to share your favorite.<\/p>\n<p><span>Runventure routes.

Q\/A:<\/p>\n<p>How long are our runs?<\/p>\n<p>Runs are usually between 30 minutes and 1 hour, but you can make it shorter or longer based on your running level.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How far do we run?<\/p>\n<p>You can run as far as you want, but they are usually around 3 to 4 miles. If there are a lot of people and different running levels, we can split up into groups of different abilities.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How fast do we run?<\/p>\n<p>We have members who are fast and slow. This is not a race, you should run at a comfortable pace and enjoy yourself. That being said, we will be running, not walking.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 What do I need?<\/p>\n<p>You need running shoes and a good spirit.

You can choose if you want to run when there is bad weather. If there is weather so bad that it is not safe to run (i.e.: hurricane) the meetup will be canceled. You can check the meetup before you come.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Do we run in the dark? Yes.
