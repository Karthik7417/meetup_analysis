natural, instinctive movement which strengthens and restores the body, clarifies the mind, and provides a framework for healthy, safe, life-long activity\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the

Still very exciting!<\/p> <p>We have a new-old idea that leaps beyond the news hype and celebrates the wonder of the activity itself. Let's get together every Thursday evening to explore this broad field, in all of its many facets and manifestations. And get to know each other better -- from bold pioneers, to new adopters, from teachers to students, manufacturing experts, to code and electronics hackers. This is your space to grow and share.<\/p> <p>Topics we might explore on a typical Thursday evening include:<\/p> <p>- 3D design software and techniques. From getting started, to pushing boundaries.<\/p> <p>- Explore more of the 3D ecosystem, from making use of 3D printing service bureaus to starting and managing your 3D Hub.<\/p> <p>- How to prototype and develop your own physical products, tools, and artwork.<\/p> <p>- 3D printing materials: strategies for fabricating in more than just 1-2 plastics.<\/p> <p>- Casting and mold-making: from precious metals to candy bars.<\/p> <p>- Finishing techniques. Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing.... Why just make things that look like plastic?<\/p> <p>Let's spend time together sorting out better ways to use these tools, and better ways to design.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/3DThursday\/events\/231176068\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":9000000,"name":"How to monetize your 3D printing hobby!","id":"231176068","time":1463698800000,"updated":1463709582000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1358802733000,"name":"3D Thursdays! 3D Printing and Hacking","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":6773682,"urlname":"3DThursday","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"3D Printing Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"322 East 6th Street between 1st and 2nd","name":"Raj Mahal","lon":-74.005943,"id":24202939,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459915140000,"fee":{"amount":35,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This event is being sponsored by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksocialnetwork.com\/\">The New York Social Network<\/a>\u00a0and their partner Meet Up groups.\u00a0 The number of RSVP's below reflect only a portion of those attending.

Effective altruism is about recognizing the importance of using our lives to do the most good we can and looking for ways to help others that are high-impact and well-supported by evidence. This approach may sound obvious, but careful consideration of the impact of different strategies for doing good can lead to some surprising, and even controversial, conclusions. Ethical philosophy, career strategies, economics, and persuasion methods play important roles in these considerations, so EA attracts smart people and provides intellectually invigorating topics of discussion.<\/p> <p>A great way to start learning about our perspective is to watch Peter Singer's TED talk:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>If it piques your interest, have a look through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/effective-altruism.com\/ea\/6x\/introduction_to_effective_altruism\/\">introductory links on the Effective Altruism Forum<\/a>,\u00a0or read Will MacAskill's excellent book on the topic,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.com\/\">Doing Good Better<\/a>\u00a0-- and\u00a0let us know what you think!<\/p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more.

Sanding, painting, sealing, melting, deforming, decorating, hydro-printing....

There is no rush and no pressure: The Toastmasters program allows you to progress at your own pace.<\/p> <p>Constructive evaluation is central to the Toastmasters philosophy.

You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations.

We're very excited to officially announce the premier trip of our new project, SHVILEI OLAM. We would love to hear your thoughts, and, if you're free the weekend of May 20-22, apply and join us! Please pass this along to anyone who might be interested.<\/p> <p>WHEN: May 20-22, 2016 - Leaving 7am from Temple Beth Shalom, Cambridge and driving up to the White Mountains in New Hampshire.<\/p> <p>WHAT: A new organization, SHVILEI OLAM, is hosting a Backcountry Shabbaton. We are currently accepting applications from 20s\/30s interested in experiencing the celebration of a traditional Shabbat in the woods. We'll be learning backpacking skills, building our own halakhic eruv, identifying stars, dabbling in the spiritual practice of hitboddetut, and much more!<\/p> <p>WHO WE ARE: We are Eli Witkin and Carrie Watkins, two observant adventurers with a mission of enhancing Jewish practices through nature. We built this one of a kind Shabbaton to help others learn basic outdoor skills, and, in doing so, gain a deeper appreciation of our tradition. It is our hope that participants will walk away from the program with an enhanced connection with the natural world and illuminated understanding of the context from which many of our Shabbat observances stem.<\/p> <p>HOW MUCH: This trip is funded by a generous grant from the CJP and co-sponsored by Temple Beth Shalom of Cambridge. While participants are required to bring some supplies (comprehensive packing list will be provided), the cost of the trip is FREE. Please complete your application no later than APRIL 15<\/p> <p>QUESTIONS: email [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jewish-Outdoors-Club\/events\/230019331\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":183600000,"name":"Camping Shabaton in the Woods!","id":"230019331","time":1463742000000,"updated":1463927208000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1380727221000,"name":"The Jewish Outdoors Club","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":10521162,"urlname":"Jewish-Outdoors-Club","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"JOCers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10704","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Yonkers","address_1":"833 Yonkers Avenue","name":"Raceway Diner","lon":-73.861801,"id":9922042,"state":"NY","lat":40.920681,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.5916194916,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1412342345000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Achievers-Network-Chapter-of-BNI-Professional-Networking\/events\/228178839\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Come and meet our group members and find out how you can get more business.","id":"dprwskyvhbbc","time":1463742000000,"updated":1463753503000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411656123000,"name":"Achiever's Network Chapter of BNI - Professional Networking","group_lon":-73.8899993896,"id":17206422,"urlname":"Achievers-Network-Chapter-of-BNI-Professional-Networking","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"685 Third Avenue","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.973328,"id":23833317,"state":"NY","lat":40.751579,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.881249666214,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432179007000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>-NEW MEMBER WELCOME-<\/p> <p>\uff08\u203bThis event is for those who want to study Japanese and who want to teach Japanese. \u00a0NOT for Japanese who want to study English\uff09<\/p> <p>Come seize the day with us over a cup of coffee, a danish, and Japanese conversation at our early morning events!<\/p> <p>These casual gatherings are open for all levels of Japanese.

Whether you\u2019re in an ideation session, cranking on prototypes, or taking notes during a meeting, being comfortable with a marker in your hand is a skill that will help you become a better design thinker. Regardless of your role in your organization or on a project, being able to define concepts through visuals is a valuable skill that can help boost your creativity.<\/p> <p>In this workshop you will take your visual skills to the next level through activities and practice with tools and methods for sketch noting, visual facilitation, and conveying meaning with simple icons and shapes.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/eventlogos\/38581182\/1visualvocabulary.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll cover four key categories of skills:<\/p> <p><br\/><i>1. VISUAL VOCABULARY<\/i><\/p> <p>In language we use the alphabet, in visualization there are basic forms to sketch representing people, places, actions or how time has lapsed. Having a larger visual vocabulary means not having to think about what you\u2019re drawing, but focusing on what you want to convey.<\/p> <p><i>2. PROCESS MAPPING<\/i><\/p> <p>When we\u2019re conveying ideas, the small concepts mentioned above add up to make a story. This story could tell how produce moves from the farm to our table or how cash flows through an organization. Understanding how to put the small pieces together to paint a grander picture is important for systems thinking and strategy.<\/p> <p><i>3. FRAMEWORKS<\/i><\/p> <p>Flowcharts, pyramid diagrams, bulls-eyes, journey maps\u2026there\u2019s no reason to reinvent the wheel when so many frameworks already exist. Having a good understanding of each type of visual framework and what it does will help you quickly express ideas for yourself and to your team.<\/p> <p><i>4. SUMMARIZING AND PRESENTING DATA<\/i><\/p> <p>As we start to build confidence in our visual vocabulary, mapping abilities, and have multiple frameworks to choose from, we can now start putting all of these components together. We\u2019ll integrate quantitative and qualitative data into our sketches to sell an idea that helps move an audience to action.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Design-Gym-New-York-City\/events\/231000605\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":28800000,"name":"Visual Skills for Design Thinking","id":"231000605","time":1463751000000,"updated":1463780497000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1413907282000,"name":"The Design Gym New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":17769772,"urlname":"The-Design-Gym-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Community Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"186 W. 4th St","name":"The Coffee Foundry","lon":-74.002075,"id":1536258,"state":"NY","lat":40.732704,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.35478806496,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434089690000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Fam!<\/p> <p><br\/>This week we have the pleasure of having Kat Vorotova of Try the World coming by to share her journey.<\/p> <p>Try\u00a0The\u00a0World\u00a0is a global online marketplace for authentic products from around\u00a0the\u00a0world.

If so, ask yourself why. Caving is not a spectator sport, and it tends to be cold and muddy. Tight passages and long crawls are not uncommon. Dangers include falling down pits, being crushed by falling rocks, drowning, and hypothermia. And then there is the possibility of getting lost and quickly dying of hypothermia or slowly starving to death. But for people trained to cave safely, the rewards are worth the misery and risks.<\/p> <p>Still interested? Good! Doesn't sound like fun? That's ok, come along for car camping at Thompson's Lake Campground at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysparks.com\/parks\/128\/details.aspx\">Thatcher State Park<\/a>.

This profound body of work releases trauma and numbness held in the body and allows us to open to ecstatic orgasmic pleasure and deep emotional connection. It brings increased consciousness to all levels of our being: physical, sexual, relational, emotional, mental, spiritual and energetic. Sexual practices awaken and connect neural circuitry between erogenous zones and the brain, increasing the capacity to feel expanded pleasure throughout the body, have more powerful, longer orgasms and become multi-orgasmic. Men can learn powerful techniques to both delay ejaculation and expand their range of pleasure.<\/p> <p>Emotionally this work opens one up to expanded states of bliss, connection, reverence and ecstatic joy and union.<\/p> <p>Register Now:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/potentize-use-tantric-energy-for-healing-awakening-tickets-25042732487\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/potentize-use-tantric-energy-for-healing-awakening-tickets-25042732487\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/potentize-use-tantric-energy-for-healing-awakening-tickets-25042732487<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>We are honored and privileged to both:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Facilitate this healing and awakening journey for individuals and couples in our private practice, and<\/p> <p>\u2022 We're Organizers for Tantra The Art of Conscious Loving Beginner Weekend Seminar with Tantra Master Charles Muir in New York City, October 21-23<\/p> <p>This evening workshop will be an introduction to the principles and methods of this body of work.

So the first D&amp;D group pointed us in the right direction. So here is what you need to know about this meetup:<\/p> <p>-Limited number of spots, and spot priority does go to the people who attended the first meeting.<br\/>-It is okay if you have no experience with D&amp;D, in fact most people playing are new to it.<br\/>-If you are interested in being part of this D&amp;D group, understand that this meetup is MANDATORY. You also must arrive by 8pm-which is when game play officially starts.<br\/>-Game play for this session is about character building and if we have time start a simple quest.<\/p> <p>\u00a0For those who are serious about this D&amp;D group I encourage you to read\/flip through the player's basic rules: <a href=\"http:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/products\/tabletop\/players-basic-rules\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/products\/tabletop\/players-basic-rules<\/a><\/p> <p>and if you are interested in the role of dungeon master, check out: <a href=\"http:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/products\/tabletop\/dm-basic-rules\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/products\/tabletop\/dm-basic-rules<\/a><\/p> <p>We are currently looking for some campaigns as well. But i figured these two links will get everyone introduced to the main concepts. Any questions, comments or concerns please reach out.<\/p> <p><br\/>**Update**<\/p> <p>1. Please bring pen and paper to build your character.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. I will have some snacks here: Potato chips, and two litters of soda (one coke and one sprite). Feel free to bring snacks.\u00a0<\/p> <p>3. Please subside from side conversations once the game play has started. It is distracting and makes it harder to hear the speaker.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Geeksters\/events\/231111563\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Dungeons and Dragons","id":"231111563","time":1463785200000,"updated":1463851985000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1453161141000,"name":"Geeks United (Queens+)","group_lon":-73.7799987793,"id":19362680,"urlname":"Geeksters","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Geeksters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Wayne","address_1":"170 Colfax Rd","name":"Wayne Racquet Club","lon":-74.265884,"id":19966552,"lat":40.977711,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.3823680878,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462544384000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for tennis &amp; snacks (BYOB).<\/p> <p>Doubles &amp; Mixed Doubles.<\/p> <p>INTERMEDIATE - ADVANCED PLAYERS<\/p> <p>$12.00\/player \u00a0 \u00a0 ($5\/WRC members)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/7\/a\/600_438172346.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"www.waynetennis.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Wayne-Tennis-Meetup-Group\/events\/230924837\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":10800000,"name":"TENNIS:  FRIDAY NITE UNDER THE LIGHTS!!!","id":"dhgdtlyvhbbc","time":1463785200000,"updated":1463797552000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1399583117000,"name":"The Wayne Tennis Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.25,"id":14342912,"urlname":"The-Wayne-Tennis-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07105","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Newark","address_1":"77 Ferry Street","name":"Mompou Tapas Bar & Lounge","lon":-74.161942,"id":14594812,"state":"NJ","lat":40.731396,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.11110973358,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461721802000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone, I'm going to be hosting this event at a great venue in North Jersey if anyone wants to join me:<\/p> <p>TGIF!

The third night of this four-night series will host two performances; \u201cBone Minus One\u201d by Angeli and \u201cNightmare in White\u201d by Emery Medina on May 20th, 2016 at Rabbithole Projects.<\/p> <p>\u201cBone Minus One\u201d is an ongoing performance that presents an interaction that happens amongst and with the audience. Angeli individually invite those present to hold an animal skull between them and move together through the space. Holding death, Anegeli\u2019s performance creates a space to question and challenge socio-cultural constructions of identity. Working at the intersection of disciplines and expanded practices, Sion\u2019s work investigate the performative nature of the body, image, garment, text and other materials. An artist and independent scholar based in New-York city, Angeli is most interested in art that conditions chaos through intensities, resonances and sensations as embodied practice. Her educational background includes a MA in Performance Studies from Tisch School of the Arts, New York University \u201812, and a BFA in fashion theory &amp; practice, w. a focus in performance, Parsons \u201911.<\/p> <p>\u201cNightmare in White\u201d is an ongoing performance piece that presents the audience with a masked woman in bridal attire. Embodying what is left of a women who chased after the American dream and marriage and was broken by it, Emery Medina awaits for the audience\u2019s reaction and interaction. Medina\u2019s work explore themes of pop culture, social media usage, the female body, and position of women in our society. A multidisciplinary artists who spent most of her artistic career making large scale paintings and sculptural masks in an abstract-expressionist style, Medina uses pop culture motifs and the female figure with bold vibrant colors and shape in her work. She is a New York-based artist and a graduate from the Fashion Institute of Technology with a major in Fine Arts and minor in Art history.<\/p> <p>The Espejo Organization for the Arts is a Bushwick-based arts management organization that is committed to promote the artistic endeavors of mid-career and emerging international artists and creatives. This performance art night is part of EOarts Performance Art Series 2016, an action art program that aims to survey international performance art practices and bring them closer to the public.\u201cThrough this performance art series we aim to offer an open and inviting platform where international artists and the public can meet. We want to invite the audience to participate in and engage with performance art, understanding better what this art medium is really about: the power of symbolic action.\u201d said Kika Espejo, founder and director of the the organization.<\/p> <p>The Rabbithole Projects Gallery, an art space located on the waterfront of the Dumbo Arts District in Brooklyn, will host EOarts Performance Art Series 2016. \u201cOur goal is to provide the space and community access for talented artists to share their dreams, visions, and creations with inspired attendees.

Purchase both at the same time and pay only $20 for the night!<\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p><b>Volunteers get in for\u00a0FREE!<br\/><\/b>Email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>\u00a0to inquire about volunteer opportunities.<\/p> <p>Stay informed:\u00a0<b><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/fGoUk\">join our mailing list<\/a>!<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/friday-night-blues-new-york-3\"><b>Friday Night Blues NYC is on Yelp!<\/b><\/a>\u00a0If you enjoy our event, please consider leaving us a review.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/www.fridaynightblues.nyc\/about\/locations","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Friday-Night-Blues-NYC\/events\/230966037\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":16200000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","id":"zxkmqlyvhbbc","time":1463790600000,"updated":1463807584000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446516679000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19085086,"urlname":"Friday-Night-Blues-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"63 Clinton St.","name":"Speedy Romeo","lon":-73.985146,"id":24544269,"state":"NY","lat":40.719501,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":2.12693095207,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1463104091000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Place:\u00a0Just like it's Brooklyn predecessor, all dishes are prepared by wood-burning oven and grill.

We'll head north and loop once through Central Park, head over the 59th St Bridge to Queens, ride south and stop for a break at the Brompton Cafe in Williamsburg, cruise down to Dumbo, cross the Manhattan bridge, take a look at the Statue of Liberty from Battery park, ride up through Chinatown, and finally....<\/p> <p>11:15 - We arrive at Veselka, meet anyone who couldn't make the group ride, fold up, take our seats outside along 2nd ave and get settled. <b>UPDATE:\u00a0<\/b>Veselka is generously offering a FREE cup of Borscht to us Brompton riders PLUS a discounted order of 8 Pierogi for $5 (usually $12).

Here we'll break at the Peekskill Brewery for lunch and local brews before getting on the Metro North, conveniently located near the train station, for the trip home. If anyone wants or needs to bail early there are lots of train options, the nearest being Poughkeepsie. Likewise, if anyone wants to have a longer ride there are lots of options for that (leave a comment with your interest\/ideas or message Chris).<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll meet at Grand Central Station at 7:15 on Saturday morning to catch the 7:43 train to Poughkeepsie.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p><b>How long will the meetup be?\u00a0<\/b><br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there.

Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come?

Melissa, this one is for you.\u00a0We're going going to be doing one of the most spectacular hikes in the Northeast and one of my personal favorites -- the Labyrinth and Lemon Squeeze in the Shawgunk Mountains.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll start our hike off in the Mohonk Preserve where we're going to stroll the gentle Undercliff trail, a magnificent spectacle with amazing rock formations to our left and sweeping views of the Hudson Valley to our right. If I ended the hike here, you'd head home feeling satisfied, but this is only the appetizer for the visual and physical feast to come. We will continue on to hike the rock formations known as the Labyrinth and Lemon Squeeze. What the heck are they? They are insane views, a crazy knuckle and knee scraping rock labyrinth, and a claustrophobia-defying climb up a deep crevice capped off by 360 degree views from a sky top tower. Yeah, I know, sounds awesome.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>That's how this hike usually goes...but it's 2016 and the same old, same old doesn't cut it anymore! \u00a0<\/b>Today we're going to explore parts of the preserve that I've yet to lay a foot on; we're looking to stomp some virgin rocks. If you've hiked here with me before you really don't want to skip today. Enough said.\u00a0We may get a little lost. We may have to do some back tracking. Hell, we may even need to call for a rescue party.

You don't need to be a world-class athlete to participate, but you need to be in decent physical shape as this is one of the more challenging treks in area with a bit of elevation gain and a few rock scrambles. We will be out all day so leave your afternoon\/evening open.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0This is a <b>social<\/b> hike, the pace will be moderate -- we'll be stopping to take in the views and smell the flowers.

Melissa, this one is for you.\u00a0We're going going to be doing one of the most spectacular hikes in the Northeast and one of my personal favorites -- the Labyrinth and Lemon Squeeze in the Shawgunk Mountains.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll start our hike off in the Mohonk Preserve where we're going to stroll the gentle Undercliff trail, a magnificent spectacle with amazing rock formations to our left and sweeping views of the Hudson Valley to our right. If I ended the hike here, you'd head home feeling satisfied, but this is only the appetizer for the visual and physical feast to come. We will continue on to hike the rock formations known as the Labyrinth and Lemon Squeeze. What the heck are they? They are insane views, a crazy knuckle and knee scraping rock labyrinth, and a claustrophobia-defying climb up a deep crevice capped off by 360 degree views from a sky top tower. Yeah, I know, sounds awesome.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>That's how this hike usually goes...but it's 2016 and the same old, same old doesn't cut it anymore! <\/b>\u00a0Today we're going to explore parts of the preserve that I've yet to lay a foot on; we're looking to stomp some virgin rocks. If you've hiked here with me before you really don't want to skip today. Enough said.\u00a0We may get a little lost. We may have to do some back tracking.

We will be out all day so leave your afternoon\/evening open.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0This is a\u00a0social\u00a0hike, the pace will be moderate -- we'll be stopping to take in the views and smell the flowers.

The term aggregate refers to groups or bundles of processes from the most basic to the most intricate that are part of every experience. Contemplating and interpreting these processes is our\u00a0window into how our concept of \"self\" gets constructed.<\/p> <p>We'll start with what is most obvious and most tangible, the First Aggregate of physical or material forms. These are the objects around us including our own bodies. We\u00a0understand the Aggregate of Physical Form through our five sense organs and the physical objects to which they correspond; the eyes and visible objects, the ears and sound, the nose and smell, the tongue and taste, and the skin and tangible objects. We also know qualities like color and sound and taste and smell.\u00a0It is helpful at this physical level to describe our \"felt\" sense of the material, physical world and\u00a0work mindfully with physical sensations like heat, cold, pressure, vibration, heaviness or lightness.<\/p> <p>This first teaching is profound in a couple of ways. \u00a0First, not only do we have conscious contact with the objects that correspond to each sense organ, but we can observe their impermanent nature; we observe how they come and go either as a result of our changing attentional focus or the impermanent changeability of the objects.\u00a0Secondly, we can notice how quickly we \"jump\" to the conceptual level where we label and name objects instead of being with the actual, direct experience with objects. This leads us to mistakenly assume that because in our minds the labels we apply don't change, the object itself must also be\u00a0permanent and unchanging. As a result we often forsake our understanding of the\u00a0reality of impermanence.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

You have your priorities and they involve the out of doors and water. And yet, there is that little voice at the back of your head saying: \"Maybe I should be looking for work. I know I need a job and come the fall I will really want to be working . . .\"<\/p> <p>Why not do both? Summer is a time when many people take time to enjoy themselves and work slows down and yet September is one of the biggest hiring months.

This is probably one of the toughest hikes I've done at the reservation, but not terrible, and it's got great views and a reservoir to dip your toes in and swim a little depending on the weather, if that's your thing. I figured I'd make it a couple months from now so you guys could prepare (aka shed any hibernation pounds) for it. I couldn't find a link for this trail online, but it's a pretty straight-forward loop. We'll start on the Orange (Schuber) trail and follow it to the end, which will take us to a really nice overlook. At about that point, the trail turns into Yellow Silver, and we will take that back down until it meets back up with the Orange, near the reservoir.<\/p> <p>I would say this hike is moderate, with some steep parts, and about 8-9 miles. We will be hiking at about 2-3 miles\/hour, or more depending on how fast we can go, as we'll be back around 3. Please make sure you can go at least 2 miles\/hour, as I work in the afternoon, and make sure you've got a good pair of hiking boots, and 2-3 liters of water. If we have time, we will stop for a quick bite to eat at the Mason Jar afterwards.<\/p> <p>Hope to see some of you there! :)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJFunFriends\/events\/229558852\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Noon O' Clock Hiking Series: Ramapo Reservation and Mason Jar","id":"229558852","time":1463846400000,"updated":1463864784000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1331560329000,"name":"Fun Friends","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":3463052,"urlname":"NJFunFriends","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Fun Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"477 5th Ave.","name":"Skylark","lon":-73.987267,"id":6979112,"state":"NY","lat":40.667824,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.69130325317,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463056258000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/6\/2\/600_449897506.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Do you like hanging with the cool kids, making interesting decisions and sipping on drinks as you do it? \u00a0Then you're invited! \u00a0Join us as we nerd-out collectively with light, fun board and card games. \u00a0This will be a standard edition of our monthly meetup--an all day celebration of dice, cardboard and unique shared experiences with good people!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/e\/7\/600_445934311.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Our Tabletop Day meetup will feature a large bearded man (let's call him Bill) with a bag full of games for good boys and girls to play. \u00a0All you'll need is a fun, competitive spirit and a <b>$3 donation for the Impact Network<\/b> (learn more\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.impactnetwork.org\/\">here<\/a>). \u00a0Regulars and myself will happily and patiently explain these games to anyone who joins.

The practice is appropriate for students of all levels, from beginner to lifelong practitioners and accessible to so many because it meets each student where they are and according to their condition. As students move through the different series, they are encouraged to go deeper and experience the practice in a meditative and spiritual way. Sri Dharma\u2019s passion for helping students go deeper in their practice using only the best and most efficient techniques with the ultimate goal of Self-realization (gaining absolute knowledge of the True Self) is reflected in all aspects of the Dharma Yoga system.<\/p> <p>Dharma Yoga has roots in all nine forms of yoga, including Hatha, Raja, Karma, Kriya, Bhakti, Japa, Laya and Jnana, as well as a focus on the Eight Limbs of Yoga (Patanjali\u2019s Ashtanga Yoga) with great emphasis placed on Yama and Niyama. Sri Dharma was given an extraordinary gift of knowledge in receiving yoga directly from his Guru, Sri Swami Kailashananda a.k.a. Yogi Gupta, for over a decade beginning in the early 1960\u2032s. During this period of intense study, Sri Dharma was exposed to various yoga techniques that he has refined over an almost half century of practice and teaching into the Dharma Yoga he and his certified teachers the world over continue to share with their students each day.<\/p> <p>In essence, Dharma Yoga is a system of classical Hatha-Raja Yoga. A devotional practice that emphasizes good health, a clear mind and a kind heart.

It has a really long track with little hills which is fun for trick boards or longboards.

She's best known as an expert on romantic love, and her beautifully penned books \u2014 including Anatomy of Love and Why We Love \u2014 lay bare the mysteries of our most treasured emotion.Why you should listen<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Helen Fisher's courageous investigations of romantic love -- its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its vital importance to human society -- are informing and transforming the way we understand ourselves.\u00a0Fisher describes love as a universal human drive (stronger than the sex drive; stronger than thirst or hunger; stronger perhaps than the will to live), and her many areas of inquiry shed light on timeless human mysteries, like why we choose one partner over another.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Almost unique among scientists,\u00a0Fisher explores the science of love without losing a sense of romance: Her work frequently invokes poetry, literature and art -- along with scientific findings -- helping us appreciate our love affair with love itself. In her research, and in books such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.randomhouse.com\/catalog\/display.pperl?isbn=9780449908976\">Anatomy of Love<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.holtzbrinckpublishers.com\/henryholt\/search\/SearchBookDisplay.asp?BookKey=1291747\">Why We Love<\/a>,\u00a0and her latest work\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/whyhimwhyher\">Why Him? Why Her?: How to Find and Keep Lasting Love<\/a>,\u00a0Fisher looks at questions with real impact on modern life. Her latest research raises serious concerns about the widespread, long-term use of antidepressants, which may undermine our natural process of attachment by tampering with hormone levels in the brain.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>What others say<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cIn hands as skilled and sensitive as Fisher's, scientific analysis of love only adds to its magic.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Scientific American\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher<\/a><\/a><\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><b>Join us in Bryant Park for fresh air, sun, and conversation. \u00a0<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Share your observations.\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/>--Greet old friends and meet new one. \u00a0<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>(***NOTE - This outdoor event is weather contingent.

She's best known as an expert on romantic love, and her beautifully penned books \u2014 including Anatomy of Love and Why We Love \u2014 lay bare the mysteries of our most treasured emotion.Why you should listen<\/p> <p>Helen Fisher's courageous investigations of romantic love -- its evolution, its biochemical foundations and its vital importance to human society -- are informing and transforming the way we understand ourselves.\u00a0Fisher describes love as a universal human drive (stronger than the sex drive; stronger than thirst or hunger; stronger perhaps than the will to live), and her many areas of inquiry shed light on timeless human mysteries, like why we choose one partner over another.<\/p> <p>Almost unique among scientists,\u00a0Fisher explores the science of love without losing a sense of romance: Her work frequently invokes poetry, literature and art -- along with scientific findings -- helping us appreciate our love affair with love itself. In her research, and in books such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.randomhouse.com\/catalog\/display.pperl?isbn=9780449908976\">Anatomy of Love<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.holtzbrinckpublishers.com\/henryholt\/search\/SearchBookDisplay.asp?BookKey=1291747\">Why We Love<\/a>,\u00a0and her latest work\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/whyhimwhyher\">Why Him? Why Her?: How to Find and Keep Lasting Love<\/a>,\u00a0Fisher looks at questions with real impact on modern life. Her latest research raises serious concerns about the widespread, long-term use of antidepressants, which may undermine our natural process of attachment by tampering with hormone levels in the brain.<\/p> <p><b>What others say <\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cIn hands as skilled and sensitive as Fisher's, scientific analysis of love only adds to its magic.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Scientific American\"<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ted.com\/speakers\/helen_fisher<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/2\/7\/highres_447373351.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Join us in Bryant Park for fresh air, sun, and conversation.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Share your observations.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>--Greet old friends and meet new one.<\/b> \u00a0<\/p> <p><i>(***NOTE - This outdoor event is weather contingent.

Every musical and dramatic work takes its audience on a journey, generally consisting of the following elements:<\/p> <p>1-) Introduction and elaboration: The central melodic theme is introduced and often repeated, in identical fashion or with variation. The mood of the piece is presented and established via use of dynamics, tempo and melodic arc.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> draw in the audience at this point, either with a compelling narrative subtext, or strong emotional message. Also, the performer must build gradual tension (when applicable), leading the audience to the musical <i>climax<\/i>.<\/p> <p>2-) Climax: The highest emotional point of the work, usually occurring 2\/3 to \u00be into the piece. Requires maximum expression and melodic emphasis to evoke a desired reaction or response from the audience. Also considered a reward point, or tension release for the audience.<\/p> <p><i>The performer should<\/i> fully understand the climactic point of the piece, and clearly highlight this point via the use of tone, dynamic expression and musical touch. The importance of the climax for audience understanding and satisfaction cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>3-) Resolution: The conclusion of the piece, during which all unresolved musical elements are resolved in a decisive manner.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> prepare the audience for the eventual end of the musical journey, a return to reality. Musical cues which aid this transition include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 gradual decrescendo and diminuendo<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 a clear a decisive \u00a0end point , so as to not leave the audience with an uneasy feeling of something unresolved<\/p> <p>Entertain your audience: Great entertainers (actors, singers, etc.) put their unique personality into every performance. If you want to make a memorable impression upon your audience, introduce a new, unique perspective on your piece. Once you truly own your piece, it should carry the inimitable stamp of your personality, but also <i>sound as if it is being performed for the first time<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Select pieces that are personally meaningful to you, and allow for your maximum expression as both performer and entertainer.<\/p> <p>Performances do not have to be memorized, or note-perfect. However, as a courtesy to your audience, please present a work that you have studied attentively, and can play to its completion.<\/p> <p>If you make a mistake during your performance, <i>please continue to play without stopping<\/i>. Apologizing, repeating a previously played section, or stopping will only call more attention to your mistake.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"website: www.nycclassical.com, email: acma@nycclassical.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/classical-139\/events\/231061811\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"duration":7200000,"name":"ACMA May 2016 Concert","id":"231061811","time":1463860800000,"updated":1463869799000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202513261000,"name":"Amateur Classical Musicians Association","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1001619,"urlname":"classical-139","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Classical Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"3 West 18th Street","name":"The City Bakery","lon":-73.992348,"id":24390518,"state":"NY","lat":40.738953,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.774754405022,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462869864000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be an informal discussion on our challenges with social confidence, where we have been, and how we want to improve.<\/p> <p>I will be leading the meeting and offering advice, but everyone will be welcome to share their successes and insights on social confidence.<\/p> <p>Chances are, no matter what your current challenges, you have some positive experiences that can help other guys.<\/p> <p><b>The City Bakery<\/b><\/p> <p><b>3 West 18th Street<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Upstairs (second floor)<\/b><\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>Justin<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/JustinAttraction.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/JustinAttraction.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/JustinAttraction.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/NaturalAttractionNYC.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/NaturalAttractionNYC.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/NaturalAttractionNYC.com<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Upstairs","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Eliminate-Anxiety-Get-Social-Dating-Confidence-For-Men\/events\/231010756\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":3600000,"name":"Social Confidence Challenges & Successes: Discussion","id":"231010756","time":1463860800000,"updated":1463866823000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427917633000,"name":"Social Confidence for Men","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18529586,"urlname":"Eliminate-Anxiety-Get-Social-Dating-Confidence-For-Men","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Guys"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.04892647266,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1463066127000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Japanese learners!
