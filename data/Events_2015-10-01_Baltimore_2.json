The human body has evolved to perceive consciousness that endures beyond physical death. When shrouded in secrecy, shame and guilt, the impact of prior generations\u2019 traumas appear as the present generations\u2019 emotional disturbances, chronic physical symptoms, and painful relationship patterns.
