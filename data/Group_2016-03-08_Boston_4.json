I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in Boston. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have. Or simply say hello and introduce yourself because I would like to learn about you and the projects you are working on! See you soon!<\/p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: This Meetup group is not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization.

Long live hardware!<\/p>\n<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.<\/p>\n<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.<\/p>\n<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the \"onesy\" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or \"dumb\" cars?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being \"merely\" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The Boston Connected &amp; Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.<\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64960062,"name":"Babak Kia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/highres_247682322.jpeg","photo_id":247682322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/member_247682322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/1\/2\/thumb_247682322.jpeg"}},"members":131,"name":"Boston Connected & Intelligent Device Meetup","id":19232780,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Connected-Intelligent-Device-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Endpoints"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Natick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450824655000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"acting","name":"Acting","id":226},{"urlkey":"sketch","name":"Sketch Comedy","id":8207},{"urlkey":"education","name":"Education","id":8476},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"beginners-acting-training","name":"Beginners Acting Training","id":15919},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"courses-and-workshops","name":"Courses and Workshops","id":20629},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"actors-actresses","name":"Actors, Actresses","id":31083},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"theatre-and-performance-acting-workshop","name":"Theatre and Performance Acting Workshop","id":37506},{"urlkey":"improv","name":"Improv","id":53513},{"urlkey":"acting-classes-for-adults","name":"Acting Classes for Adults","id":70493},{"urlkey":"lgbt-friendly","name":"LGBT Friendly","id":107996},{"urlkey":"peer2peer","name":"Peer2Peer","id":952412}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/metrowestperformers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><b>This is a Natick-based acting and improvisation group for anyone (18 and older) who is interested in acting, improvisational comedy or other aspects of acting.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.3499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/highres_445378718.jpeg","photo_id":445378718,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/600_445378718.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/5\/5\/e\/thumb_445378718.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":25209652,"name":"Mark Schuman","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/highres_249437640.jpeg","photo_id":249437640,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/member_249437640.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/8\/thumb_249437640.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Metro West Performers","id":19233336,"state":"MA","urlname":"metrowestperformers","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Performers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Framingham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1450861440000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Russian-Speaking-Engineering-and-Science-Professionals\/","rating":0,"description":"If you work in the arena of Engineering, Science and Information Technology and speak Russian (possibly as second language) this group is for you.

It is the opportunity for believers and non believers to get together and share their philosophical views on existentialism, share their struggles in the defiance towards status quo or peer influence, and find happiness through open mindedness, volunteer work and other sorts of humanism. I developed a philosophical posture in life called Igocentrism. Science has shown us how the three main sources of happiness are the so called Intrinsic Sources: self growth, relationships and the giving to others. However, society is negatively impacted by the pursuit of the so called Extrinsic Sources: money, status, and physical appearance. I believe this unrelenting idolatry towards the feeding of one self leads to ego-centrism, so I figured an appropriate antonym should name this new-founded ideology. Igocentrism also focuses on the liberation from religious belief, as in the societal definition of \"religion\". It is a deist approach to the existence of God - not necessarily atheist and yet open to the possibility of a non intellectual creator - which commends a utilitarian morality over an epistemological religious morality based on scripture. This group is intended for people who would like to learn more about igocentrism and hopefully find bliss in what could very possibly be the only finite life we have in this world.<\/p>","lon":-71.0100021362,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/highres_445470094.jpeg","photo_id":445470094,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/600_445470094.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/8\/e\/thumb_445470094.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197384954,"name":"Ricardo Martins","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/highres_252416562.jpeg","photo_id":252416562,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/member_252416562.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/f\/2\/thumb_252416562.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"I.G.O Society of Free Thinkers","id":19250158,"state":"MA","urlname":"I-G-O-Society-of-Igocentric-Free-Thinkers","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.2400016785,"who":"Igomaniacs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451425174000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"charity-work","name":"Charity Work","id":16453},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"charity","name":"Charity","id":25598},{"urlkey":"cancer-support-group","name":"Cancer Support Group","id":33425},{"urlkey":"charity-events","name":"Charity Events","id":54006},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Young-Professionals-Group-The-Lemon-Society\/","rating":0,"description":"The Lemon Society of Boston is a young professionals group which allows members to network with other like-minded professionals, build leadership skills and contribute to a worthy cause all while having a great time!

Increasingly studies are attesting to the powerful effects sound vibration has on our physical and emotional well-being. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mantra, which means \u201cthat which saves the mind\u201d or \u201cinstruments of the mind\u201d, is a collection of mathematically precise and melodic Sanskrit sound vibrations designed for specific energetic intentions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the Maha Mantra called the \u201cgreat\u201d Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This specific Mantra deemed \u201cgreat\u201d for two reasons: 1) it is one of very few mantras that combines both the feminine and masculine divinities simultaneously. 2) It can be chanted at any time and place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the origin of the Maha Mantra?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Mantra is found in the Kali-santara Upanishad, one of the 108 principle Upanishads, and was given by Brahma to the sage Narada.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the benefits of Japa Meditation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because the Maha Mantra combines both the feminine and masculine it is a Bhakti mantra or \u201cmantra of loving relationships\u201d. This works on transforming and improving the practitioner\u2019s ability to have relationships on three levels - 1) Personal (relationship with oneself); 2) Interpersonal (relationships with others); and 3) Spiritual (relationship with the divine). <\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Japa Circles?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Japa Circles provide a powerful space in which the simultaneous recitation by all members amplifies the energy of the mantra exponentially. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What takes place at a Japa Circle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 5 minutes the practitioner performs preparatory&nbsp;breathing and mindfulness exercises. For 20 minutes the actual Japa meditation takes place. Practitioners recite the mantra softly in rhythm and cadence with the instructor with increasing relaxation and concentration. The final 5 minutes is used for the concluding breathing exercises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of the various levels?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Maha Mantra was handed down with a recommendation that the practitioner recite the mantra 35 million times! The various levels are designed to give us impetus and inspiration. However, in the more mature stages of our personal development these levels become superfluous as the joy and transformation awakened by our Japa meditation becomes its own reward. <\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/highres_447295668.jpeg","photo_id":447295668,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/600_447295668.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/7\/4\/thumb_447295668.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120115562,"name":"Maha Visnu Gray","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/highres_158975632.jpeg","photo_id":158975632,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/member_158975632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/b\/3\/0\/thumb_158975632.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"Japa (Mantra Meditation) Classes -

If you are looking to expand your social circle, make new friends with similar interests and embrace all that this area has to offer then this is the group for you! Will plan events such as dinners, concerts, museums, theatre, wine tastings, spa days, cooking classes, afternoon teas, sporting events, day trips, 5k runs, casual weekend brunches, monthly movie nights at local theaters, etc. and even a book club. &nbsp;Events will take place in the city and the metro area. &nbsp;Suggestions are welcome!<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>General Housekeeping Items:<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><br><br><span>-RSVP: please keep this up to date as much as possible. Understand we all get busy &amp; must changes plans time to time, but the group is quite large...want to make certain space for those that can attend. Also as with most groups, no shows are not unacceptable and will be removed from the group. &nbsp;Also try to only RSVP if you think you will be able to attend. Much appreciated!&nbsp;<\/span><br><br><br><br><span>-Group size: there's been loads of interest in the group, but I'm going to try to keep it at 110. I'm always more the merrier however several of the events are \"wait lists\" and want to be fair to current members. Also to make sure each of you get to attend events. Where I can, such as museums, etc. those will not have limits.&nbsp;<\/span><br><br><br><br><span>-Attendance: received comments as to why I've limited events, there are several reasons. Mostly due to the restaurants &amp; group size they will take. 12-15 tends to be the maximum. Also if the groups are too large it's hard to know one another. Ask that you only attend if you are on the \"yes\" list. Some of the venues are pretty strict!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><br><br><br><br><span>Book club: excited there is so much interest. Ideally this will be an standard group of around 20 of us &amp; we'll rotate hosting at our homes, parks, the beach, etc. This is what I had set up for my club in NY &amp; it was fabulous! At some point it will not be a \"Meetup\" event but rather just the book club. I really do not like holding them in restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><br><br><br><br><span>-Profiles: understand we all want &amp; need to protect our privacy. I've done the best to keep our group as \"private\" as possible. Do ask however that your profile include a photo of you &amp; your name...this way we can all recognize you when attending events.

Initially, we'll be in Braintree, Massachusetts (which is why I've changed the group name in honor of the nearby Blue Hills reservation south of Boston). Later, we may meet in Natick, Massachusetts, or other locations. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our group is open to adult writers (you must be 18+ to join; younger teens are welcome to attend as the guests of adult members). Typically, our Meetups begin with introductions and a few creative prompts. Then we'll spend the rest of our time writing in companionable silence, with occasional breaks. Toward the end of the Meetup, we'll invite people to share what they've written, if they wish. Our venues have everything we need: private rooms with tables and chairs, restrooms, kitchenettes, and free parking. We provide extension cords and power strips for laptops and creative-writing guides for onsite inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, we may offer writing workshops, but for now, the focus is on simply gathering to write. Signing up for events is easy. Just join this Meetup group (membership is free). Then RSVP \"yes\" for the events that interest you.

Now what? Well, there are admirable ladies who can handle cancer diagnoses with grace and compassion; not for themselves solely but mostly for the sake of people around them. They are my idols but I knew from the get-go that I am absolutely not yet one of them. I want to scream, throw a tantrum, kicking up like a baby while whining and sobbing and swearing on the floor. I don't act like this all the time though because it requires a bit physical strength. Never less, I believe that we ladies have the right to react to cancer however we wish to, and those superheroes need a break every now and then too. So I started this group with one goal in mind- for my fellow lady cancer carriers to be openly emotional, freely expressional, and swear at cancer until we exhausted all dirty words we know, then we go shopping and eating and dancing like no tomorrow.

Whether you help out full-time or just a few hours a week, caregiving is hard work and can be a strain on our emotional, psychological, financial, and physical well-being. Maybe you work at the same time, or have a family of your own to take care of, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This meet-up group is for informal caregivers of older adults on the South Shore. It is a space to socialize with others who understand your challenges, share your experiences and learn from other caregivers who are in a similar position, and hopefully have a few good laughs too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even if the loved one whom you cared for has recently passed, and you are still dealing with how all that feels you are welcome to join us. You were there, understand us and have something to bring to the group.<\/p>\n<p>Since taking on the care of my Mother 5 years ago, I personally feel somewhat isolated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My established friends do not stand my unique situation and don't understand the challenges and stress caregiving brings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join the group for coffee dates, lunches, brunches, dinners, seminars (when I can find them), guest speakers, or even movie nights and other events.

This Meetup is for people from all spiritual backgrounds, all faith and and belief systems, and all nationalities, who are interested in receiving help and healing on the spiritual path through Bruno Groening's teachings. <\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening (1906-1959), a simple German man, taught that \"a divine power exists and it can heal. \" He had very precise, intuitive knowledge of this healing power and&nbsp; made it freely available to everyone through his teachings, helping thousands of people receive help and healing. His teachings continue to be shared today through one of the world\u2019s largest non-profit organizations for spiritual healing, the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends.&nbsp; Healings continue to this day, even of so called incurable diseases, and are recorded and verified by medical doctors and psychologists in all major specialties who work together in the Circle of Friends' Medical Scientific Group (MWF).<br><\/p>\n<p>The Circle of Friends passes on these simple teachings free of charge through information lectures throughout the world. We invite you to attend Introductory lectures and film showings in the Boston area and experience this healing energy for yourself, in a simple and natural way. (See our Calendar for upcoming events.) There is no fee. Donations are appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno Groening friends also meet locally every three weeks at Community Hours to take in the divine healing energy together. In the Boston area we currently have a Community that meets in Andover, and we are hoping to open another community closer to downtown Boston in the spring. Other New England Communities meet in South Hadley, MA, in Maine (Freeport and Ellsworth), and in Vermont (St. Johnsbury.) See our calendar for these&nbsp;Communities' schedules. All who wish to attend the Community Hours need to be introduced to the teachings of Bruno Groening beforehand, either at an Introductory lecture, or by phone.&nbsp; Contact the Organizer for more information.<br><\/p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you soon, and we invite you to contact us for more information. <br><\/p>\n<p> All warmest wishes to you on your path,<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Susan Downing <\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Meetup Organizer and leader for New England Communities <br><\/p>\n<p>413-531-6677 <br><\/p>\n<p>susan.downing.bg@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Eric Guyer<\/b><br><\/p>\n<p>Leader of the Andover Community <br><\/p>\n<p>guyer.eric@gmail.com <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>More about the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends: The \"Bruno Groening Circle of Friends\" is a well respected international organization founded in 1979 by Grete Hausler (1922-2007) that was recently publicly awarded the \"Peace Pole\" by the United Nation's World Peace Prayer Society (WPPS), on May 23, 2013.

Our half-day workshop on taking the next step toward untying the knot will cover the legal, financial, family and personal issues that are often encountered during the divorce process. Trained professionals (Family Law Attorneys, Mediators, Divorce Financial Analysts and Child\/Family Specialists) will provide you with knowledge and information you need to know to empower you through the divorce process with confidence and peace of mind. All our presenters are volunteers and members of The Divorce Center. We do not self-promote our own practices. We are committed to providing you with unbiased information in a compassionate and understanding way. Is Litigation the only way to go? Is Mediation or the Collaborative Process right for you? What is considered a marital asset in Massachusetts? How is child support and alimony calculated? How do we tell the children about our divorce? These questions and many others will be answered during our workshops. Each attendee receives our 32-page Resource Handbook as well The Divorce Center's Directory of Divorce Professionals. Light breakfast and beverages are included in the $30 registration fee. Pre-registration is required at www.thedivorcecenter.org. Workshops are held on the second Saturday of every other month in several Metro West locations. Other workshops say they donate their proceeds to a non-profit...we are the only non-profit in Massachusetts offering these services to the public. Your fee helps to support our mission of making divorce more civil and less traumatic, by providing you with the education and support you need to make the best choices for you and your family.","lon":-71.4300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":160000192,"name":"Diane Pappas","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/highres_216404192.jpeg","photo_id":216404192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/member_216404192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/c\/a\/0\/thumb_216404192.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"The Divorce Center - Next Step Workshop - Untying the Knot","id":19412777,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-Divorce-Center-Next-Step-Workshop-Untying-the-Knot","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453480015000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"art-galleries","name":"Art Galleries","id":23027},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526},{"urlkey":"art-museums","name":"Art Museums","id":112256},{"urlkey":"arts-culture","name":"Arts & Culture","id":154787}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MFA-Boston-Museum-Council-Meet-Ups\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Museum Council of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is a membership group for supporters ages 21 to 45 with exciting annual programming designed to bring you closer to the collections at the MFA and the arts scene in Boston.

I didn't when I started either ;) We just ask that you bring a good attitude and a desire to meet new people.","lon":-71.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/f\/5\/highres_446299701.jpeg","photo_id":446299701,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/f\/5\/600_446299701.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/f\/5\/thumb_446299701.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182369512,"name":"Jonathan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/1\/a\/highres_252418906.jpeg","photo_id":252418906,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/1\/a\/member_252418906.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/1\/a\/thumb_252418906.jpeg"}},"members":290,"name":"Game Nightapalooza","id":19418728,"state":"MA","urlname":"Game-Nightapalooza","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Gamers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Framingham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453565361000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"reiki-share","name":"Reiki Share","id":20779},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Community-Reiki-Circle\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This group is for all who are interested in learning how to use Reiki to express their full human&nbsp;potential and help&nbsp;make the world a&nbsp;better&nbsp;place with<\/span><span>&nbsp;Reiki healing. &nbsp;We also support each other through Reiki sessions and trainings to manifest more health, balance and happiness in our own lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.4300003052,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/6\/b\/highres_446732107.jpeg","photo_id":446732107,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/6\/b\/600_446732107.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/6\/b\/thumb_446732107.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":75522252,"name":"Lou","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/2\/highres_252810546.jpeg","photo_id":252810546,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/2\/member_252810546.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/7\/5\/2\/thumb_252810546.jpeg"}},"members":30,"name":"Northeast Reiki Lightworkers","id":19419665,"state":"MA","urlname":"Free-Community-Reiki-Circle","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Lightworkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453572318000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"usability","name":"Usability","id":26938},{"urlkey":"product-development","name":"Product Development","id":42012},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"product-management","name":"Product Management","id":93740},{"urlkey":"product-marketing","name":"Product Marketing","id":93741},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"product-management-in-agile","name":"Product management in agile","id":133666}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Product-Management-Association-bpma\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>Power up your career and build your network of product management and product marketing professionals in the Boston area, by attending educational live events in and around Boston. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The Boston Product Management Association (<\/span><span>BPMA) helps develop the careers of Boston area product managers and product marketers through monthly events, workshops, job resources and more.

I thought I would start a meet up for pregnant ladies who are just looking to make friends with other pregnant ladies and\/or young parents. <br>I'm 22 and moved to Boston (area.. Quincy actually) almost two years ago from Canada. I don't know any other young parents in the area or pregnant ladies at all here and figured there must be other people looking for new friends and a good support network too! So I am making this group to hopefully connect others who are in the same situation, who would like to meet and make good friendships with other pregnant ladies and\/or parents! My idea is to set up meeting spots once a week for whoever is free- to come along and I'll give details for each meetup! As well if anyone else wants to make their own 'event' or has a cool idea for a meetup spot and time feel free to post it or let me know or whatever!

We know that it's easy to despair over some of the critical yet commonplace issues in our society- climate change, racial inequality, a staggering income gap, Washington infighting. We chose, instead, to take action to address the root of these issues- Democracy! We at Small Planet Institute are focused on what we call \"living democracy,\" which is both a daily personal practice and a requirement of a government that answers to its people. To attain the kind of democracy we want to see, we're tackling, with a strong network of others, the all-powerful hand of big money in politics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this light, we're happy to announce our Democracy Den community gatherings, held in our Harvard Square office.

Families sign up to host other families in their homes on weekends to play games. While the children play the above mentioned video games together, the adults have fun as well playing family friendly group games of their own. Games played can be agreed upon ahead of time or decided on the fly. The Rules Are Simple: Children's Video Games: An adult must be present to supervise their child(ren) at all times Each child must bring their own controller w\/ charger (this is in case it breaks) Other video games can be played, so long as they are rated \"Teen\" or BELOW and all attending parents agree Adult Games: all games played must be family friendly (using no vulgar language or inappropriate gestures)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>NOTE: Remember you are in someone else's home. Please be courteous, mindful of your language &amp;amp; respect house rules. Above all, HAVE FUN!!! An Important Note To Food and Drinks!

By targeting fundamental math concepts we can directly provide lessons that move from the concrete to the abstract.Furthermore, by blending the STEM subjects with art we can motivate our students, decrease discipline problems, increase retention of knowledge, and assist the instruction of visual learners, kinesthetic learners, and English Language Learners.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189552797,"name":"ladawn strickland","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/b\/d\/highres_253776797.jpeg","photo_id":253776797,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/b\/d\/member_253776797.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/b\/d\/thumb_253776797.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Roxbury Homeschooling Meetup : STEM-ing your lessons","id":19555482,"state":"MA","urlname":"Roxbury-Homeschooling-Meetup-STEM-ing-your-lessons","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"METCO Not US Homeschool Network"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Salem","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455224330000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"community","name":"Community","id":15227},{"urlkey":"support-group","name":"Support Group","id":15275},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mothers-Grieving-Loss-of-Relationship-with-Adult-Daughters\/","rating":4.5,"description":"Support group to help mothers of adult daughters cope with what seems to be unexplainable loss of a relationship.","lon":-70.9000015259,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":199557462,"name":"Donna Delaney","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/e\/2\/highres_253780930.jpeg","photo_id":253780930,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/e\/2\/member_253780930.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/e\/2\/thumb_253780930.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Mothers Grieving Loss of Relationship with Adult Daughters","id":19556337,"state":"MA","urlname":"Mothers-Grieving-Loss-of-Relationship-with-Adult-Daughters","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Moms"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Cambridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455234129000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"fine-arts","name":"Fine Arts","id":16389},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"visual-performing-literary-artists","name":"Visual, Performing, & Literary Artists","id":17298},{"urlkey":"creative-arts","name":"Creative Arts","id":24865},{"urlkey":"fiction-writing","name":"Fiction Writing","id":35807},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"artists-learning-from-artists","name":"Artists learning from Artists","id":148563}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cocktails-for-Writers-Artists\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a group for writers and artists between the ages of 25 and 40, who like to drink cocktails and who want to meet each other in small groups.

Violence, including war, is not an acceptable means for human beings to settle disputes. In the age of thermonuclear weapons, war risks annihilation of our species, which is an unacceptable risk. Schiller Institute founder Helga Zepp-LaRouche has organized a series of international conferences dedicated to creating a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d worthy of mankind, and this chorus is part of that effort. Now the Schiller Institute Community Chorus has expanded to the Boston area and we rehearse every Saturday in Cambridge. The chorus is open to all, regardless of experience and proficiency.

We also like to meet up with people who just want to eat, drink, dance, or socialize with music in the background. The exact nature of the jam will depend on who is participating and where it is held, but the goal is to play with minimal discussion and no preparation. Don't expect any level of skill or familiarity, so no covers. This style of play does result in some rough patches. We develop a strange appreciation of these rough spots; however, the goal is to find grooves. We don't mind riding through some mess, but we also try to hold onto those groovy riffs. We shoot for something between the chaotic, dissonant nature of free improvisation and the tedium of practiced music. At the end of the day, it is just supposed to be fun. Nobody should ever tell anyone else they are messing up. But at the same time, everyone should be trying to play in such a way that it is easy for others to work with. This might mean playing simple repetitive patterns with a limited set of tones (or keeping a steady beat on the drums). No theory is necessary, but if you are curious, look into the Circle of Fifths, pentatonic scales, and keys. We like to switch around on the instruments. It is helpful if everyone is willing to play drums for a bit (drumming the whole time can be tiresome). Anyway, hopefully that long description didn't scare you away. We look forward to meeting you!<\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/2\/4\/highres_447232004.jpeg","photo_id":447232004,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/2\/4\/600_447232004.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/2\/4\/thumb_447232004.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13018708,"name":"Chad","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/0\/2\/highres_251929922.jpeg","photo_id":251929922,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/0\/2\/member_251929922.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/3\/0\/2\/thumb_251929922.jpeg"}},"members":83,"name":"Alewife Jams - a playful group for improvisational music","id":19616018,"state":"MA","urlname":"Alewife-Jams-a-playful-group-for-improvisational-music","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"people"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456276718000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"girls-having-fun","name":"Girls having fun","id":15413},{"urlkey":"single-girlfriends","name":"Single Girlfriends","id":110075}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-Girls-In-Your-Thirties-New-To-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Looking to meet new girlfriends for social and fun!

Since 2012, LOCS unites LBTQ women of color and allies for a day of networking, advocacy and empowerment. LOCS features 60-75 minute workshops\/sessions focusing on various topics impacting our community. The 4th Annual LOCS will be held on Saturday, March 19, 2016. LOCS Collective\u2019s purpose is to address the gross disparities that exist regarding access to community and resources for LBTQ women of color in Boston and surrounding areas. Concurrently, there are few organizations dedicated to providing services solely to LBTQ women of color. Our vision is to create spaces\/platforms for LBTQ identified women of color in Boston and surrounding areas to celebrate our vibrant culture, solidify our community and increase our visibility. We do this by: Developing partnerships with regional and national organizations that serve and support LBTQ identified women of color and streamlining their resources into our communities. Encouraging supportive and respectful discussions within and outside our community. Empowering through activism, education and networking. ALLY PRIDE: In addition to uplifting LBTQ communities of color we also recognize the undeniable necessity to foster genuine and wholesome relationships with our allies, charging ourselves as well as other communities to actively advocate for one another. We encourage community collaboration and development.

My 20+ year's of research into what ails America has led me to publish a book \u201cCulture War Cracked\u201d to broadcast my shocking conclusion that what conservatives know of as the \"Culture War\" is in fact King George's Counter-American Revolution being waged secretly. He established his bulwarks against our Constitution at Fortress Harvard, switched his ammo from black powder to white powder (opium) and his loyalists have been waging a self-funding, perpetual war against our freedoms for hundreds of years. So, clearly I need some face-to-face time to prove myself out, as my thesis must sound like quite a stretch! But seriously, my book proves this out by connecting the dots with details of our history that\u2019ve been hidden from view. I posted the press release at SavingATB.com (short for Saving America the Beautiful). Free PDF download of my 98 page book, Culture War Cracked, at 911BloodTrail.com. Once I get enough interested, I hope to have meetings in and around Boston. I anticipate multiple meet-ups each month since this topic is huge and this election is marching forward. I can imagine holding them in places like Boston, Framingham, Peabody, Burlington, Waltham, Dedham and Quincy. This all depends of interest level though. To peek your interest in the subjects we\u2019ll discuss, I have reverse engineered the Culture War and can shatter both the Establishment Class and the New World Order with relative ease. It just took lots of Googling and plenty of inspiration. And I have found the King\u2019s bloody thumbprints all over our academia, which he infiltrated from Harvard on down, to pump his addictive white powder and transform our nation into one of dependency and addiction. So, I have solutions to win the drug war and save lives by keeping kids straight. I hope to meet you!

Hence the reason we all need to connect. This is a group for Lightworkers, healers, spiritual practitioners, or anyone who feels called to Lightworking, including empaths and sensitives.
