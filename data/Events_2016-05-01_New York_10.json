Dr. Philip Orton will explain how scientists gauge sea levels and predict at-risk flood zones.

By age 13, he was already a constant presence in his own darkroom, developing and sharpening his printing skills on the enlarger he\u2019d bought with money saved from a paper route. His early passion then led him to study graphic arts in high school and to work in the printing industry, which he followed upon graduation with a six-year position in a commercial studio in Newark, NJ, and then as staff photographer with the ITT Corporation in Nutley, NJ, a position he held for eight years.<\/p> <p>In the later 1970\u2019s, Schwab began his formal education in photography at New York City\u2019s School of Visual Arts and The New School for Social Research. At The New School, Schwab studied with renowned photographers George Tice and Lisette Modell, whom he befriended and continued to study privately with her up until her death in 1982.<\/p> <p>Professionally during this time, Schwab taught photography at New York City\u2019s famed Germain\u00a0 School of Photography, and later became a well known black and white printer for Photographics Unlimited in the heart of New York\u2019s Photo District.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The 1990\u2019s brought a time of artistic reevaluation for Schwab. In an attempt to more deeply explore photography as an art form, Schwab studied figure drawing at the Art Students League, and painting, sculpture, and printmaking at Brooklyn College where he earned both his Bachelor\u2019s and Master of Fine Art degrees. It was here, at Brooklyn College, that he developed his current interest in historical photographic processes.\u00a0Doug Schwab taught photography as an adjunct professor at Kingsborough Community College for many years, as well as at Adelphi University, and Pratt Institute. Currently, Schwab is a Tenured Assistant Professor of Photography at Brooklyn College. He has also had the recent good fortune to collaborate with Robert Gurbo, Curator for the Estate of Andre Kertesz, as a prepress digital editor for two books by Robert Gurbo of Kertesz\u2019s work, Andre Kertesz: The Polaroids, and Andre Kertesz. On Reading, by Robert Gurbo. Both books published by W. W.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It's simple, can be done almost anywhere, and it's fun. I like thinking of creative, positive, and sometimes witty things to say with chalk.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/f\/5\/600_447946325.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>That said, creativity and artistic skills are not a requirement! We'll have a list of messages prepared to give you some ideas, and if you aren't quite sure what you want to write\/draw, you can assist someone else with their message or opt to just hand out leaflets.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/e\/600_448166414.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>While you can write or draw whatever you'd like, the general formula I like to use is:<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Short and sweet<\/p> <p>\u2022 Keep it positive!\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Include a clear vegan message (\"go vegan\" or \"choose vegan\") and a url that people can reference to learn more<\/p> <p>\u2022 Animal rights, environmental, or health focus<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/4\/6\/600_448166438.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Leafleting<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Leafleting is another super simple, effective way to spread the vegan message. Some activists from Farm Sanctuary and The Humane League completed a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veganoutreach.org\/LeafletingStudy.pdf\">survey<\/a> at two college campuses where Vegan Outreach leaflets had been distributed over the years, and the results revealed that of the 403 students that had received a leaflet during their academic careers, 7 became vegetarian, 50% changed their diet in some way, and about 20% gave their leaflet to a friend who then also changed his\/her diet!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/0\/1\/600_447946337.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>While leafleting may seem daunting at first, it is actually very fun and rewarding. The following are some tips to keep in mind:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Go to an area with heavy foot traffic<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 You can say things such as, \"Information on helping animals\/the environment\", \"Help animals\", \"Learn about where your food comes from\", \"Would you like\/did you get one of these?\", etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Smile! Sometimes just smiling and saying hello is enough for people to want to take a leaflet<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022 Extend your arm all the way out to the person<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Hand leaflet so that it\u2019s easy to reach<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Make eye contact<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0If you are nervous, feign confidence. Nervousness passes very quickly.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0If nobody is taking, try a brief pause. People mimic the actions they see others taking.<\/p> <p>While you will encounter people who are dismissive, you will also encounter people who are interested and will have the opportunity to engage in positive conversations. Focus on the good that is going to come out of the experience and don't let folks who seem uninterested deter you.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/4\/f\/f\/600_447946335.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We'll supply the chalk and leaflets, so you don't need to bring anything.<\/p> <p>Because we want a good couple of hours before dusk, our official start time is 5:30pm. I realize that might be early for many folks, so it's OK to come whenever you can. I'll post a phone number to the meetup on the day of the event, so you can text me to find us wherever we are.<\/p> <p>We'll chalk until it gets dark, which is around 7:30. Then we can optionally grab a vegan bite at a nearby establishment and discuss how awesome our chalk messages were.<\/p> <p>If you are not sure you are ready to leaflet and\/or chalk, please feel free to still join us and just hang out and learn. Maybe you'll be ready the next time!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0While we welcome all veg types, this event is about promoting veganism, so please remember to advocate for veganism when chalking and\/or speaking to others, even if you are not vegan.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let's get out there and be voices for animals!<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/b\/1\/600_448208881.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will be meeting outside of the PATH station entrance across from Texas Arizona near the bench.

This time let's take a deeper dive into the language, it's main features and how it extends the JavaScript programming language. We'll also look at how to use it to build a simple application and will discuss some lessons learned while building with it in production. We'll also be taking a look at Ionic 2.0, the newest version of the Ionic hybrid mobile development framework. Ionic 2.0 uses both TypeScript and Angular 2.0 so this talk will also serve as a continuation of the first talk as well a light introduction to ng2.

This male and female team (known as a group) will combine to bowl one 10 frame game. Remember, you are not bowling an entire game yourself. This is a group effort. A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane.

When vulnerability data changes upstream, the previous state and new state of the vulnerability along with the images they affect can be sent via webhook to a configured endpoint. All major components can be customized programmatically at compile-time without forking the project.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to enable a more transparent view of the security of container-based infrastructure. Thus, the project was named Clair\u00a0after the French term which translates to\u00a0clear,\u00a0bright,\u00a0transparent.<\/p> <p><b>Microservice Monitoring with Prometheus:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Prometheus is a next-generation monitoring system designed for microservices. This talk will look at what's the best way to monitor your microservices, which metrics you should care about, how to have useful alerts and how Prometheus empowers you to do things the right way.<\/p> <p><b>10 Questions to Answer Before Creating a \u00a0New Microservice:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Microservices might appear simple on the surface, but there\u2019s more to creating them than just launching some code running in a container and serving HTTP requests from it. This talk will cover 10 important questions that you should answer about any new microservice before development begins on it \u2013 and certainly before it gets deployed into production.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker Bios:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Jake Moshenko is the product manager for the Quay container registry at CoreOS, a Linux distribution with containers as a first-class citizen and software distribution channel. Formerly of Google, Amazon, and Boeing, he has been building robust distributed systems for over 10 years.<\/p> <p>Quentin Machu is an engineer on the Quay team at CoreOS. In addition to working on the Quay team at CoreOS, he is a maintainer of the Clair open source project, which scans containers for vulnerabilities. He is passionate about software engineering and distributed systems. Quentin completed an award-winning OpenStack project as part of his master\u2019s in computer engineering.<\/p> <p>Brian Brazil is a Irish core developer of Prometheus. He has over 10 years\u00a0experience managing and monitoring large-scale systems at companies such as\u00a0Google. He now uses his skills to help organisations get the most out their\u00a0systems and staff.<\/p> <p>Brian Kelly is VP Engineering at Datawire,\u00a0a company creating open source tools for building resilient microservices. Brian has spent over 20 years building software for technology companies. Prior to joining DataWire, he was VP of Engineering at TimeTrade, where he led their transformation from a monolithic to microservice-based architecture. He began his career with IONA Technologies, and managed the development of the Orbix middleware product, the world's most successful CORBA implementation. Later at Progress Software, he managed the development of the Sonic C++\/.NET high-performance messaging and integration products, and was involved in the development of the AMQP messaging standard.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/c\/e\/600_448407598.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/d\/c\/600_448407612.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/e\/3\/600_449131971.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/b\/9\/600_439054745.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/f\/8\/5\/600_435640837.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Microservices-NYC\/events\/230023492\/","yes_rsvp_count":78,"name":"Clair, Prometheus and Datawire","id":"230023492","time":1461796200000,"updated":1461850282000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424963725000,"name":"Microservices NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18462865,"urlname":"Microservices-NYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Microservers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Midtown Manhattan","address_2":"257 W39th St (bet 7th and 8th), 14th fl.

Migrate your codebase before its too late! by Sujan Kapadia (Chariot Solutions)\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>---------------------------------<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Don\u2019t block on it! Migrate your codebase before its too late!<\/b> \u00a0<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s face it - many of us regularly encounter (or may still be producing) code that performs blocking operations and doesn\u2019t play nicely with new \u201creactive\u201d libraries or fit well in the world of micro services. Most shops are either starting with existing code, integrating with legacy components, or even migrating Java code to Scala for example. In this talk, we\u2019ll go over various \u201cmundane\u201d techniques to introduce incremental changes that can make your software \u201cnon-blocking\u201d and \u201cevent driven\u201d. While Scala Futures and Akka actors will take center stage, we\u2019ll also cover topics such as functional error handling, monad transformers, thread pools, the circuit breaker pattern, non-blocking HTTP request handling, and briefly touch upon Akka Streams. These building blocks eventually lead to more advanced topics such as location transparency, micro services, and fully reactive APIs, but in my experience its necessary for teams to master the basics first.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Sujan<\/b><\/p> <p>Sujan Kapadia's 6th grade social studies teacher got him interested in programming and he\u2019s never looked back. He\u2019s spent the majority of his career developing enterprise and distributed software in Java for various industries. Sujan currently works for Chariot Solutions, where he\u2019s part of a team of Jedi knights that get to wield light sabers and travel the universe. Two years ago he decided to power up and add Scala to his arsenal. Scala is spreading fast, and he\u2019s used it for clients in telecom, e-commerce, and pharma. His current interests include machine learning, productivity hacks, and spending as much time as possible with his soon to be 4 year old daughter.<\/p> <p>-----------------<\/p> <p><b>Rethinking REST in a Microservices World with Lagom<\/b> \u00a0<\/p> <p>Many of us are doing microservices wrong. We\u2019re splitting our systems up into smaller and smaller services, paying all the costs that that entails, but only getting a taste of the benefits, and the problem is REST. Microservices are supposed to promise isolation, isolation from faults, isolation from load failures, but synchronous communication means failure and unresponsiveness bubbles back up through our services along our communication pathways, undermining the promises that microservices offer. To realize the full potential of microservices, we need to stop using REST as our go to, and start rethinking our architectures to use asynchronous communication. This presentation looks at how this can be achieved in a practical manner by using Lagom; a microservices framework from Lightbend.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Henrik<\/b><\/p> <p>After graduating with a M.Sc degree in Computer Science in 1998 at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm\/Sweden, Henrik has been working as a consultant up until his Lightbend (Typesafe) employment in 2011.

Fn is a beginner-and-advanced-friendly routing layer on top of the WAI interface. It's a web framework, but a pretty minimal one. Writing web code with Fn is as similar as possible to writing regular Haskell functions. Instead of having web handlers that are opaque monadic actions, the handler functions take arguments (query parameters, segments of the url, or even post bodies) and return responses. In this part of the talk, we'll learn a little bit about Haskell web development while writing a simple application with Fn.<\/p> <p>The second part of the talk will dive into how this url routing works. In particular, the `route` function takes a list of route patterns and functions with different numbers and types of arguments (that match the routes), something that's not obvious how to do in a statically typed language like Haskell. We'll look into how thinking in terms of continuations, a powerful programming technique with applications across disparate domains, can allow us to write this routing and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. The talk begins this exploration of continuations with the simpler example of a type-safe printf and builds up to the full routing that powers Fn currently.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Haskell\/events\/230142951\/","yes_rsvp_count":104,"duration":7200000,"name":"Web dev with Fn: typed URL routes using continuations","id":"230142951","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461863098000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1348521962000,"name":"New York Haskell Users Group","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":5087172,"urlname":"NY-Haskell","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Haskellers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11102","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"12-23 Astoria Boulevard","name":"Astor Bake Shop","lon":-73.929131,"id":11714942,"state":"NY","lat":40.772236,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.54361248016,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456356119000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us for a night of local talent.

By the end of this 8-week series, you will be equipped with all the necessary tools to make a seamless transition into the advanced level. *For those that register for Level 3, Levels 1 &amp; 2 are included as extra practice, free of charge, in your monthly package.*<\/p> <p>Sample Video: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSHUoyjfxlA<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Location<\/b>:<\/p> <p><b>Adelante Studios<\/b><br\/>25 W 31st Street between Broadway and 5th Avenue<br\/>2nd Floor<br\/><b>Grand Ballroom<\/b><\/p> <p>Nearby Subways: 34th St Station on B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, &amp; PATH trains.<\/p> <p>*Can't find our room?

Set in very contemporary New York, Los Angeles, and her native Cincinnati, Eligible brings the reader into the lives of Liz, a restless, 30-something magazine writer, and her yoga instructor older sister, Jane (another style of New York resident), who, when their father suffers a health scare, return together to Cincinnati. As they reenter the different milieus of their mother and three younger sisters, with a mixed bag of suitors popping up throughout, they inevitably make for unforgettable Sittenfeld characters caught up in funny and tender scenarios that honor and update Austen\u2019s classic.<\/p> <p><br\/>Following her reading, Sittenfeld will be joined for an interview by best-selling author (My Life in Middlemarch) and New Yorker staff writer Rebecca Mead.<\/p> <p>A book signing and informal reception will be held after the program.

With mutative design, things like physical ability, lighting, and vision are accounted for automatically, allowing interfaces to be engaging and accessible to every user, without compromise.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>This month's apps:<\/b><\/p> <p>InVision Viewer: <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/invision-viewer\/id990700027?mt=8\">iOS<\/a>\u00a0\/\u00a0InVision Labs: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invisionapp.com\/craft\">CRAFT<\/a><\/p> <p>Spark Camera: <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/spark-camera-capture-edit\/id649470858?mt=8\">iOS<\/a><\/p> <p>1 Second Everyday: <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=co.touchlab.android.onesecondeveryday\">Android<\/a>\u00a0\/ touchlab: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.touchlab.co\/blog\/2016\/3\/meet-selene\">Selene<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Twitter\u00a0accounts to follow:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InVisionApp\">@InVisionApp<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ideo\">@IDEO<\/a>\u00a0\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/touchlabNY\">@touchlabNY<\/a><\/p> <p><b>NYC Apps social accounts:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nycapps\">@nycapps<\/a>\u00a0\/\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23nycapps&amp;src=typd\">#nycapps<\/a><\/p> <p>Facebook page:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nycapps\">NYC Apps<\/a><\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there.<\/p> <p>-NYC Apps<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"#5 (floor)","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nycapps\/events\/230240687\/","yes_rsvp_count":50,"duration":7200000,"name":"InVision \/ IDEO \/ touchlab","id":"230240687","time":1461798000000,"updated":1462070389000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1279052728000,"name":"NYC Apps","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1674984,"urlname":"nycapps","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10003","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"125 E 11 Street (between 3rd Ave & 4th Ave)","name":"Webster Hall","lon":-73.990211,"id":8343482,"state":"NY","lat":40.731995,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.24680662155,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460075422000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ConcertGoers\/events\/230213197\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Halestorm, Lita Ford, & Dorothy","id":"230213197","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461809819000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1254967382000,"name":"NY Concert Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1536748,"urlname":"ConcertGoers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NY Live Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"140 East 27 Street (Lex - Third)","name":"Stone Creek Bar & Lounge","lon":-74.005974,"id":10617492,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458681480000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Due to a scheduling conflict, Wednesday's Great Lectures meeting is<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0CANCELLED.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sorry ... stuff happens.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shsny-org\/events\/229796720\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"SHSNY Great Lectures on DVD: CANCELLED","id":"229796720","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461809778000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1142136100000,"name":"Secular Humanist Society of New York","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":227880,"urlname":"shsny-org","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":21.5198497772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452780780000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dearest Beloveds,<\/p> <p>I am deeply honored and grateful to share this 10 month journey of The Path Of Love with each of you.<\/p> <p>The Path of Love opens you to the energy of creation and calls to you to open your heart gateway to your eternal self so that you may begin to anchor all that you are upon the Earth in unconditional love and open embrace of your Divinity.<\/p> <p>This is the creation dreaming path where you enter the void and begin to access your highest potential through an open heart.

Startup owners and employees usually don\u2019t count on fringe benefits that big corporations can provide. Also, most often their equity in the company is subject to all kinds of restrictions, their time with the company &amp; performance being just a few of them. At the same time should the business grow exponentially, how to make sure the taxes won\u2019t wipe out 50% of the profits as often is a case in the absence of careful preliminary planning. How can you ensure that your time with the company will not be wasted and you or your heirs will enjoy the benefits of your labor?

We had a great meet up this Sat 27th Feb, a good chin wag about AJ Fikry's Storied Life. I hope you enjoyed reading the books.<\/p> <p>Our next book has been selected: My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante<\/p> <p>'A modern masterpiece from one of Italy s most acclaimed authors, \"My Brilliant Friend\" is a rich, intense, and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Growing up on these tough streets the two girls learn to rely on each other ahead of anyone or anything else. As they grow, as their paths repeatedly diverge and converge, Elena and Lila remain best friends whose respective destinies are reflected and refracted in the other. They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists, the unforgettable Elena and Lila. Ferrante is the author of three previous works of critically acclaimed fiction: \"The Days of Abandonment, Troubling Love,\" and \"The Lost Daughter.\" With this novel, the first in a trilogy, she proves herself to be one of Italy s great storytellers. She has given her readers a masterfully plotted page-turner, abundant and generous in its narrative details and characterizations, that is also a stylish work of literary fiction destined to delight her many fans and win new readers to her fiction.\"<\/p> <p>I thought this time our meet could be week night evening meal so more people can make it.

What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.

This is the deal worked out with the owner. We will be in a much more centrally located area with more access to more subway lines.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Id-Tap-That-Brooklyn-Chapter-Casual-Magic-the-Gathering\/events\/230440787\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":21600000,"name":"Mid-week Magic MADNESS in Manhattan (well not really that mad)","id":"nbjkqlyvgblc","time":1461877200000,"updated":1461900310000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1357839413000,"name":"I'd Tap That - NYC Chapter (Casual Magic the Gathering)","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":6591412,"urlname":"Id-Tap-That-Brooklyn-Chapter-Casual-Magic-the-Gathering","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Tappers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10025","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"106th & Riverside Drive Field","address_2":"Enter at 103rd or 108th","lon":-73.968307,"name":"Riverside Park","id":489614,"state":"NY","lat":40.794983,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.31537675858,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450381177000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Updated March 7th, 2016<\/p> <p>Given the warmth that has descended upon NYC, I am making Tuesdays\/Thursdays active again, but at 5pm.<\/p> <p>This is one of three sites\/listserves that promotes weekly games that have been going on for many many years.

Our main location is Riverside Park, with Morningside and Booker T Washington as backups.<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Sundays at 12pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End - Where we can!)<\/p> <p>Damien<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T. WASHINGTON DETAILS<\/p> <p>This location is between 107th &amp; 108th Streets just West of Columbus Avenue. It's on the backside of the high school. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street.\u00a0<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather.

After receiving her degree in Marketing &amp; PR she moved to\u00a0<br\/>Athens to pursue acting. \u00a0She went on to co-star in two of the most\u00a0<br\/>successful soap operas in Greek TV history. Soon after she moved to New\u00a0<br\/>York to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.<\/p> <p>Ms. Toska refers to her meeting with Academy Award winner Olympia Dukakis\u00a0<br\/>as \"life changing\". The two collaborated on Toska\u2019s multi-award winning\u00a0<br\/>directorial debut, Beneath the Olive Tree, for which Dukakis served as\u00a0<br\/>Narrator and Executive Producer. The film is based on journals found\u00a0<br\/>buried on Trikeri; the Greek island that served as a concentration camp\u00a0<br\/>for thousands of women political exiles during the Greek civil war.<\/p> <p>In 2015 Ms. Toska produced Livin\u2019 The Dream, a comedic web series created\u00a0<br\/>by the Spurlock Sisters. The series takes a shot at the life of Kit\u00a0<br\/>Scanlon; a woman in her 30s who quits her job to pursue her dream of\u00a0<br\/>becoming an indie director goddess. Livin\u2019 The Dream went on to win\u00a0<br\/>multiple awards in the festival circuit. The team is now developing\u00a0<br\/>seasons 2 &amp; 3.<\/p> <p>Ms. Toska is currently producing A Photographic Memory; a deeply personal\u00a0<br\/>documentary film about a daughter\u2019s search for the mother she never\u00a0<br\/>knew through their shared love of photography, directed by Rachel\u00a0<br\/>Elizabeth Seed.

The influences of Mercury Retrograde occurs when it is moving backwards, into its shadow, and thus communication, scheduling, electrical devices, transportation and judgment becomes effected. As Mercury Retrograde creates challenges in our outer reality it also contronts on how we react to those challenges in our inner reality. Most of us encounter these challenges when we are not aware or conscious of what is going on around us. When we are not acting from our heart and spirit. Instead we react from our needs, our hurts, or from our buttons being pushed. In that way we act from our shadow, and that is what mercury retrograde is all about. It becomes the perfect time to bring healing to our issues<\/p> <p>With the power of the Merlin\u2019s Grace we will bring deep healing and transformation to the many levels Mercury Retrograde brings up. I first start by invoking what is called the Planetary Puja. I will encompass all participants in a grid of divine healing essence. I invoke the puja and from there the divine grid will heal all negativity and disharmonious influences that are occurring within your astrological chart. I then channel the Merlin\u2019s Grace divine healing essence to bring healing on all levels and dimension to the specific issues that Mercury Retrograde confronts. This is accompanied by a karmic healing that will bring a powerful acceleration to any karmic issues that may also occur during the retrograde. With this group healing your receive a powerful advantage of healing acceleration, awareness and deep clarity that you carry with you all throughout the retrograde. Please join me to discover new and incredible astrological healing possibilities!<\/p> <p>Admission: $35<\/p> <p>www.simondeacon.com<\/p> <p>You may bring your cell phones, laptops, or any other electrical devices into the group healing so they be energetically strengthened and protected. \u00ae \u201cVortexHealing\" is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun.

It also occasionally explores classics and the 'masters' of the classics.<\/p> <p><i>Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell<\/i>\u00a0by Susanna Clarke<\/p> <p>English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory. But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr. Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French. All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr. Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear. Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England.<\/p> <p>(Blame Todd for this)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/science-fiction-society-northern-nj\/events\/225805363\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Modern Masters:  Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke","id":"jxvfllyvgblc","time":1461888000000,"updated":1461912259000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1233007408000,"name":"The Science Fiction Society of Northern New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1500015259,"id":1367789,"urlname":"science-fiction-society-northern-nj","group_lat":41.0699996948,"who":"SF\/Fantasy Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"123 4th Avenue, 2nd floor, Manhattan","name":"CRS Studios","lon":-73.989639,"id":24375255,"state":"NY","lat":40.732967,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.17952418327,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459353629000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/6\/e\/600_446980302.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Had a baby in the past 12 months?
