Session!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>An Open Play\/Clinic! What\u2019s that?.<\/b>.......<b>It is our unique creation! Three hours of Open Play and Clinic combined! Here\u2019s how it works. 3 teams of 8 players each alternate playing games on one of our 2 main courts at Brandeis H.S. (84th st. bet Columbus &amp; Amsterdam) Now get this, while the third team is out, instead of sitting around, that team gets a clinic (8 players to one coach) on our back court at Brandeis with a top instructor. When the two teams finish their game on the main court, one comes off for instruction. Meanwhile, the players that just received instruction take what they just learned and use it in the next game. This rotation continues for 3 hrs! It is a great way to meet new players and improve your skills at the same time. \u00a0It is an absolutely unbelievable deal!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>***Please note- RSVP'g on Meetup will not reserve your spot.\u00a0Please go to our website to sign up.*** A credit card payment is required to reserve your space.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/nyurban.com\/open-play-registration-vb\/?filter_id=1&amp;gametypeid=1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nyurban.com\/open-play-registration-vb\/?filter_id=1&amp;gametypeid=1<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/3\/4\/event_198656372.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/4\/4\/event_198112292.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYURBAN-Volleyball\/events\/226467333\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"SATURDAY AFTERNOON OPEN PLAY\/CLINIC (Beginner\/Adv Beg & Intermediate)","id":"pqrhklytpbkb","time":1446920100000,"updated":1446932642000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1352757933000,"name":"NY URBAN PROFESSIONALS VOLLEYBALL LEAGUE","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":5817922,"urlname":"NYURBAN-Volleyball","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Volleyball Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"8 E 36th St","name":"Slattery's Midtown Pub","lon":-73.982933,"id":23826271,"lat":40.749439,"repinned":false},"headcount":51,"distance":0.372470378876,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445106425000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>75+ members once again attended our last Scavenger Hunt!\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Amazing Wine Scavenger Hunt is part hunt, part obstacle course &amp; ALL FUN!

Her studies explore the biological mechanisms of memory consolidation and reconsolidation, the processes by which newly learned information become long-lasting memories, and how memories are modulated and integrated into complex behavioral manifestations. Her studies also aim at utilizing the basic understandings of the mechanisms of memory formation to enhance memories and prevent forgetting, or disrupt pathogenic memories. Both approaches have important translational applications.<\/p> <p>She graduated from the University of Pavia in Italy with Honors and obtained a Doctorate in Research in Immunological Sciences from the University of Genoa in Italy.

Each month a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed and debated. This group, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Freemasons.<\/p> <p><b>Study Topic<\/b><br\/>November's topic will be conducted by Brother Plinio Butten on a study of Freemasonry: Can reality be understood for what it is without being affected by individual perception? After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.<\/p> <p>Reality is a fluid concept and what we see as real is just a perception based on our beliefs and personality. The world we see is a reflection of who we are. Can reality be understood without being transformed into what we think it should be? is perception more important than reality? Is reality connected to perception and cannot be understood without being transformed into what we think it is? Freemasonry teaches the importance of being open to change and with that the opportunity to change our reality.<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education. We further embrace the concept of a community environment, where ideas can be shared and debated in an open forum.

The material that makes up the road is <b>everything <\/b>that's within you... and therefore\u00a0the\u00a0road you pave is always yours to choose.\u00a0<\/p> <p>What within you have you transcended already to grow to who and where you are today? What within you do you still need to transform to take you to the next level, to live an <i>even better <\/i>version of that?\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What current life path are you on... and more importantly, what life path do you WANT to be living?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>I will tell you this much, the distance between those two are closer than you think.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Come join us on Saturday afternoon to kickstart a very life-changing journey together where the \"yellow brick road\" you choose from here on is a golden, accelerated one.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please bring:<\/p> <p><br\/>- A notebook and pen (if you wish)<\/p> <p>- Water<\/p> <p>- An open mind, an open heart, and a huge smile. :)<\/p> <p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to send me a message through meetup or email me at [masked].

If you are a \"maybe\" please indicate that via the comment section with a brief explanation (ie 80% chance I'll be there...). If you RSVP and are then unable to attend, please update your RSVP as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>What is Ultimate Frisbee? In a nutshell &lt;borrowed from Wiki&gt; :<\/p> <p>Ultimate is a limited-contact team field sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee. You do not need to be an expert frisbee player\/thrower etc. - it's all about having fun.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Fit-Club\/events\/226457523\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"Saturday Ultimate Frisbee (Anderson Park)","id":"zffmllytpbkb","time":1446926400000,"updated":1446935922000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1393688588000,"name":"North Jersey Fit Club","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":13120942,"urlname":"North-Jersey-Fit-Club","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":7,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14227032661,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440371351000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"3 and UP","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Saturday from 3:00 to 4:00 PM - Advanced level<\/p> <p>$15 from 2 to 3 people - $10 from 4 to 6 people<\/p> <p>You need to register prior to coming.<\/p> <p>This is an advanced meeting!

Every musical and dramatic work takes its audience on a journey, generally consisting of the following elements:<\/p> <p>1-) Introduction and elaboration: The central melodic theme is introduced and often repeated, in identical fashion or with variation. The mood of the piece is presented and established via use of dynamics, tempo and melodic arc.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> draw in the audience at this point, either with a compelling narrative subtext, or strong emotional message. Also, the performer must build gradual tension (when applicable), leading the audience to the musical <i>climax<\/i>.<\/p> <p>2-) Climax: The highest emotional point of the work, usually occurring 2\/3 to \u00be into the piece. Requires maximum expression and melodic emphasis to evoke a desired reaction or response from the audience. Also considered a reward point, or tension release for the audience.<\/p> <p><i>The performer should<\/i> fully understand the climactic point of the piece, and clearly highlight this point via the use of tone, dynamic expression and musical touch. The importance of the climax for audience understanding and satisfaction cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>3-) Resolution: The conclusion of the piece, during which all unresolved musical elements are resolved in a decisive manner.<\/p> <p><i>The performer must<\/i> prepare the audience for the eventual end of the musical journey, a return to reality. Musical cues which aid this transition include:<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 gradual decrescendo and diminuendo<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 a clear a decisive \u00a0end point , so as to not leave the audience with an uneasy feeling of something unresolved<\/p> <p>Entertain your audience: Great entertainers (actors, singers, etc.) put their unique personality into every performance. If you want to make a memorable impression upon your audience, introduce a new, unique perspective on your piece. Once you truly own your piece, it should carry the inimitable stamp of your personality, but also <i>sound as if it is being performed for the first time<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Select pieces that are personally meaningful to you, and allow for your maximum expression as both performer and entertainer.<\/p> <p>Performances do not have to be memorized, or note-perfect. However, as a courtesy to your audience, please present a work that you have studied attentively, and can play to its completion.<\/p> <p>If you make a mistake during your performance, <i>please continue to play without stopping<\/i>. Apologizing, repeating a previously played section, or stopping will only call more attention to your mistake.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"website: www.nycclassical.com, email: acma@nycclassical.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/classical-139\/events\/226020851\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":7200000,"name":"ACMA November 2015 Concert","id":"226020851","time":1446930000000,"updated":1446938290000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202513261000,"name":"Amateur Classical Musicians Association","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1001619,"urlname":"classical-139","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Classical Music Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10028","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1000 5th Ave","name":"Met Museum - Ruth and Harold D Uris Center For Education, 81st Street Plaza Entrance","lon":-73.962929,"id":15718592,"state":"NY","lat":40.779167,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.46817660332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1379180734000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's explore the Met together every other Saturday with as little pressure as possible.<\/p> <p>Go in the 81st entrance (not up the big stairs), and head straight back to the Uris Center for Education.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

In the tradition of Spud Webb, anyone under 5'8\", male or female, is welcome to join us on the court. We'll get some teams together and play some competitive, but relaxed bball-- and without any giant hands in our faces! :-p<\/p> <p>We rent out the gym from 5:00-8:00pm. Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm. (If you get there late, please only ring the bell once. It is very loud! And it takes us a few minutes to get downstairs.)

Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs. Subs should enter mid-game (one of the teams reaches 6 points) and should start the following game.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

I am thinking HOLIDAY SEASON is just around the corner.<\/p> <p>As such, I am inviting you to a beautiful\u00a0Share\u00a0Your Holistic Products and Services Networking\u00a0event! This is to take place at Graphic Eye Art Gallery, 402 Main Street, Port Washington,\u00a0from 6pm to 8:30pm on Saturday, November 7th. The Art\u00a0Gallery is right across from Inspiration Wharf. Park at the Town Dock or at the Wharf.<\/p> <p>Share your products and services with us at our Sharing Circle which will begin promptly at 6:15pm! Thank you for arriving at 6pm.<\/p> <p>Tell us what you do and why you are passionate about what you do. Ask for referrals and give referrals. Bring sample products and\u00a0gift certificates\u00a0as we are nearing holiday season!<\/p> <p>I personally am excited to share my\u00a0Eucalyptus,\u00a0 Healthy,\u00a0Luxurious, Sustainable, Living Fresh Collection bedding products (Sheet Sets, Pillows, Duvets, Blankets, Towels, etc.) with you. They are hypoallergenic, antimicrobial and just beautiful. Great for everyone, but particularly helpful to those with allergies, asthma, night sweats and skin conditions.<\/p> <p>I am also excited that my VP of Business Development and Life Coach, Randi Farina will be presenting to us about the LFC products and opportunity.\u00a0Randi will also be presenting on The Importance of Goal Setting, and also What Holds People Back from Living the Lives of Their Dreams. She will be available for mini- individual consults on\u00a0this topic!<\/p> <p>I spent three days with Randi at an amazing LFC conference in Fort Lauderdale recently.

It is the barrier between our ordinary and mundane world and an anticipated event of the virtual world of theatre. At the same time it divides the space with a passive position of the viewer from the space of the stage where the artistic process takes place. The curtain conceals, divides and determines the space. In many instances we perceive it as a two-dimensional blind that obstructs vision, not different from a sleepy screen of a computer or closed eyes.<\/p> <p>Contemporary artists, just like their performative activities, often oscillate on the borderline between the mundane world around them and an artificially determined field of creative process. One of many possible ways how to define this is to use a medium of video. Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 uses video especially in this sense. In many of her works, like in the presented one, the video frame reflects the space of artist`s passive presence confronted with a given environment, rather than a theatre stage for an active performance.<\/p> <p>Here an analogy between the theatre space and artist`s activities is fully expressed by the author. The particular videos capture the artists performing on the proscenium of various theatres. She stands exactly on the imaginary borderline where the stage curtain opens or closes or is lowered and raised. The artist is in a literal physical contact with the curtain in these situations. A minimalist straightforwardness of the performance itself is contrasted by pathos of theatre environment. Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 might at first glance present her body as an object, but standing on the borderline of the stage and auditorium proves how important the value of own experience is to her.<\/p> <p>The stage curtain is a three-dimensional actor as well as a spatial object. Simultaneously, it serves as a metaphor for a relationship between an artist and reality, where the intersection between the ordinary and the imagination becomes the matter of physicality.<\/p> <p>Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1 (born 1979 in Lu\u010denec, Slovakia ) lives and works in Prague, Czech Republic. She obtained her BFA from the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and her MFA from the University of Newcastle. She has had residencies at the Museum Quartier, Donumenta Regensburg, and the ISCP. Gaberova has exhibited at the Pradelna Bohnice (Czech Republic), Umelka Gallery (Slovakia), Approach Art Association (Hungary), and Oi Futuro (Brazil) among others.<\/p> <p>Text by Viktor \u010cech. \u010cech is a curator, art historian, and professor at Charles University in Prague.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceGallery\/events\/226373046\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"OPENING RECEPTION: Mira G\u00e1berov\u00e1's \"Statue of Everything\"","id":"226373046","time":1446940800000,"updated":1446949846000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442518768000,"name":"Open Source Gallery","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":18941888,"urlname":"OpenSourceGallery","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445968354000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/5\/5\/600_443544661.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Find Your Healing Path<\/p> <p>\u00a0Every one of us is on this Earth to make a specific contribution or to fulfill a certain task.

Some of those haunted places just happen to be some of the oldest bars in the city. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelandmarktavern.org\/\">The Landmark Tavern<\/a>, a Hell's Kitchen fixture since at least 1866, is one of those places.<\/p> <p>The upscale Irish pub, once the haunt of longshoremen and the Westies Irish-American street gang, has seen its share of shady characters over the years. And some of them have stuck around. The pub is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former Confederate soldier who died there after being stabbed to death in a fight shortly after the Civil War. He frequently removes books from the bookshelf of the second floor party room and the bathtub he was said to have died in remains.<\/p> <p>Another frequent ghost siting is that of a 19th century Irish girl who died of cholera or typhoid fever. But her spirit continues to wander around the building's third floor.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/2\/0\/600_292196352.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Even the ghost of Hollywood actor George Raft, who played the heavy in a number of 1930s gangster movies, is said to make an occasional appearance. Raft grew up in Hell's Kitchen in the early 20th century and was a frequent patron of the Landmark throughout his adult life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This meetup is definitely not for the faint of heart. ;-) But if you can stand a good scare, please join us for a fun-filled night.
