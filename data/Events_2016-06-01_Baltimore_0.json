After wowing on Broadway, The Roundabout Theatre Company's Tony-winning dazzler is heading out on a huge North American tour, bringing the scandalous surround of the gaudy Kit Kat Klub of pre-war Berlin to your door!<\/p> <p>First appearing on The Great White Way in 1966, Cabaret is based on writer Christopher Isherwood's time in the bohemian clubs of Berlin in the early 1930s. With decadence and sexual exploration being the first orders of business, Caberet tells the story of one Sally Bowles, a daring femme fatale in training, and her new room-mate, the shy runaway Cliff. On a mission to experience every sight and sound, Cliff follows Sally to the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy underground cabaret club presided over by the all-knowing Emcee.<\/p> <p>But whilst the night goes on forever inside, the music is not loud enough to cover the ever growing voice of fascism, as Nazi ideals seep into the city, and eventually the club itself.<\/p> <p>With music and lyrics by John Kander and Fred Ebb, book by Joe Masteroff and Direction from Sam Mendes, this wildly entertaining musical thrills easily, as the narrative takes on ever more terrifying subject matter. Cabaret is an absolute must see!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/1\/d\/600_448340765.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/annapoliscultureclub\/events\/229949052\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Broadway Across America: Cabaret","id":"229949052","time":1462122000000,"updated":1462134574000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388623277000,"name":"Annapolis Culture Club","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":11675792,"urlname":"annapoliscultureclub","group_lat":39,"who":"Well-rounded individuals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Glen Burnie","address_1":"7489 Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard","name":"Redemption House Life Center","lon":-76.623352,"id":24053767,"state":"MD","lat":39.164028,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.72347164154,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446386245000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Note new location &amp; time.<\/i>\u00a0 This meetup will repeat on the 1st Sunday of each month from 1pm to 2:30PM<\/b><\/p> <p>This meetup will be held\u00a0at:\u00a0 Redemption House Life Center, 7489 Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard, Glen Burnie, Md.\u00a0 Park along the street or in the free parking garage across the street.\u00a0 <b>There is also\u00a0parking at the rear door of the church at 133 Delaware Avenue, Glen Burnie: this is the most convenient option - park near the rear door and enter through the rear door of the church.<\/b><\/p> <p>90-minute meetup.\u00a0 <b>We will read\u00a0Leviticus 6-8 &amp; Luke 13-14.\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>We'll have a\u00a0discussion about our readings (and any other subjects that members want to discuss, including prayer requests), sing hymns, and have coffee and fellowship.<\/p> <p>Note: immediately after this meetup, at 2:30pm, is the afternoon service at this church.\u00a0 You are all welcome to stay for this exciting evangelical service.<\/p> <p>Going forward, we'll continue our readings and discussions as we continue book by book through the Old and New Testaments.<\/p> <p>We look forward to meeting you all!

Everything in physical existence first began from a blueprint on at least the mental level and even higher (ie. causal, spiritual, divine levels).\u00a0 For example, the chair you are sitting on once existed as an idea.\u00a0 Someone took that idea and allowed it to come through all the way down onto the physical plane where he designed and produced the chair.\u00a0 The same idea also exists for our physical body.\u00a0 This activation allows this divine idea or blueprint from these higher and more subtle levels to more clearly and easily manifest in the physical dimension in its complete form.<\/p> <p>The second encoding, the Arcturian Neural Net (ANN), works directly with the nervous tissue of each person making it more porous and open to subtle fluctuations coming from the subtle bodies.\u00a0 This activation develops the nervous system so that it can transmit and bring to conscious awareness more that is going on in the subtle planes of existence.\u00a0 The nervous system is the transmitter through which the subtle dimensions first affect the physical body.<\/p> <p>The third encoding, the Arcturian Endocrine Activation (AEA), upgrades the endocrine system and its glands so that the entire physical body is functioning at a higher attuned level.\u00a0 The endocrine system is the long-term physiological mechanism keeping the body in health.\u00a0 By upgrading this system, people can handle more light, energy, and consciousness without burning out the physical body.\u00a0 Also, this light and energy can be transmitted through the physical body on a long-term healthy basis.<\/p> <p>In addition, this class teaches and activates in each participant the capacity to apply the Arcturian Healing Light attuned in Level 1 to healing at the cellular level.\u00a0 An attunement, archetypes, and protocols will be learned to heal at the cell level.\u00a0 This is also the basis for further training on using the Arcturian Healing Light and other tools to heal on the DNA level which will be presented in Level 3.<\/p> <p>A summary of what is include in this class is the following:<\/p> <p>-3 Encodings: the Arcturian Blueprint Activation (ABA), the Arcturian Nervous System Activation (ANN), the Arcturian Endocrine Activation (AEA)<\/p> <p>-Capacity to facilitate the 3 activations for others<\/p> <p>-Cellular Repatterning\/Reprogramming<\/p> <p>-Healing using the first platform of energy (1st POE) above the head<\/p> <p>-Spin technique for soul retrieval\/trauma healing and soul stealing<\/p> <p>-Spin technique for self-development<\/p> <p>-Spin technique for disintegrating unwanted elementals<\/p> <p>-Advanced Arcturian Symbol\/Stargate<\/p> <p>-Arcturian Healing Chamber<\/p> <p>-Working with consciousness and healing frequencies of whales<\/p> <p>-Arcturian Healing Program<\/p> <p>-Included is 45-page workbook<\/p> <p>There will be a series of 4 attunements (45 minutes each) given in this course.\u00a0 You can bring a blanket, yoga mat, pillow, and\/or eye covering for these attunements.<\/p> <p><b>Course requirement:\u00a0 Arcturian Healing Method Level 1<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Investment: $350 Credit Card accepted or write check made out to: Nourishing Journey. \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Send to: Nourishing Journey \u00a010440 Shaker Drive Suite 105 Columbia, MD 21046 or use online payment: (Or register payment):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/nourishing-journey.com\/journey\/event-registration\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nourishing-journey.com\/journey\/event-registration\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/nourishing-journey.com\/journey\/event-registration\/<\/a><\/a><br\/><\/b>**(click on drop down arrow to select workshop)<\/p> <p><b>For more info: [masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/5\/c\/event_109745212.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Gene Ang, Ph.D. has a healing practice based in Thousand Oaks, California and sees clients for Reconnective Healing, the Reconnection, Pranic Healing, Vortex Healing, and Shamanic Healing.

Now maybe I see someone at the mall or out shopping or random other places. It seems we gather at birthdays mostly. But I have been wanting to plan a reunion for the 2013 moms and their kids. Can you believe our babies are 3 or almost 3. This moms night out is a chance for us to gather flip through our busy calendars that are now already filled through December it seems and maybe mark a nice day to try to put together a reunion with the kids. Not a birthday party just a happy gathering of people who joined here once back in 2013. I know it is hard to meet as I went back to work last year myself and I think I rarely even logged in to meetup myself. I put Sylvie at the helm and disappeared. I am only home now because of my 2nd child and that time is slipping away faster than I could ever imagine. My 2nd child turns one in May. The baby year has gone too quick and I too will get busy again. I would like also to create an email list of those who want to stay connected. So even if you can't get out of the house for an evening which I totally understand as my husband and I jockey for time if you are interested in a continued connection please send me your email address as I'd like to start a group email list for 2013 moms. I'm considering making a facebook group (I'm so anti-facebook but I might have to cave) so we can stay connected in other ways as face to face might be few and far between. If other mom's have ideas like a monthly weekend park meetup for the older kids as a way to have face to face interaction with the kids. Or another idea. Please think some things up to share. Meetup, while worth while in the early years when many of us were home proves difficult as time moves on.<\/p> <p>You have to help me select a day and time for this meetup as we are all busy. But RSVP if you are interested in coming, and message me your email address if you are interested in staying connected.

In addition, he teaches a number of seminars that focus on the integration of science, spirituality, and healing. Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\">www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donuts driveway: Nourishing Journey, LLC is behind Dunkin Donuts, 3rd doorway on the right","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/229114560\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":9000000,"name":"The School of Archangel Michael","id":"229114560","time":1462314600000,"updated":1462401416000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion in Towson","lon":-76.603523,"id":716307,"state":"MD","lat":39.396397,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.41901063919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461439086000,"fee":{"amount":18,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person per 1.5 hr","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Start Dancing Here for Weddings, Fundraisers, Friday Night Dances,<\/b><\/p> <p><b> and just fun!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We make our Beginning Classes easy and enjoyable, even if you\u2019ve never danced with a partner!<\/p> <p><br\/><b><i>No Partners or Experience Necessary!\u00a0<\/i> However, more people means more practice, so please invite friends! <\/b>The more people you know in this Class the more fun you will have!\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Learn Basic Slow Dancing\u00a0 and the most popular Social Ballroom Dances:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Fox-Trot, Waltz, Cha-Cha, Rumba &amp; Tango<\/i>.<\/b><i> (Yes, You will be dancing in 4 weeks)<\/i><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meet up with Friends &amp; Very Nice People and Take This Famous BEGINNING Ballroom Survival Classes.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

Gene travels around the United States facilitating healing sessions and workshops.<\/p> <p>Gene received his BA from Stanford in Human Biology and Philosophy\/Religious Studies, and was formally trained as a Neurobiologist at Yale where he earned his doctorate in basic mechanisms of how the brain develops followed by a post-doctoral fellowship on how ultrasound can affect the developing cerebral cortex.<\/p> <p>After his post-doctoral fellowship, Gene decided to step into the role of a facilitator of healing in order to directly interact with helping people.<\/p> <p>Most of his work centers around the use of subtle energy to help align the subtle energy body, its channels, meridians, and energy centers to help restore balance and harmony so that healing can occur whether it be physical, emotional, mental, and\/or spiritual.<\/p> <p>Gene doesn't see himself as the healer but simply as part of the interconnectedness that occurs when facilitator, client, and Source\/Love\/God interact to bring healing forth. He sees his teaching engagements and seminars as an extension of this interaction that occurs on multiple dimensions to bring wholeness and understanding to all involved.<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geneang.com\">www.geneang.com<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donuts driveway: Nourishing Journey, LLC is behind Dunkin Donuts, 3rd doorway on the right","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/229114662\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":9000000,"name":"Non-Dual Healing with Gene Ang, Ph.D.","id":"229114662","time":1462401000000,"updated":1462413337000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Crofton","address_1":"1053 Maryland Route 3 North","name":"Molloy's Irish Pub","lon":-76.687248,"id":24337970,"state":"MD","lat":39.027058,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":18.5590572357,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454249454000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We have gone to a trivia night before when it was still The Irish Channel. \u00a0Now its a new restaurant with a new name (Molloy's Irish Pub) and a new pub trivia (hosted by Geeks Who Drink) at\u00a06:30 PM.\u00a0 Trivia starts at 7:00 PM, but this will give us time to get seated and order food and drinks.\u00a0 Unlike some pub trivia quizzes, this is limited to teams of six so with a larger group we will just need to split up.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's a link to the menu at Molloy's:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/molloysirishpub.com\/menu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/molloysirishpub.com\/menu\/<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet near the entrance before the trivia starts and try to get to a table in time to place food and drink orders before the trivia begins.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boardgames-543\/events\/228497060\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Trivia at Molloy's Irish Pub","id":"228497060","time":1462401000000,"updated":1462435799000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1207503530000,"name":"The Anne Arundel Boardgames Meetup","group_lon":-76.6800003052,"id":1099209,"urlname":"boardgames-543","group_lat":39.0099983215,"who":"Game Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Owing Mills ","phone":"443-738-3600","address_1":"90 Painters Mills Road Suite 220","name":"Painters Mill Executive Park","lon":-76.641273,"id":1001085,"state":"MD","lat":39.045753,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.9488067627,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420592393000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/e\/7\/600_433119143.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us each month and meet with your fellow investors to talk about the ups and downs of the rental business.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you're new to rentals or just thinking about this type of investing, you're sure to learn a great deal about the many ways to make (and lose) money.<\/p> <p>You can shorten your learning curve by talking to those who've already \"been there, done that.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>FREE for Meetup Members ( 1st time only) and MAREIA members--otherwise $20.00<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MAREIA\/events\/230544614\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Landlord Discussion Group","id":"hxsndlyvhbgb","time":1462401000000,"updated":1462409924000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1246459386000,"name":"Mid-Atlantic Real Estate Investors Assoc.

But exploring that intersection between integrity and intrigue has always been central to this idiosyncratic musician's appeal. That, in turn, has culminated in her latest release, '99\u00a2' (out January 22, 2016), an often-playful satire on the singer's \"brand.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"The '99\u00a2' album cover features me shrink-wrapped among a cluttered mess of things -- my life in a bag,\" she explains. \"It is about how everything is a packaged product for sale: how we package ourselves, our lives, our relationships.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>We first heard Santigold's outspoken, unmistakable voice in 2008 on her vibrant self-titled debut featuring the singles \"L.E.S. Artistes\" and \"Creator,\" both takedowns about authenticity that won praises from Rolling Stone and Pitchfork alike. Her follow-up, the darker 'Master of My Make-Believe' -- its centerpiece, the post-punk anthem \"Disparate Youth\" -- hit both Billboard's Dance\/Electronic and Top 200 charts upon its release. Where to go from there?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"When I got off the 'Master of My Make-Believe' tour, I got home and said, 'I want to do something completely different,\"' she says. So she created a post-apocalyptic makeup line for Smashbox, designed head-tripping socks for Stance, and popped-up in acting gigs on \"The Office\" and Adult Swim's \"NTSF:SD:SUV::.\" \"I think if I hadn't done all that,\" she says, \"I wouldn't have been prepared to do more music.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>She also spent time with her new son, who's responsible for much of '99\u00a2's markedly sunnier disposition. \"He kinda forces me to go with the flow. That's completely, absolutely the opposite of my natural tendency,\" she says, laughing. That new perspective is evident right from the album's optimistic, lilting opening track, \"Can't Get Enough of Myself.\" \"I was very careful to write lyrics that were bright and worked really hard on that,\" adds Santigold. \"It sometimes doesn't come easy to me, because my sense of humor can get dark.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>It took roughly eight months to manifest her new vision, with assists from a mix of collaborators with poppier visions such as producers Patrick Berger (Robyn, Icona Pop) and John Hill (Florence and the Machine, Charli XCX), alongside eclectic talents known more for globe-trotting sounds such as Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij and TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek. She went into the studio with them intending to make a fun record. \"My last record had a seriousness to it,\" she says. \"This time around, it's more playful -- but still a commentary.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>'99\u00a2' came together primarily in New York City and Los Angeles, with a stint in Jamaica, where Santigold likes to do her lyrical heavy-lifting. \"I have a place there in a tropical forest, with a balcony overlooking endless trees, and in the horizon, the ocean,\" she says. \"You get up at seven in the morning, and the lyrics just pour out.\" Her vantage may have shifted, but '99\u00a2' remains grounded in her aural anchors: bold rhythms, glitched-out melodies, and morphing global sounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buoyancy was important to her, but so was capturing a depth of sounds and emotions. As such, life-affirming exhortations like the African-beatific \"Banshee\" and the new-wave \"Rendezvous Girl\" coexist alongside ethereal, existential tracks such as \"Chasing Shadows,\" \"Before the Fire\" (co-written with indie-soul artist Sam Dew), and \"Walking in a Circle.\" The latter \"was about how I sometimes feel as an artist in this climate. Feeling stuck,\" she says. \"It's about this struggle to find a fun place.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>Today, any of her dissents veer toward the contemplative. \"I wanted to write some songs that felt very personal,\" she says. \"Before Santigold, in my other band, I used to write songs like journal entries. And I tried to write a couple of songs on this record where it was really about me and my experience.\" Though, in true Santigold form, she balances the introspective moments with humorous ones in songs like \"Who Be Loving Me,\" a lighthearted boast about fan adoration, produced by Zeds Dead and featuring ILoveMakonnen.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"You could go around being annoyed all the time, or you can go, 'This is crazy and actually funny.' Then you can play around with it, and make great art,\" she says. \"This album has required me to be more open, less of a perfectionist.\" Ironically, that's made the prismatic '99\u00a2' her most ambitious album to date. \"I realize that my work is a collage,\" she says. \"And I can pretty much take that anywhere.\"\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Will send out where we are & what we are wearing.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Baltimore-Club\/events\/230741332\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Santigold @ Baltimore Soundstage in Baltimore, MD","id":"230741332","time":1462402800000,"updated":1462415243000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1418954032000,"name":"Baltimore Social Club","group_lon":-76.5699996948,"id":18261987,"urlname":"The-Baltimore-Club","group_lat":39.2999992371,"who":"foodies,enthusiast,well rounded"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"3700 O'Donnell Street, Suite 100","name":"New AOL Building","lon":-76.565918,"id":23747207,"state":"MD","lat":39.280602,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":120,"headcount":0,"distance":2.97059726715,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428508466000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We've been ccjs-ing for a whole year!!

But exploring that intersection between integrity and intrigue has always been central to this idiosyncratic musician's appeal. That, in turn, has culminated in her latest release, '99\u00a2' (out January 22, 2016), an often-playful satire on the singer's \"brand.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"The '99\u00a2' album cover features me shrink-wrapped among a cluttered mess of things -- my life in a bag,\" she explains. \"It is about how everything is a packaged product for sale: how we package ourselves, our lives, our relationships.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>We first heard Santigold's outspoken, unmistakable voice in 2008 on her vibrant self-titled debut featuring the singles \"L.E.S. Artistes\" and \"Creator,\" both takedowns about authenticity that won praises from Rolling Stone and Pitchfork alike. Her follow-up, the darker 'Master of My Make-Believe' -- its centerpiece, the post-punk anthem \"Disparate Youth\" -- hit both Billboard's Dance\/Electronic and Top 200 charts upon its release. Where to go from there?\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"When I got off the 'Master of My Make-Believe' tour, I got home and said, 'I want to do something completely different,\"' she says. So she created a post-apocalyptic makeup line for Smashbox, designed head-tripping socks for Stance, and popped-up in acting gigs on \"The Office\" and Adult Swim's \"NTSF:SD:SUV::.\" \"I think if I hadn't done all that,\" she says, \"I wouldn't have been prepared to do more music.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>She also spent time with her new son, who's responsible for much of '99\u00a2's markedly sunnier disposition. \"He kinda forces me to go with the flow. That's completely, absolutely the opposite of my natural tendency,\" she says, laughing. That new perspective is evident right from the album's optimistic, lilting opening track, \"Can't Get Enough of Myself.\" \"I was very careful to write lyrics that were bright and worked really hard on that,\" adds Santigold. \"It sometimes doesn't come easy to me, because my sense of humor can get dark.\"\u00a0<\/p> <p>It took roughly eight months to manifest her new vision, with assists from a mix of collaborators with poppier visions such as producers Patrick Berger (Robyn, Icona Pop) and John Hill (Florence and the Machine, Charli XCX), alongside eclectic talents known more for globe-trotting sounds such as Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij and TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek.

Join me for some wellness laughter at the Ruscombe Mansion Yoga Room where we will fill the space with vibrant laughter energy! ----------<\/p> <p>New to Laughter Yoga? Laughter Yoga is not a fad.<\/p> <p>Laughter Yoga is celebrating it's 21st Anniversary this year and is practiced in 105 countries and at over 6000 laughter clubs.<\/p> <p>LY is the combination of laughter exercises + deep yoga breathing+mindfulness meditation.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/7\/9\/600_449480601.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nNO YOGA POSES- but don't worry, this is still considered an aerobic workout. That said, all the exercises are very easy to follow, NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. You will burn calories, you will give your diaphragm a good work out and you will leave feeling great, no exaggeration.<\/p> <p>We practice laughing for the sake of laughing to benefit our health. We don't use comedy or jokes to provoke the laughter. Instead, you will be guided by a Laughter Yoga professional into following some fun &amp; simple laughter exercises which include clapping, chanting, singing, dancing and of course, LAUGHING. We will have you giggling in no time. Everyone will feel uplifted and energized after the session.<\/p> <p>Laughter reduces feelings of stress, anxiety and depression. Laughter opens up the blood vessels, increases your oxygen levels to the body and brain and boosts the immune system. Did you know that:<\/p> <p>- the Navy uses LY to reduce post traumatic stress syndrome?<\/p> <p>- Cancer patients at the Mayo clinic use LY to build up their immunities and to increase T-cells?<\/p> <p>- Research at U of MD Medical Center has shown that LY increases the net oxygen to the body, which expands the arteries to help blood flow, helping to regulate blood pressure?<\/p> <p>-The American Heart&amp;Stroke Association uses Laughter Yoga to promote a healthy heart and reduce risks of stroke and heart attack.<\/p> <p>- Laughter brings us the the present moment and helps to reduce chronic pain<\/p> <p>-LY helps us face life's challenges and helps us build positive behaviors and resilience.<\/p> <p>Get strong, get laughing!<\/p> <p>Laughter Yoga is non-religious and non-political. Laughter Club meetings are open to all- ages 12 and up.<\/p> <p>If you are able to do light aerobic activity, you can easily participate in Laughter Yoga. If you are unable to perform standing exercises, you can do them seated and we will come to you.<\/p> <p>Curious to know more about Laughter Yoga and what happens at a laughter session?

All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more.

If you have any back issues, please bring a pillow or cushion to place behind you.<\/p> <p>3. The chairs are hard, so you may wish to bring a cushion with you to sit on.<\/p> <p>4. Please remember to turn off your cell phones before entering the room.<\/p> <p>5. Please try not to wear any perfume to the sit, as it can be quite distracting to others.

I am also a certified B.E.S.T. practitioner. Come learn about the law of attraction (loa) and energetic healing\/balancing or come share what has worked for you with the LOA and\/or energetic healing.<\/p> <p><i>\"Your thoughts have the power to change your health and life. When you see someone\u2019s circumstances, you see inside their mind. Therefore, to change your health or life, you must adjust your subconscious\u201d\u00a0 -<\/i>Linda Lawler<\/p> <p>Bio energetic synchronization technique (B.E.S.T.) which is an energetic balancing that removes interference from the subconscious. \u00a0B.E.S.T is a physical yet non-forceful, energy balancing procedure used by the hands to reestablish the full healing potential of the body using its natural healing abilities. This technique and technology was developed over 30 years ago by Dr. M.T. Morter Jr., with the mission to \u201cimprove the health of mankind worldwide\u201d. He has adjusted the royal families, presidents to Dr. Wayne Dyer, Jack Canfield, Dr. Michael Beckwith any countless more with energetic healing. His life will be remembered as one that changed the way to a healthy mind and body. I feel privileged to have trained directly from him.<\/p> <p>The best definition of B.E.S.T is that it removes the interference and distractions that are demanding the attention of the healing power; thereby causing the imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, and ultimately leading to disease. This healing method is also beneficial and effective on animals.<\/p> <p>Researched at major universities, taught in association with many chiropractic colleges and in professional continuing education seminars, B.E.S.T is recognized by the health care industry as an effective healing science. B.E.S.T. is widely used by health care practitioners all over the world who practice mind\/body healing, and who recognize the body is more than the sum of its parts.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Signs you may need a B.E.S.T. treatment are:<\/b><\/p> <p>-Have a disease\/illness<\/p> <p>-Suffer from chronic or occasional pain<\/p> <p>-Tired\/fatigued all of the time<\/p> <p>-Difficulty losing weight<\/p> <p>-Loss of range in motion of your body<\/p> <p>-Feelings of depression, anxiety, bi-polar<\/p> <p>-Feeling your life is in a rut<\/p> <p><b>B.E.S.T. is an effective method to:<\/b><\/p> <p>-optimal health and energy peace of mind and happiness\u00a0<\/p> <p>- expand your energy field\u00a0<\/p> <p>- change the frequency you emit\u00a0<\/p> <p>- transmit the right vibrations\u00a0<\/p> <p>- sync subconscious with goals\/desires\u00a0<\/p> <p>- become a magnet of your desired health and life\u00a0<\/p> <p>-activate the Law of Attraction\u00a0<\/p> <p>- end self-sabotaging tendencies\u00a0<\/p> <p>- natural balancing of nervous system\u00a0<\/p> <p>- remove blocked negative energy<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Meetup agenda:<\/b><\/p> <p>- Introduction to the Law of Attraction (LOA) or help you determine what is blocking the LOA from working for you\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Help you set goals\/dreams with an action plan\u00a0<\/p> <p>- Measure your energy field<\/p> <p>- Help sync your goal to your subconscious mind<\/p> <p>- Energetic healing with B.E.S.T<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Case Study<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0 A woman was experiencing severe pain in her knee. It would swell up for a few days, then go back down, and then swell up for a week. After a few weeks of excruciating pain, the woman went to a doctor. The doctor injected cortisone into her knee and it made the pain go away.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 A few months later the cortisone wore off and her knee hurt even more than it originally did. The doctor injected more cortisone and it was good for another few months. When her knee swelled up again it tore the meniscus of the knee and she was told she would need surgery. After surgery her knee was locked and was very painful. The doctor reported the surgery wasn\u2019t a success and that she would need a knee replacement.<\/p> <p>She wanted to get a second opinion and got a B.E.S.T. treatment. She was told that her knee swelling was a direct response to a past negative experience. The feeling associated with the experience was identified, contact points were made and the interference was removed. Upon standing up from the adjustment table her knee was 95% better. Tears of joy rolled down her face as she walked around the room. Her husband was in disbelief and even more shocked at the speed in which her own body repaired her knee.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Dr. Sue Morter explains it as; the body reveals short-circuited neurological patterns as a result of unresolved subconscious emotional issues, affecting all systems required for health and wholeness.\u00a0 Those patterns can be demonstrated as tight muscles, dysfunctional organs or glands, emotional stress or depression type reactions.\u00a0 By accessing areas of the brain through a pressure point type therapy, that is, touching certain points around the head and body in a specific sequence, while having you think about certain memory stresses, the body begins to reconnect the circuitry with the brain. Clinical experience has shown that by stimulating these specific pressure points as part of the B.E.S.T. procedure, your body can not only begin to feel better, but will actually begin to repair and rebuild.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 For example, if you experience a physical or emotional trauma your body goes into flight or fight mode. Once this circumstance is over with, your subconscious mind needs to update the current status. If something isn't done to update the current status of the threat and remove the interference created, your body's response is stuck and keeps responding over and over to old information causing that particular system to become exhausted. Exhaustion of a system is what leads to pain, ailments and disease. By touching certain key pressure points in the proper sequence with proper energy and identifying the associated feeling, interference is removed from the subconscious. This results in body balancing, healing of ailments and disease as well as syncing your subconscious mind with your goals. Your body will be ready to run at its optimal potential.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Let\u2019s discuss someone with muscle tightness. That muscle tightness was appropriate for a previous situation but is no longer needed at the present time. If a muscle is tight for too long it will cause exhaustion of systems and organs and that will change the way they function. This is observed when someone faces a physical or emotional trauma which causes the mind\/body to go into fight or flight mode. If your neurological patterns aren\u2019t updated after the stress and you continue to be in fight or flight mode your health will deteriorate.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 B.E.S.T. is updating how your past experience is stored in the subconscious mind. This adjustment is not telling the person to forget the memory, but instead neutralizing the interference associated with the negative experience.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 The path toward permanent relief must include finding the root of the pain or distress. Often, the actual cause is not obvious, because pain can be located in one part of the body while the cause may be located in another. This is why the western medicine practice of taking a pill to stop symptoms is doing more harm than good. Symptoms from a headache, high blood pressure, inability to lose weight and rashes are just a few of the ways your body is trying to tell you something isn\u2019t right.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Cause of distress occurs from three areas: trauma, toxicity, and thoughts. This means stress from injury, dietary insufficiencies, or emotional reactions that cause interference in your body. In all cases, the actual cause of pain or distress must be identified and corrected so symptoms do not return.\u00a0 With a B.E.S.T. treatment you will be able to identify the feeling behind the distress and neutralize it.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 There is active and passive healing. The western world of medicine is run as passive healing. Take this pill to make the symptoms go away, is a total disregard to the cause of the symptoms and what your body is trying to tell you. B.E.S.T. is an active healing process. You must do something in order to get better.<\/p> <p>\u00a0 Through daily changes in the choices you make, you can dramatically change your health and life. Other components to active healing are forgiveness, abdominal breathing, and the Morter March. Forgiveness is very important. In order to move forward in life you need to let go of all negative emotions in your past and present. Understand that all stress is an unlearned lesson, while disappointment is just things that are not in our control that don\u2019t go as expected. Abdominal breathing helps change the pattern from survival mode to health mode. The Morter March is an exercise that helps improve neurological balance and can be discussed further during your B.E.S.T session.<\/p> <p>You need to take 100% responsibility of your life. Everything that happens to you is a product of your thoughts. You attracted the positive and negative people and situations in your life. You have the power to change your life.<\/p> <p>\u00a0To learn more about balancing your mind\/body, unlocking the law of attraction and understanding the power of your thoughts, check out my website at\u00a0&lt;a&gt;www.subconsciousadjustment.com.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meeting room on lower level of the Korean restaurant across from la fontaine bleu and the court house.

We encourage you to bring your drums or other percussion instruments. If you don't have any, we have plenty to share. A drum circle is a fun experience that is accessible to anyone who wants to participate regardless of age or experience level. The goal is to achieve oneness with a group, not rhythmic perfection. This is not a professional group, we do this for fun and relaxation. Children are welcome and I have purchased some instruments specifically for kids. Shamanism is the oldest spiritual belief system on earth. Drumming has been a method of group healing and achieving unity since the beginning of time.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun! More information can be found at&lt;a&gt;www.baltimoredragonboatclub.com.&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0Hope to see you there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Head towards the water taxi stop near the UA campus.

Main Street will be completely closed to vehicular traffic between Route 1 South and 7th Street allowing thousands of people to stroll up and down Main Street enjoying numerous food vendors, bands and arts and crafts. The Festival will start with the parade which will begin at 9:00 a.m. Each year this event draws thousands of people who enjoy the day\u2019s festivities and visiting Main Street businesses. \u200b If you have any questions about the Main Street Festival, please call the Laurel Board of Trade at[masked]-0838.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/laurelboardoftrade.wix.com\/lbot342#!main-street-festival\/c17h0\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/laurelboardoftrade.wix.com\/lbot342#!main-street-festival\/c17h0<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Court-Me-Dont-Date-Me\/events\/230899777\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":25200000,"name":"Main Street Festival (Free)","id":"230899777","time":1462626000000,"updated":1462652576000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427767034000,"name":"Court Me Don't Date Me","group_lon":-77.0299987793,"id":18527085,"urlname":"Court-Me-Dont-Date-Me","group_lat":38.9700012207,"who":"Courters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":2,"distance":20.9286556244,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459807971000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This first hike will be 10 miles long starting at the trailhead in Georgetown, DC.

Kinetic Sculptures are creative human-powered works of art custom-built for the race.<br\/>Although they're lots of fun to watch, the Kinetic Sculptures must be able to traverse 14 miles of city roads and be amphibious. The eight-hour race includes a dip into Baltimore harbor and a trip through mud and sand pits at Patterson Park. The organizers expect about 40 entries from teams that have invested a lot of imagination, time, and money building these inventive contraptions that must bear the brunt of the race all afternoon.<\/p> <p>It's all in fun to create a colorful spectacle of artistic design, clever engineering, and human bravado by the many contestants who eagerly propel their machines along Baltimore's streets and waters. The crowd becomes part of the event with their own outrageous costumes and cheering. There are awards presented at the end for everything from best artistic design to worst entry into the water at the Canton ramp.\"<\/p> <p>About The Race:<br\/>From the American Visionary Art Museum\u2014a race of wacky, imaginative, TOTALLY HUMAN-POWERED WORKS OF ART, DESIGNED TO TRAVEL ON LAND, THROUGH MUD, AND OVER DEEP HARBOR WATERS, constructed out of used bicycles, gears, and parts, created by a lunatic genius who tinkers around in the garage or backyard (do you know this person?)! The machines can be simple, small crafts, piloted by only one brave soul, or they can be over 50 feet long, extremely well-engineered, sophisticated vehicles powered by a team of pilots. Pilots (\"Kinetinauts\") compete for the most coveted GRAND MEDIOCRE EAST COAST CHAMPION AWARD (finishes right in the middle), and the highly prized NEXT TO THE LAST AWARD (finishes, well, next-to-last), and other serious trophies including ART, ENGINEERING, BEST BRIBES and more. The all-day race kicks off at 11am at American Visionary Art Museum.

find\u00a0our friends from the Watersedge Meetup Group on Dibbins Island when we stop there for lunch. \u00a0Kayakers will take over the Island!<\/p> <p>This paddle is\u00a0tentatively being scheduled WITHOUT a cold water gear requirement. \u00a0We'll see what actual water temps in the area are as the weekend gets a little closer. \u00a0I may have to require cold water gear for this paddle if the water temps don't get better.<\/p> <p>The actual attendance limit for this paddle is 30 paddlers.\u00a0\u00a06 spots have been set aside for people who will be renting kayaks.\u00a0 If you are a renter on the waiting list I will\u00a0move you to the attending list.\u00a0\u00a0 Those spots not filled by renters 24 hours before the paddle will be filled with members on the waiting list\u00a0who have paid the voluntary dues.\u00a0 Everyone has the same chance to sign up for the first 24 slots.<\/p> <p>No this\u00a0is NOT\u00a0a race.\u00a0 I used the term marathon because it is a long paddle at 12 to 14 miles.\u00a0 People always ask me what my favorite paddle is. \u00a0I can't seem to pick a single one but the Magothy is one of the top 3 contenders.<\/p> <p>The Magothy River is used to be of the hardest Chesapeake Bay tidal\u00a0tributaries to find easy public access to. \u00a0That has changed thanks to the efforts of the Arundel Public Water Access Committee. \u00a0It is in my opinion one of the neatest tributaries to paddle.\u00a0 The scenery varies from middle class\u00a0residential neighborhoods at the put in\u00a0where the river is only 20 yards wide to Gibson's Island at the mouth where it enters the Bay.\u00a0 In between you'll find everything from multi-million dollar homes to Dobbin's Island where if we're lucky the sno-ball boat will be hanging out at a beach where the locals gather to swim.\u00a0 Bring a few dollars for a sno-ball\/sno-cone.<\/p> <p>Please note that 10:30 AM is the \"on the water time\".\u00a0 Please arrive with plenty of time to have your boat and gear ready to launch\u00a0 by then.\u00a0 See my comments about getting to the water below.\u00a0 It will take longer at this put in so come even earlier than usual.<\/p> <p>Pack a lunch and bring your wheels.\u00a0 Access to this put in can be best described as difficult.\u00a0 If you don't have wheels, we will help you carry to the water.\u00a0 At least we don't have to drop the boats down the foundation of an old building like we use to, we just have a longer trail to get the boats to the new put in.\u00a0 This is an adventure that takes some effort to get to the water but everyone who has ever done it with me says it's well worth it but you will drive away from the put in at least a little bit exhausted.<\/p> <p>This is an all day adventure.\u00a0 Expect to paddle a minimum of\u00a012 to\u00a014 miles and get back to the take out around 4:30.\u00a0 Don't worry though, we will take plenty of breaks along the way.<\/p> <p>Rental kayaks including a paddle and PFD are available for this paddle at the weekend rate of $55.00.\u00a0 To reserve a rental boat for this paddle simply answer the rental question when you RSVP. \u00a0Member who pay the voluntary annual dues get a $5.00 discount on all rentals<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Chesapeake-Kayak-Adventures\/events\/230818795\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Magothy River

Instead of being stuck watching the race from one spot, our group will move along with the racing teams on our bikes to see them in action the whole way. We've had a blast doing this event for several years!<\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be riding the same route used by the racing teams on road lanes separated from car traffic, so this is a rare chance to see Baltimore's best sights without getting run over.\u00a0Our route takes us through Federal Hill, Inner Harbor, Little Italy, Fells Point, Canton, and Patterson Park, as well as many famous streets along the way. You can view all the details, photos, and the entire race route below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.kineticbaltimore.com<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/c\/f\/600_436637359.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Following our ride, we'll head to Barfly's on Federal Hill to enjoy their excellent pizza and beer. Barfly's is located just two blocks from where we park our cars at the beginning, so it's a convenient place to end up and socialize.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Baltimore's Kinetic Sculpture Race<\/b><\/p> <p>Each May, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.avam.org\/\">American Visionary Art Museum<\/a> (AVAM) hosts the East Coast Kinetic Sculpture Race Championship around Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor. Kinetic Sculptures are creative human-powered works of art custom-built for the race.<\/p> <p><br\/>Although they're lots of fun to watch, the Kinetic Sculptures must be able to traverse 14 miles of city roads and be amphibious. The eight-hour race includes a dip into Baltimore harbor and a trip through mud and sand pits at Patterson Park. The organizers expect about 40 entries from teams that have invested a lot of imagination, time, and money building these inventive contraptions that must bear the brunt of the race all afternoon.<\/p> <p>It's all in fun to create a colorful spectacle of artistic design, clever engineering, and human bravado by the many contestants who eagerly propel their machines along Baltimore's streets and waters. The crowd becomes part of the event with their own outrageous costumes and cheering. There are awards presented at the end for everything from best artistic design to worst entry into the water at the Canton ramp.<\/p> <p>Here are some of the entries from previous races:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/e\/6\/7\/600_446424167.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/f\/c\/600_436637404.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/1\/b\/600_436637435.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Meetup and Biking Plan<\/b><\/p> <p>Our group will meet at the parking lot by McDonald's\u00a0in the Southside Market shopping plaza on E. Fort Avenue. You can get there directly from I-95 by taking Exit 55 to Key Highway or by driving through Federal Hill from Inner Harbor.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The shopping plaza has ample free parking for its many stores and is located right on the route of the Kinetic Sculpture Race. We'll get a great view of the racing entries from there without encountering any big crowds. DO NOT PARK IN THE MARKED McDONALDS CUSTOMER AREA. McDonalds tows violators, and it happened to one of our members.<\/p> <p>After watching the Kinetic Sculptures pass by while the racing teams are fresh and vigorous, we'll ride our bikes over to the Cross Street Market to enjoy some tasty food and refreshments. Bruce Lee's wings and burgers and Nick's sushi bar and beer are favorites. It's fun to stand in the market aisles while eating and drinking on the barrel tables. There are also several other eating options available in the Cross Street Market.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/4\/3\/7\/600_436637463.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/8\/600_436637240.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Following lunch and refreshments, we'll bike along the race route through Inner Harbor and Fells Point to catch up with the racing teams where they launch into the harbor at Canton Waterfront Park. Then our group will follow them up to Patterson Park for the mud pit and sand trap part of the race.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There's plenty of time to watch everything, relax, and enjoy the historic Canton area. After Patterson Park, we'll follow the racers back through Inner Harbor and along Key Highway up to Federal Hill where the the race ends.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Helmets Are Required For All Riders<\/b><\/p> <p>This is an easy bike ride that's suitable for anyone who can breathe and pedal at the same time. But you must be able to keep up with our group during the afternoon if you want to stay with us. Otherwise, you're on your own which is okay since Baltimore is a fun place to explore.<\/p> <p><b>Post-Ride Pizza at Barfly's<\/b><\/p> <p>After completing the ride and loading bikes on our cars, we'll walk two blocks to Barfly's for refreshments and excellent pizza.

But as always keep the end user's (you or the client's) opinion the highest weight in that balance.<\/p> <p>In this workshop our goal is to provoke emotions and thought with \"Subject, Composition, Light, and Exposure\" for that wonderful shot. With all good results planning is needed to increase our shot success ratio. Many items make up a good image and it all starts with good communication, spiritually within the artist (don't shoot until you see it) and verbally with your subject. We will have two returning models, Mina, Rebecca, and other DMV models as needed. There will be one model per two shooters. (And if more women sign up we will include male models.)<\/p> <p>We will create the scene, but the focus will be on \"parts\" of the model in the scene. (Again composition is key!) In some \"parts\" assignments photographers work with known viewers fetishes to bring out and provoke emotion for the art viewer; legs, shoes, hands, garters, handcuffs, rope, and so on. Some of these scenes will be done in our studio and outside to help give the final image the look and feel you were looking for. Then we will move into full scene storytelling views.<\/p> <p>So, here is another workshop opportunity to broaden your shooting selections while you work on becoming one with your creative balance. Controlling the \"artistry and mechanical\" sides of our brains as we use the camera to capture what we feel and see in our mind's eye.<\/p> <p>Join us and the beautiful Valora as she is only in town for very short time, and our very own Charlie.<\/p> <p><i>Ps.

This book is a great entry point for westerners who are looking to understand the Buddhist path. It is pithy, \u00a0and adapted to our cultural understanding. Here is a brief description from Rinpoche about the contents of this book:<\/p> <p>\"There\u2019s a rebel within you. It\u2019s the part of you that already knows how to break free of fear and unhappiness. This rebel is the voice of your own awakened mind.

It wakes you up from the sleepy acceptance of your day-to-day reality and shows you the power of your enlightened nature. It\u2019s the vibrant, insightful energy that compels you to seek the truth.\"<\/p> <p>We'll be playing the book from its audio version.

You will learn the results of what happens when milk (or cream) is substituted for water or when additives are added to the water. Experiment with colored water! See the difference in the splash in a shallow pan versus a deeper pan. Increase the size of the water drops and watch what happens.<\/p> <p>Make sure you have a few large memory cards and extra batteries for your camera. Feel free to bring your own flash unit(s) to try.

After the meditation we will read a few pages from he Yoga Vasistha which is a must read for anyone who is sincerely curious to know more about our existence, the real, the unreal, the truth and the illusions in life. This meditation will occur every Monday evening unless notified otherwise. Hope you take this wonderful opportunity of cleansing yourself every Monday with these amazing vibrations!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/I-meditate-Baltimore-meditators\/events\/229599005\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":4500000,"name":"Rudram Meditation followed by Yoga Vasistha reading","id":"lrscmlyvhbmb","time":1462834800000,"updated":1462841422000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1386817452000,"name":"I Meditate Baltimore Group Meditators","group_lon":-76.5400009155,"id":11428542,"urlname":"I-meditate-Baltimore-meditators","group_lat":39.2799987793,"who":"Effortless Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21206","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"6908 Belair Rd.","name":"Maryland Naturalist Center","lon":-76.527779,"id":1451803,"state":"MD","lat":39.357463,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":6.79785251617,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1462020659000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/6\/a\/600_427243882.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Learn to identify plants in an informal setting with other inquisitive people and a botanist who can answer your questions.\u00a0 Bring a plant or twig from your own backyard.\u00a0 Or look at one from an ongoing inventory of the Baltimore County Ag Center.<\/p> <p>All experience levels are welcome.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have botany books, hand lenses, dried plant specimens, and a microscope available for you to use.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b><\/p> <p>Members of the <b>Natural History Society of Maryland<\/b> - $15 for both sessions this month, paid at the first session.\u00a0 Individual sessions for non-members and members - $10.\u00a0 Pay cash or check at the door.<\/p> <p><br\/>Become a member at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marylandnature.org\/\">www.marylandnature.org<\/a> (individual $25; family $35).<\/p> <p>The sessions will be facilitated by <b>Charlie Davis<\/b> and <b>Judy Fulton<\/b>.\u00a0 Charlie is a professional field ecologist who specializes in plants.\u00a0 Judy is a Master Gardener who is conducting a plant inventory at the Baltimore County Center for MD Agricultural and Farm Park.<\/p> <p>Both Charlie and Judy are volunteers, so your money for these sessions will go directly to support the programs, the nature collections, and the building that make this kind of nature education possible.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Come through the double glass doors at the top of the stairs and ramp.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/marylandnature\/events\/230765134\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"What's this plant?","id":"230765134","time":1462834800000,"updated":1462842955000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1290469464000,"name":"The Natural History Society of Maryland","group_lon":-76.5299987793,"id":1741675,"urlname":"marylandnature","group_lat":39.3400001526,"who":"Naturalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459800056000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/8\/b\/e\/600_448578622.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>After <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sosdaters.com\/#!testimonials\/c1ak5\">coaching countless women to marriage, engagement and relationships<\/a>.

Losing your sense of security, dignity or identity during a traumatic event has a way of changing you unconsciously. The brain isolates itself from reality to uphold deeply held beliefs in order to keep you functioning in the way it has become accustom. The brain will actively resist any disruption in the foundation of relationships, routine or identity. The problem with unacknowledged pain, jealousy and anger is that it does not go away when you are in denial; the feeling will only grow and the denial will become stronger to counteract. With these underlying feelings the lens with which you view the world is tinted unconsciously. This leaves you in a powerless state in which growth becomes painfully difficult. This sounds dire, but is actually a great opportunity for personal growth. By making friends with the events in your life and continually acknowledging your feelings, you will be prepared to take the journey required to care for yourself and your family.

Each dimension is a different vibrational state that perpetuates certain perceptions and attitudes.<br\/>In fourth dimensional awareness people\u00a0begin to have spiritual experiences that include insights and information from other beings. Intuition develops more fully, stimulating expansions of the five senses to perceive what is not readily apparent on the physical plane, increasing empathy, precognition, dreams and healing abilities. Connections are made with angelic beings, elementals and alien races.<\/p> <p>Becoming comfortable with your gifts and developing relationships with other-dimensional beings can enhance your healing practice and expand your own skills.<\/p> <p>Fourth-Dimensional Healing\u00a0looks beyond the confines of the physical body to understand the human being as a vast, multi-dimensional energy being.\u00a0Using the model of chronic illness, and western medicine\u2019s inability to find cures, Spiritual Counselor and Author Randi Botnick explains how illness stems from a false belief in separation from Source, and how that results in physical dis-ease.\u00a0 Randi will also conduct a group energy healing session to begin your healing process.<br\/>In this talk, Randi will:<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0Explain what her vision of multidimensional healing is and why it is the best technique to heal the root causes of all physical, mental, emotional and spiritual issues;<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0Share her process of intuitive healing; and<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0Offer\u00a0 simple techniques to facilitate your own healing by connecting to your personal Spiritual Healing Team. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Bio:<br\/><\/b>Randi\u2019s healing career began in 1997 after receiving her certifications as both a Sekhem-Seichim-Reiki Master Teacher and an Integrative Yoga Therapy yoga instructor. She continued her training in Clinical Hypnotherapy as well as The Results System\u00ae, two techniques that create profound shifts in habituated thoughts and feelings by accessing beliefs held in the subconscious mind.<br\/>In the spring of 2010, while meditating, Randi spontaneously began channeling the Ashtar Command, a group of Lightbeings and angels who are assisting us as the Earth and all of her inhabitants move into the fourth dimension.<br\/>In 2014, the Federation of Councils introduced themselves to Randi as a benevolent group of Lightbeings here to support us at this time. They are at the core of her spiritual healing team, offering her clients information and relief in all aspects of their lives.<br\/>Randi is the author of 4th-Dimensional Healing: A Guidebook for a New Paradigm of Healing. She lives and works in Baltimore County where she has created a unique healing practice that combines all of her gifts and training.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS\/events\/230571140\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"4th Dimensional Healing: Randi Botnick","id":"230571140","time":1462921200000,"updated":1462939087000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421254044000,"name":"Baltimore Friends of IONS","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18334650,"urlname":"Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Psychonauts, Explorers, Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"5625 O'Donnell St","name":"Best Western Plus Hotel & Conference Center","lon":-76.546928,"id":23931811,"lat":39.280125,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.97523832321,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452536229000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>REAL WORLD LOCAL CONTENT TO HELP YOU GROW AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTOR IN VA, DC, &amp; MD!<\/p> <p>Over 1500 DC Metro Real Estate Investors and growing!

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

With all the talk about Agile development methods like SCRUM and Extreme Programming, the question arises as to how these approaches can be used to deliver data warehouse and business intelligence projects faster. This presentation will look at the 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto and see how they can be applied in the context of a data warehouse project. The goal is to determine a method or methods to get a more rapid (2-4 weeks) delivery of portions of an enterprise data warehouse architecture. Real world examples with metrics will be discussed.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kentgraziano\">Kent Graziano<\/a> is a Senior Technical Evangelist with Snowflake Computing and the author of The Data Warrior blog (<a href=\"http:\/\/kentgraziano.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kentgraziano.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/kentgraziano.com<\/a><\/a>).\u00a0 He is a certified Data Vault Master (CDVP2), Oracle ACE Director, expert data modeler and architect with over 30 years of experience, including 25 years doing data warehousing with multiple architectures.

To reserve a site, click here:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reserveamerica.com\/facilityDetails.do?contractCode=MD&amp;parkId=380507\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.reserveamerica.com\/facilityDetails.do?contractCode=MD&amp;parkId=380507<\/a><\/p> <p>There will not be a ton of structure to this Meetup. We will meet for Friday and Saturday sunsets and depending on how late the campfire goes, Saturday and Sunday sunrise. Mostly this will be about hanging out, capturing images, and sharing the experience. More information about times to meet and shoot will be forthcoming as we get closer to the event.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The park requires you to reserve for 2 night minimums and spaces are limited, so if you are interested, you will need to act fast. Any of the sections will give you access to all the areas and are walkable. You will need camping gear (tent, long tent stakes for the sand, sleeping bag or bedding, air mattress or mat, towels, cooking gear or stuff for cold sandwiches, etc). You can buy firewood at a shop near by the camp ground. You cannot bring firewood with you. Make sure you see the rules for camping on the Reserve America website.

We want to clear up a few things! Misunderstanding about protein and carbs have undermined the progress of countless confused Americans.<\/p> <p>Our team includes a medical doctor, a registered dietitian, and a couple of experienced health coaches who are ready to set the record straight!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Once again, your loyal organizers have scoured You Tube for the best short videos on these critical but misunderstood topics. We discovered that Garth Davis M.D. is one of the best communicators about protein we\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s the author of the acclaimed new book \u2018Protein-aholic,\u2019 and a bariatric surgeon trying to put himself out of business. He is incredulous that the medical community, bariatric specialists included, seem to be ignorant of the basic published nutrition science.<\/p> <p>And we\u2019ve picked out the best short videos on the ridiculously popular topic of carbohydrates. Some swear they do better after going gluten-free (i.e. low carb). Yet some of the best published outcomes have been with diets that get 60 \u2013 80% of calories from carbohydrates.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Then there\u2019s the potato controversy. People think they're \u201cfattening.\u201d But some respected authorities say that we\u2019ve been avoiding these low-calorie comfort foods for too long! One of Chef AJ\u2019s Secrets of Ultimate Weight Loss is: \u201cEat Potatoes.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>How to explain the discrepancy? Hint: 90% of the carbohydrates Americans consume are . . . . PROCESSED. Bread flour is different than wheat berries, and corn flakes may not be quite the same as whole corn.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Your four organizers, Joe, Vlad, Emily and Jamila, will be on hand to help and advise you during and after this meeting. Vlad and Jamila are experienced and inspiring coaches. Joe is an M.D. and Emily is an R.D. (Registered Dietitian). We're not looking for paying clients. In fact, Joe and Emily don't accept paying clients. We just want to help, as volunteers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please bring a dish that is vegan (no dairy, egg, fish or meat of any kind), and not too much, if any, SOS (salt, oil, sugar). It's not mandatory to bring food, but please try to bring something to share that fits these criteria, so that we don't run short. You can get some ideas at &lt;a&gt;www.NutritionAsMedicine.org.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>If no time to cook, you can just bring some fruit, etc. If you're not in a position to bring food for any reason, that's OK, just bring yourself (and friends).\u00a0<\/p> <p>And if you're new to all of this, you're especially welcome.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you are bringing a dish, PLEASE bring a piece of paper with your name, the name of the dish AND INGREDIENTS (or recipe, even better, but at least ingredients - for those who are food-sensitive or following certain diets). Your name, and name of the dish, is so people can ask you for the recipe.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We raffle off great kitchen items each time. The raffle is open to anyone who is attending their first, second or third Meetup here, OR anyone who has brought food with a list of ingredients, or the recipe.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If anyone has questions or wants to chat, please call Joe Adams M.D. at[masked] if you're not sure this is right for you, or if you're looking for a little help on how to break out of whatever barriers you might be facing.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please join the free, twice-monthly conference calls for extra support and information, with some of the organizers and other participants. They\u2019re always on the Third Thursday and First Tuesday of each month, at 7:30 pm. \u00a0The dial-in number is always:[masked], and the access code is always[masked]#.

While this is on the late side, I figure it's as early as we can do without hitting back traffic if anyone is driving from NOVA. Unless I hear otherwise, I'll drop down there to pick up the DC carless crowd. Use the comments section if you want other carpool options.\u00a0 If this is causing you to drive completely around the beltway, use the comments sections to arrange a better carpool location for you.<\/p> <p><br\/>Drive to the trailhead:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Greenbelt+Metro+Parking+Lot,+Greenbelt+Metro+Drive,+Greenbelt,+MD\/41.5260118,-76.8317914\/@40.2748897,-78.0054159,8z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c3ed7c050a69:0x30d998ecba736505!2m2!1d-76.9063764!2d39.0125285!1m0!3e0?hl=en\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Greenbelt+Metro+Parking+Lot,+Greenbelt+Metro+Drive,+Greenbelt,+MD\/41.5260118,-76.8317914\/@40.2748897,-78.0054159,8z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c3ed7c050a69:0x30d998ecba736505!2m2!1d-76.9063764!2d39.0125285!1m0!3e0?hl=en<\/a><br\/>This has us heading up 95. If we have folks coming from downtown Baltimore, we could probably stop by the park and ride where I-70 ends right after 695 for car pooling. (Use the comments area if this applies to you)<\/p> <p>We'll shoot for the same approach to the OLP as the last running. Specifically, parking near where the trail intersects Ellenton Ridge Rd. If Ellenton Ridge Rd turns out to be impassable with the cars that we have, the PA Bureau of Forestry map shows a trailhead off of the paved road NW of Ellenton onto the Hawkeye Cross Country Ski Trail, which connects to the OLP via the Sharp Shinned Trail.<\/p> <p>We'll head clockwise around the OLP. Since it will be almost midnight when we hit the trailhead, we'll take the first reasonable dispersed camping that we come upon. Sunrise: 5:50am<br\/>Sunset: 8:20pm<\/p> <p>Saturday: we'll shoot for between 20-23 mi. PA state forests have campfire bans until May 25th, so we'll probably catch up on the sleep that we missed on Friday night on Saturday night. The Mid-Atlantic map notes some nice campsites near Yellow Dog Road. We'll regroup at least twice on Saturday: at Masten and at the Pleasant Stream ford. Gantz's guide notes that the crossing at Pleasant Stream can be dangerious in high water, so we'll do some re-routing if it doesn't look safe to cross.<\/p> <p>Sunday: remaining 6-8 miles. Likely stop at bullfrogbrewery on the way back for lunch.

This is the time to visit Cuba our mysterious (to Americans) yet closest neighbors to our south. Until now, Cuba was the only country in the world off-limits to U.S. visitors\u2026 so time to go \u2013 now!<\/p> <p><br\/>This is the trip for you if you\u2019re interested in Cuba\u2019s culture and its people rather than beach resorts. Our one-week itinerary is optimized to sample some of the most interesting areas of Cuba.<\/p> <p>The tour takes your from the bustling and vibrant Havana, to its neighbors to the east and west including the historic Santa Clara, and gives you the chance to experience the more traditional and rural sides of Cuba, with stays in Trinidad, Cienfuegos and Vi\u00f1ales.<\/p> <p>These places are the top favorites for travelers who have come to Cuba seeking authentic cultural experiences. While Trinidad presents us with beautiful white sand beaches, colonial architecture, waterfalls, and a charming village atmosphere, Vi\u00f1ales offers stunning mountainous scenery, sprawling tobacco fields and friendly locals.<\/p> <p>This is a small group trip with no more than 12 people to allow us to travel around in a more independent, intimate way.<\/p> <p>Why is Cuba so special?<\/p> <p>For many travelers, Cuba ends up being an unforgettable and unique experience.<\/p> <p>Cuba, with its mix of Spanish and African roots, is the largest, least commercialized, and most exciting island in the Caribbean. It is also one of the world\u2019s last bastions of communism with a fascinating modern history.<\/p> <p>Cuba\u2019s relative political isolation has prevented it from being overrun by tourists, and locals are sincerely friendly to those who do venture in.<\/p> <p>Perhaps this isolation from the more modern world has helped conserve the personality of the Cuban society. Cuba definitely feels like the pulsating heart of what it means to be Latino, with music, dance, and the fiesta being core to this.<\/p> <p>Much of Latin America\u2019s music and dance seems to originate in Cuba and likewise could be said about the Latino persona. Once visiting Cuba, many start to see the rest of Latin America as, culturally, a watered down version of Cuba.<\/p> <p>Cubans can be described as gregarious, loud, expressive, open, warm, generous, and extremely friendly people \u2013 kind of like an Italian, or a Spaniard, but with added spices. To be immersed in this culture can be an exhilarating and uplifting experience.<\/p> <p>Cuba seems to be lost in time, somewhere in the 1950\u2019s. It\u2019s not just the old American cars in the streets or the exquisite colonial architecture with peeling paint in Old Havana.<\/p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s a sense that the world of modern tourism has somehow largely bypassed the Caribbean\u2019s largest island. This mixture makes Cuba an undeniably enticing destination.<\/p> <p>Why go now?<\/p> <p>Located only 80 miles south of Key West FL, Americans have not been allowed to visit from the U.S. for more than five decades. Because of its new accessibility, Cuba is understandably a hot destination where Americans will be pouring into soon.<\/p> <p>The \u201creal\u201d Cuba as it is right now will be transformed into a touristy destination that will not resemble its current, authentic condition.<\/p> <p>However, at the moment, there is still limited transportation options into Cuba, very little infrastructure to accommodate the tremendous influx of expected visitors, and still a fair amount of confusion &amp; many details to iron out with our newly restored economic ties between the U.S. and Cuba.<\/p> <p>There is a small window of opportunity \u2013 predicted to close as soon as the latter part of next year \u2013 where relatively small numbers of travelers will visit as things continue to be figured out &amp; the tourism industry works to get organized.<\/p> <p>Our small, nimble, quick on their feet group is ready to move-out now while the window is still open to visit the authentic, pre-tourism Cuba. Clearly\u2026 the time to go is now.<\/p> <p>This trip will be led by a fantastic, fully licensed, People-to-People small group tour operator who is authorized to work with American clients and has designed an itinerary to give you the most authentic, educational, and enjoyable introduction to this fascinating and complex country.<\/p> <p><b>Go here to reserve your spot on our Cuba adventure (fill out the booking form &amp; pay a 30% deposit) &amp; get all trip details: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yoloworldtravel.com\/cuba\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yoloworldtravel.com\/cuba\/<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>This trip is limited to 12 travelers maximum.

We are not meeting to just practice the Italian language. Instead, we are holding a meeting to talk about and celebrate BEING Italian.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nI have talked with so many of you since starting this group who have amazing stories about your and your family's experiences as part of the greater Italian American experience. I'd like to meet for an informal chat in which we have the opportunity to share these stories. My hope is that this Meetup will spark ideas for others of a similar nature.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAgain, the goal is for this to be informal and FUN. We're Italian, so no matter how much we may plan in advance, when we get together and start chatting, there's no telling where it will go! To help us attempt to organize, give some thought to the following questions and feel free to share when we meet: '<\/p> <p>\n\n\n1. The thing I love most about being Italian is...(don't be shy!)<br\/>2. My favorite Italian Americanisms\/Italian American slang are... (this is going to be good!)<br\/>3. My proudest Italian\/Italian American moment was...(so looking forward to these!)<br\/>4. If there is one thing I hope the next generation of those with Italian heritage maintains and celebrates, it would be...(can't wait to hear these either!)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is for ALL ages and \"generations\" - 1st, 2nd, 3rd - and \"percentages.\" If you identify as being Italian, know a lot about it or you're curious about learning more about it, come join us.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you can't make it this Saturday, please feel free to share some of your own answers and ideas in the comments section below. You're a member of this group, whether you can attend or not!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you do not have to have Italian heritage to attend. All are welcome.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

People can go as fast or slow as they want since we'll all end up at the same place afterward. Total time to circle the park and see everything should be about three hours or so.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/2\/1\/c\/600_449836924.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/3\/0\/f\/600_439744879.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Afterward at the Annapolis Smokehouse<\/b><\/p> <p>Following the walk, we'll head to the Annapolis Smokehouse for food and refreshments.
