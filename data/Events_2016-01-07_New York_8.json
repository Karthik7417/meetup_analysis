Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/227619270\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvcbfb","time":1451829600000,"updated":1451841995000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450466843000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i>\u00a0(MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

Inwood Hill Park is a living piece of old New York. Evidence of its prehistoric roots exists as dramatic caves, valleys, and ridges left as the result of shifting glaciers. Evidence of its uninhabited state afterward remains as its forest and salt marsh (the last natural one in Manhattan), and evidence of its use by Native Americans in the 17th century continues to be discovered. Much has occurred on the land that now composes Inwood Hill Park since the arrival of European colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries, but luckily, most of the park was largely untouched by the wars and development that took place.<\/p> <p>This is an article that was written in 2002 about the geology of Manhattan.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Quote<\/p> <p>\"With its diamond district and glittering jewelry emporiums like Tiffany's and Harry Winston, Manhattan has always been a top destination for the gem-obsessed.

But what most people, even rock hounds, may not know is that buried below the skyscrapers and sidewalks, the city's bedrock is a trove of minerals, crystals and gem-quality stones.<\/p> <p><br\/>Members of the New York Mineralogical Club have been hunting for such treasures for the last 115 years. During historic tunnel, subway and skyscraper excavations, they've unearthed sparkling mineral crystals, some of them clear-colored and precious, including blue-green aquamarines, chunks of smoky quartz, golden beryl, topaz, black tourmalines and wine-red garnets.\"\u00a0End Quote<\/p> <p>I have more detail, but cannot publicize it due to it being a private location.<\/p> <p>Polished and Cut and Rough Aquamarines<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/1\/4\/600_442555316.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/0\/c\/600_442555308.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Rough and polished Cut Golden Beryl<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/2\/2\/600_442555330.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/8\/2\/e\/600_442555342.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nIts there, in Manhattan, waiting for you to find it.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0You will need a real Rock Hammer, click here to Buy it,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SE-8399-RH-ROCK-11-Inch-Rock-Hammer\/dp\/B003JKIYJM\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443592645&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=geologist+rock+hammer\">Buy the Rock Hammer<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Safety glasses and a small backpack with food \u00a0water and snacks as there are no food stores where we are going.<\/p> <p>We will meet at 11:00 am, we will finish around 2pm. \u00a0This is will be a moderate level hike, rock scramble Adventure. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Warning:<\/p> <p>If you have an injury to your leg, back, neck, or if you cannot lift youself up over a downed tree or large boulders, \u00a0this event may not be for you.<\/p> <p>Text me with any questions, \u00a0i will not put the location online. \u00a0<\/p> <p>George, Organizer, Treasure Hunter, Adventurer[masked]<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDisclaimer:<\/p> <p>By signing up to this non profit, volunteer led meetup group event, you are aware that Adventures, Hiking and Rock Scrambles are dangerous, furthermore, \u00a0you agree to not sue, hold liable, or bring any civil or criminal action against this meetup group, its organizers or anyone in the meetup organization.<\/p> <p><br\/>Click the link below for all of NY State places to go Rockhounding.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=smuFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=%22Rockhounding+New+York:+A+Guide+to+the+State%27s+Best+Rockhounding+Sites%22+by+Robert+Beard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fNo5XPZ0YQ&amp;sig=A7HvGGsXZ-5XlQcmQ_R9eq8OfcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cyRIVbipBITfsAWnyoHAAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rockhounding%20New%20York%3A%20A%20Guide%20to%20the%20State\">NYS Rock Hounding Sites<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"You will get a meeting location after you RSVP","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FitAndFun\/events\/227582438\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"NYC Treasure Hunt, Garnets, Quartz, Beryl and More.","id":"227582438","time":1451836800000,"updated":1451859692000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1161468490000,"name":"Fit and Fun and Active Singles","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":349600,"urlname":"FitAndFun","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Fun Active Singles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Bronx","address_1":"1385 Metropolitan Avenue","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.861389,"id":24264824,"state":"NY","lat":40.835392,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.96643924713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451356522000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be an excellent way to begin 2016!

Lily is a published bikini and lingerie model based out of Boston and has become one of our favorite models to work with over the past year. She gives her all at every shoot and such amazing photos to boot. We are looking forward to this special shoot with Lily Marie as she may be joining a management company soon and we are honored to be one of her last shoots, if not her last shoot as a freelance model. So, If you haven't had the opportunity to work with this beauty, this is a can't miss shoot.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About this Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have planned out three looks with Lily Marie: First look will be a bikini, pinup look. Second look will be a lingerie look with a Victoria Secret style. (We'll be using the LED lights for this one for a more romantic, dramatic style.) The third look will be a Pre-Valentine's inspired implied look with bedsheets. (As per Lily, up to nude implied.)<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>For new members: Please take the time to read the info below about how the Meetup is organized and how the\u00a0shooting parameters are setup so you know what to expect at the shoot.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>NEW:\u00a0Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox as that adds the surcharge automatically.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/227625679\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Bikini, Lingerie & Implied Shoot w\/Lily Marie - Jan. 3rd","id":"227625679","time":1451840400000,"updated":1451869227000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":" 247 Elizabeth Street  (South of Houston and West of bowery)","name":"T shop (Rear store behind the tarot card reader)","lon":-73.994087,"id":24038417,"state":"NY","lat":40.723499,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.84729838371,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449174412000,"fee":{"amount":5,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/3\/4\/8\/600_444718184.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Let's gather and bless this New Year together.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Ahhhhh it's finally here.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

I was hoping to get this scheduled before the new year - however I have a hunch that Dec. will be tight for many - so aiming to ring in the new year with a good book discussion! We are reading Purity by Jonathan Franzen.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Purity-A-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen\/dp\/0374239215\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Purity-A-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen\/dp\/0374239215<\/a><\/p> <p>An Amazon Best Book of September 2015: Purity takes many forms in Franzen\u2019s new novel\u2014to begin with, it is the name of the book\u2019s title character. \u201cPip,\u201d as she is more commonly known, is not fond of her given name, and when we first meet her she is living in a crowded Oakland house under the burden of colossal college debt. Pip soon becomes involved in \u201cThe Sunlight Project,\u201d a WikiLeaks-style group that seeks to uncover secrets and expose them on the web. Run by Andreas Wolf, a charismatic man of renown, who grew up in socialist East Germany, the Sunlight Project becomes the jumping-off point of discovery for Pip, as well as a starting line for Franzen to jump back in time and explore the backgrounds of his primary and secondary characters. There is a point in the book where readers may wonder where this is all headed; but the thoughtfulness and polish of Franzen\u2019s prose should reassure that the journey isn\u2019t in vain. It eventually becomes clear that nearly every character is chasing purity in some form\u2014whether pursuing Pip herself or some platonic ideal\u2014and Franzen ties up the ends in a way that is clean and satisfying but will have you thinking about Purity long after you have finished the book. --Chris Schluep<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Summit-NJ-Book-Club-for-people-who-love-to-read\/events\/227121603\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Discuss our recent read:  Purity by Jonathan Franzen","id":"227121603","time":1451844000000,"updated":1451853054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389879396000,"name":"Summit NJ Book Club: For People Who Love to Read","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":12184042,"urlname":"Summit-NJ-Book-Club-for-people-who-love-to-read","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Book lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10028","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1616 2nd Avenue","address_2":"(corner of East 84th St)","lon":-73.959999,"phone":"212.772.6660","name":"Dorrian's","id":145196,"state":"NY","lat":40.779999,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60537290573,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451585293000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>YOU LIKE THAT!!!

The exceptional wine list includes over 30 varietals from the South of France, Italy, and Spain that are offered by the glass, along with full bottles and champagne.<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's the link to their Brunch menu:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.figandolive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SD_Brunch.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Here are snippets of reviews about this place:\u00a0<\/p> <p>from Westchester magazine:\u00a0The zucchini carpaccio at the new butter-free (olive oil only) Mediterranean restaurant\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/figandolive.com\/\">Fig &amp; Olive Westchester<\/a>\u00a0(696 White Plains Rd, Scarsdale[masked]) is the perfect starter to any meal: thinly sliced zucchini finished with Picholine olive oil, fresh lemon juice, pine nuts, and Parmesan. Equally delicious is the Proven\u00e7e vegetable and burrata platter of burrata, tomato, balsamic, arugula, black olive, zucchini, and bell pepper served with pesto ricotta dip and basil olive oil. And the list goes on: fig Gorgonzola tartlet; penne with cremini mushroom, Parmesan, black truffle paste, and white truffle olive oil; and the mushroom and truffle soup.<\/p> <p>Another said, \"Very surprised how excellent the service and food quality was. I had previously visited and was not impressed but clearly they have improved tremendously ... Will definitely visit again!\"<\/p> <p><br\/>and one more said, \"Just as delicious as their West Hollywood location. \u00a0My parents were in town and we were too tired to head into the city for dinner but wanted a nice experience. \u00a0This location did not disappoint, interesting olive oils offered with the focaccia bread. \u00a0We had the burrata and shrimp crostinis which were great, burrata was incredibly creamy and fresh. \u00a0I had the penne fungi tartufo, you can't really go wrong with white truffle olive oil. \u00a0My husband's veal was perfectly cooked, my dad was pleased with the sirloin and raved about the carrots, but the best presentation went to my mom's rosemary lamb chops. \u00a0They are uncovered as they come to the table and a wonderful smokey smell billows out. \u00a0You can't really go wrong with any desert option here, the chocolate pot de creme, the warm chocolate souffle and the the green apple sorbet drizzled with olive oil was so refreshing and delicious, great combination.\u00a0I found the service to be very attentive and polite.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/nAr4LtGY7ouFgZKkpjQUVA\/348s.jpghttp:\/\/s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/yiFN2sUmZDKuHtfX_HcAWA\/168s.jpghttp:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/EuMdq9QP8NF8pxLiwW-Dfw\/168s.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>And lastly, \"I came here on a Sunday for brunch with my husband.\u00a0My hubby has a big appetite so we each ordered a dish AND a side. \u00a0I ordered the truffled scrambled eggs (served with side salad) and a side of the cured salmon. He ordered the salmon poached eggs with a side of the applewood bacon. The side of salmon was HUGE - it could be a meal in itself! It was extremely fresh, as well and was served with a yummy dill cream. My eggs were delicious and served in a skillet atop a wooden cutting board. I thought the cutting board was cute but impractical as my salad greens kept falling off of it onto the table. :-\/<\/p> <p><br\/>They do have a pre-fixe brunch menu but we opted not to do that because the meals we wanted weren't offered AND we didn't want dessert. The coffee here was great, although not super hot.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Good meal, beautiful place. We ended up leaving pretty full. AND - if you book on OpenTable you can pay from your phone without waiting to receive the bill from your server.

Come on time or even a little early, as it can be difficult to save seats.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/shutupandwriteNYC\/events\/227348528\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"name":"NYC Shut Up & Write Meetup! - Columbus Circle","id":"cxklflyvcbfb","time":1451869200000,"updated":1451932827000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1284414674000,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

You can\u2019t luck your way into an amazing relationship just like you can\u2019t luck your way into an Ivy League University.<\/p> <p>Are you willing to put in the effort and become successful with women, a leader of men and a boss in social situations? If so, you\u2019ve come to the right place.<\/p> <p>Here is the path to success with women:<\/p> <p><b>Step 1 is everything that happens before you open your mouth.<\/b><\/p> <p>Most guys think that they look presentable, but truth be told, most guys are clueless of how to present themselves to women. If you don't dress and present the body language of someone she would date, you've got no chance and she'll immediately rule you out.<\/p> <p>We walk around making snap judgements of people all the time. \u00a0You\u2019re sitting in a restaurant scanning the room thinking\u00a0<i>\u201cThere\u2019s an old waitress, fat chick, cute hostess with a nice little tush, sloppy looking dude, short, broke bus boy, rich old guy, etc\u2026\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p>You\u2019re not the only one doing the judging, they are judging you too.<\/p> <p>Women have a forcefield that protects them from ineligible suitors and the number one factor the forcefield discriminates against is your appearance.<\/p> <p>You don't have to be good looking, but you must look good.<\/p> <p>If your body language is confident and you know how to dress, you can fake the funk enough to get past the forcefield of most beautiful women.<\/p> <p>But if your fashion sucks and its obvious that you don\u2019t quite fit in, you\u2019ll never even get your foot in the door.<\/p> <p><b>Step 2 is what we call Social Protocol.<\/b><\/p> <p>Social protocol is the established code of procedure or behavior in any group, organization, or social situation. \u00a0If you do not follow social protocol, you will trigger the second layer of someone\u2019s forcefield.<\/p> <p>Your appearance will get you in the door, but the wrong behavior will get you booted right back out.<\/p> <p>Having a mastery of social protocol is something that can take years, even decades to accomplish. \u00a0If you want an example look at successful politicians. \u00a0Successful politicians rarely slip up in social situations and they have the ability to make everyone they meet feel important and like their best friend. \u00a0They are dynamic, interesting, engaging and attentive. In order for a politician to be successful he\/she must win over the majority of people to keep their job.<\/p> <p>Politics isn\u2019t for everyone but in order to attract the right people into your life, you have to understand the level of social protocol in order to fit in. \u00a0Social protocol is made up of many factors: How you engage people, how you say hello, goodbye, where you sit at a table, how you shake someone\u2019s hand, where you wait outside of a club, when you ask a woman for a phone number, when you go for a kiss, how to introduce your friends to each other, how you order a drink, how you split a tab, the list goes on and on and on. \u00a0There is even a recognizable vernacular for different groups of people.<\/p> <p>If you want to follow \"cool people\" social protocol, you have to learn the \"cool people\" vernacular. \u00a0If you want to fit in with a bunch of techie geeks, you have to talk like a techie geek.<\/p> <p>If you still believe there is a quick fix for a guy who doesn\u2019t understand social protocol I hope you can see the flaw in your logic. \u00a0You cannot have a mastery of social protocol over night because you must learn the rules which takes time and exposure.<\/p> <p>The key to really being a master at any skill is to understand the rules so well that you know how to break them.<\/p> <p>Step 3 is to learn to not give a shit and you'll embody \"cool.\"<\/p> <p>Cool is defined as this: marked by steady dispassionate calmness and self-control. \u00a0In other words, someone who doesn't give a shit and knows when and when not to get excited. \u00a0When you learn social protocol and interact with hundreds and hundreds of people in social situations the anxiety and nervousness you once felt will fade away.<\/p> <p>You will no longer fear rejection and thriving in social situations will become second nature to you...<\/p> <p>The key to really being a master at any skill is to understand the rules so well that you know how to break them.<\/p> <p>We will go much further in depth into these topics during the meetup and you'll walk away with a roadmap of how to become a man who is loved by women and envied by other men.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Date-Like-A-Boss-Attract-The-Most-Beautiful-Women-In-NYC\/events\/227577313\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"3 Strategies To Meet Women, Bypass Their \"Forcefields\" & Get In The Money Zone","id":"227577313","time":1451869200000,"updated":1451934923000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1358607870000,"name":"Date Like A Boss - Attract The Most Beautiful Women In NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":6735642,"urlname":"Date-Like-A-Boss-Attract-The-Most-Beautiful-Women-In-NYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Bosses"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"240 West 35th St.","name":"Jack Doyle's","lon":-73.991638,"id":14819082,"state":"NY","lat":40.752289,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.18024289608,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451313530000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WOOOHOOO!!!!

With such great insights being generated, it\u2019s truly a shame if they go unheard or misunderstood. In this talk, Matt will discuss the pitfalls of communicating data in a large organization, the best ways to tell a compelling story with data, and the elements of the BI stack that will help you do it. With references to industry giants like Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, and Bret Victor, you can expect to learn how new and old ideas are driving modern storytelling.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Speaker Biography: Matt Monihan is on the product team at RJMetrics, a business intelligence company in Philadelphia.

Huxley's bold, nontraditional narrative tells the loosely autobiographical story of Anthony Beavis, a cynical libertine Oxford graduate who comes of age in the vacuum left by World War I. Unfulfilled by his life, loves, and adventures, Anthony is persuaded by a charismatic friend to become a Marxist and take up arms with Mexican revolutionaries. But when their disastrous embrace of violence nearly kills them, Anthony is left shattered\u2014and is forced to find an alternative to the moral disillusionment of the modern world.\u00a0<\/p>

All are welcomed, beginners are encouraged. there is no better time to start learning than the present, it gets easier the more you do it!<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchesters-country-line-and-partner-dancing-group\/events\/227445984\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Review and learn new line dances","id":"rspzclyvcbgb","time":1451950200000,"updated":1451961890000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1411602989000,"name":"Westchester's country line and partner dancing group","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":17195712,"urlname":"Westchesters-country-line-and-partner-dancing-group","group_lat":41.1699981689,"who":"Happy dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11206","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"17 Meadow St.","name":"The Paper Box","lon":-73.936607,"id":16697602,"state":"NY","lat":40.710857,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.89759612083,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449499285000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>FREE\u00a0Comedy.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0dopest\u00a0entertainment.\u00a0<\/p> <p>And a\u00a0cool\u00a0ass audience.<\/p> <p>Brooklyn, STAND UP!!!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hosted by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.kerrycoddett.com\/\">Kerry Coddett<\/a>\u00a0(Comedy Central, MTV2)<\/p> <p>Doors open at 6:30 PM<\/p> <p>Each month, we have the best and brightest comics from Comedy Central, Conan, SNL, MTV and more.

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled. Because of this, the facilitators and\u00a0participants of this group will be expected to keep member identities,\u00a0meeting locations, and content confidential to protect everyone\u00a0involved.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality and safety of our group members, please email [masked] with the following questionnaire for the location details.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Member Questionnaire:<\/b><br\/>In an effort to ensure all members of this group are respectful and\u00a0open to others, we ask that you fill out this short questionnaire so\u00a0the organizers can tailor the group to its members. We have a\u00a0zero-tolerance policy for evangelism at our meetings; people attending\u00a0for the sake of evangelizing will be asked to leave. We do this in an\u00a0effort to protect our members and ensure that our group is a safe\u00a0space for all attendees.<\/p> <p>This is NOT an application, all serious members will be invited regardless of answers to the questions below.<\/p> <p>1. Why are you interested in\u00a0Beyond Faith?<\/p> <p>2.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/227467489\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvcbhb","time":1452034800000,"updated":1452046474000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"401 Broadway, Suite 1600 ","name":"Fiverr HQ","lon":-73.953819,"id":23739183,"state":"NY","lat":40.707027,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":135,"headcount":0,"distance":3.5293200016,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":11,"created":1450202586000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>ALTERNATIVE LINK TO ATTEND IS BELOW<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-entrepreneur-networking-mixer-fiverr-tickets-19459287252\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-entrepreneur-networking-mixer-fiverr-tickets-19459287252\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-entrepreneur-networking-mixer-fiverr-tickets-19459287252<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/0\/5\/600_441058373.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Unwind after work with some beer and wine on us.<\/p> <p>Meet new people, share ideas, and network with others in the tech community.<\/p> <p>Take a tour of the office and learn about how <b>fiverr<\/b> can help your business.<\/p> <p>*Get 20% off your first order on <b>fiverr<\/b> just by attending!<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Event Organizers<\/p> <p><b>fiverr.com<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Graphics, marketing, fun, and more online services, on budget and on time.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\">www.fiverr.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>LawTrades<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Hire an elite business lawyer in\u00a0minutes.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawtrades.com\/\">www.lawtrades.com<\/a><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>*Text\u00a0MIXER\u00a0to[masked]\u00a0for chance to win $500 off your next legal bill.<\/p> <p><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Startup-CEO-CTO-Meetup\/events\/227437235\/","yes_rsvp_count":135,"duration":7200000,"name":"Startup & Entrepreneur Networking Mixer @ Fiverr","id":"227437235","time":1452034800000,"updated":1452045520000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1404179806000,"name":"NYC Startup CEO \/ CTO Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":15427252,"urlname":"NYC-Startup-CEO-CTO-Meetup","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"CEOs\/CTOs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.73755836487,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450200105000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet downstairs in the seating area.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Practice-Hindi\/events\/227436622\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Evening Practice Hindi","id":"227436622","time":1452034800000,"updated":1452134662000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449759850000,"name":"Practice Hindi","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":19200391,"urlname":"Practice-Hindi","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"224 West 4th street","address_2":"Second Floor","name":"fat cat fab lab","lon":-74.00296,"id":14148372,"state":"NY","lat":40.733955,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.30262732506,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1397552281000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Open House Tuesdays are hosted by autodidact and skill hoarder,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hartmanncomputer.com\/\">Peter Hartmann<\/a>. \u00a0\u00a0Mingle, tinker, model, lase, 3d print, show, tell, learn, play, and ask questions.

OR you can just show up that night and sit wherever there is space available.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Hope to see YOU at the movies!!\u00a0 Love, Cassie<\/p> <p><b><i>if you can't make it, no need to post why.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/227468116\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjyvcbhb","time":1452036600000,"updated":1452048714000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"431 6th Ave","name":"Park Slope Library","lon":-73.983582,"id":18760222,"state":"NY","lat":40.668282,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.66781711578,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449772665000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Living in a city where one is constantly \u2018on\u2019 and looking to do more and more, a workshop that will recharge you and open you up to tap into a practical way to refresh every day, so you can do more of the things you love doing.<\/p> <p>Each one of us possesses the ability to calm the mind and recharge the body within minutes.

natural, instinctive movement which strengthens and restores the body, clarifies the mind, and provides a framework for healthy, safe, life-long activity\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the instructor\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Jim has over 25 years of martial arts experience in various styles including Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ), Silat, Boxing, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Karate.\u00a0 He is

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

BUT PLEASE COME AND LISTEN IN. WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU!<\/p> <p><br\/>The last one was so much fun...we are doing it again!<\/p> <p><br\/>Learn to improve your photography through a gentle and honest interactive online photo critique led by professional photographer, Vickie Lewis.<\/p> <p>Here is the link to attend:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\"><a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/global.gotomeeting.com\/join\/769819077\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;You can also dial in using your phone.<\/p> <p>United States\u00a0+1 (224)[masked]<\/p> <p>Access Code:\u00a0[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>The very best way to take your photography to the next level is to get personal feedback. These critiques are a great place to feel safe, talk about your work and get constructive feedback.<br\/>Vickie has been a full-time professional photographer and editor for over 30 years and has shot over 150 portraits for People Magazine. Her work is represented by The National Geographic image collection.<br\/>To assure personal attention during the critiques, we are going to limit the number of photographers being critiqued to five. Photographers being critiqued will be able to interact with Vickie and get their questions answered.<br\/>We\u2019ll using gotomeeting.com. It requires downloading a viewer on your computer. I will post the link to go meeting before December 10th.<\/p> <p>I've been doing critiques for a long time and realize that just listening can be educational too and so we are inviting all our Meetup group members to view the critiques for free.<br\/>The first five photographers who sign up to be critiqued will send 8-10 photos via email. Send your best, a recent shoot or something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. Due to time limitations, we probably won\u2019t critiqued all the photos each photographer submits, but we like to have a selection to look at to help you improve. We will make sure those who choose to participate get personal attention.<br\/>It doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something!<br\/>If you\u2019d like to have your photos critiqued, the price is $25 per person.<br\/>Go to this link to sign up:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=K88M9X3ASDRLG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=K88M9X3ASDRLG<\/a><\/p> <p>What past participants have said about critiques:<br\/>\"Fantastic! I was nervous about having my photos critiqued, but Vickie offered suggestions with gentleness and respect. It wasn't painful at all! Listening to her feedback, I had a great \"ah-ha\" moment about what I need to do to take my work to the next level. I'm so grateful to have had this opportunity to personally interact with a respected and experienced professional at such a bargain price. I will definitely do it again if the opportunity comes around again!\"<\/p> <p>\"I enjoyed the webinar and it was very informative. It made me look at my photos in a different way along with understanding focal point. I would take another webinar with Vickie. Thank you.\"<\/p> <p>\"I enjoyed this session very much. Vickie has such a good eye it's amazing! There was a nice balance between recommendations for improvement and pointing out what was good. We saw some outstanding photos, I hope the other photographers will post some of them.\"<\/p> <p>\u201cOnce again, our group provided a rewarding way to learn. Each one of our members showed interesting photographs, along with unique approaches to the subject matter. Vickie gave us valuable feedback, and it was the feedback that we all needed. If you want to belong to a social and educational photo Meetup, try this one!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cA very enjoyable evening. I learned a lot!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cGreat evening! It was good to see everyone and I enjoyed everyone's work. It very helpful to me get reactions from other folks to improve my pictures.<\/p> <p>\u201cSo interesting to see how cropping can move a photo from good to wow! A thoroughly enjoyable evening. Thanks for such an enjoyable discussion.\u201d<\/p> <p>Great feedback! Great to see other photographer's work and viewpoints.<\/p> <p>\u201cAll, thank you for a great experience and the great suggestions. I'm using them already and got many new ideas from all the wonderful photos.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cAs usual, I was impressed and inspired by everyone's photos. I also picked up a couple new tips, so it was a great night!\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThank you all for a wonderful evening! Beautiful photos, great tips and a great group!

After 24 hours, if there are less than or equal to 4 people signed up I will move everyone to the going list and afterwards signing up will be like normal. If there are more than 4 people, I will give priority to those who have previously been on the waitlist and were not able to attend a prior meetup. I do sign ups this way so everyone has a chance to attend events. I know I tend to post things late at night and want morning people to also get to come to events.<\/p> <p><b>The Place: <\/b>Sister to soul-food spot Peaches, this Bed-Stuy poultry purveyor has a smaller space and shorter menu, but shares the focus on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients. The interior, like the food, centers on nostalgia for simpler things: A cloud-gray room hosts wraparound picnic-style benches, and a scuffed hardwood floor complements a down-home service style. The kitchen doles out a collection of the usual high-end rib-stickers: sweet slabs of cornbread that taste more like cake; fried green tomatoes dressed with sprigs of arugula, barbecue mayo, and thick strips of bacon; large, juicy shrimp covered in mild barbecue sauce over fried-grits cubes; a bowl of creamed corn garnished with that same wonderful bacon. House cocktails that lean on bourbon, mashed blueberries, and sweet tea make for excellent chasers. Peaches' fare isn't always exceptional: Shrimp and grits with plainclothes Cheddar lacks any discernible kick, and greens, like a bland side bowl of saut\u00e9ed kale, play second string. The kitchen\u2019s famous fried-chicken plate, on the other hand, consists of three pieces stacked over a slab of white bread and dusted with a spice so red it almost glows. While the \u201chot\u201d variety is surprisingly mild, the \u201cextra hot\u201d option warrants a special note: Try it if you dare, but don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.<b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>RSVPs: <\/b><\/p> <p>Please do not RSVP No. You only need to RSVP if you want to come to the event.<\/p> <p>Please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can go. I notice the people who RSVP and then cancel, which is not fair to everyone else. I reserve the right to give priority to people who don't do this in the future. I'm not trying to be mean but it makes it much harder for me when people take spots and then cancel either quickly or last minute. Obviously more notice is better but please try to only sign up (for waitlist as well) if you know you can come.<\/p> <p>Even if the meetup is full, please put your name on the waitlist. I always give priority to people on the waitlist if spots open up. If there are a lot of people on the waitlist I will try to get more seats, although for reservations made far in advance I am unlikely to be able to do so. At very least it will let me know what kinds of restaurants are popular so I can schedule more of those in the future.

Many people are also aware of using EFT for physical well being. Sometimes we need to look at the emotional aspects that may be behind the issues of concern, and sometimes we just tap directly on the symptoms and notice if we get relief just from that. Its very nice when this happens and it happens a lot.<\/p> <p>Tong Ren is another form of healing using tapping but unlike EFT it doesnt involve any dialog to describe the issues of concern. We just tap on a surragate model (Tong Ren) as if we were doing acupunture on a real body with intention of healing and it works!!!!<\/p> <p>We'll meet at Jain's home in Scarsdale every 2nd and 4th Tuesday evening and whoever is interested in joining us is welcome.

How likely is it?<\/p> <p>Our lifestyle and civilization rely on steady supplies of electricity and an electricity grid was created to supply that electricity. Our society is increasingly reliant on computers and the grid is no exception to that. There have been several articles online about the grid being vulnerable to a cyber-attack and how a dam in Rye, NY did indeed get a cyber-attack. So did a portion of the grid in California. Is the Indian Point nuclear plant vulnerable as well?<\/p> <p>I will explore that with Michel Lee, who has been studying just how vulnerable the grid is. Michel is Chair of the Council on Intelligent Energy &amp; Conservation Policy (CIECP) and on the Steering Committee of the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition (IPSEC). Joining us will be Rob from the Wednesday night WBAI program \"Off the Hook,\" giving us more in-depth knowledge of hacking.<\/p> <p>Here are links to some of the articles Michel will be referring to.

It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p><br\/>There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com\"><b>www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com<\/b><\/a> and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage!<\/p> <p><br\/>The <b>CSC<\/b> is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established.

It\u2019s about designing a system of\u00a0constraints for people to ask the right questions, find purpose in their work,\u00a0and be empowered to make decisions and\u00a0constantly learn &amp; improve\u00a0through\u00a0experimentation and failure.<\/p> <p>\u201dLearning organizations are organizations\u00a0where people continually expand their capacity to design for the results they\u00a0truly desire;\u00a0where new and expansive mindsets are nurtured, where collective\u00a0aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to\u00a0see the\u00a0whole together instead of optimizing for the parts.\u201d \u2013 Peter Senge<br\/>\u00a0\nWhen people talk about the\u00a0application of Lean principles to knowledge work like software, what\u00a0immediately comes to mind?\u00a0Perhaps \u201cvisualize your work,\u201d using visual\u00a0management systems like Kanban? Perhaps the idea of removing waste from the\u00a0system\u00a0to increase flow of value? While both of these are incredible powerful\u00a0tools, many software companies believe that simple installing\u00a0Kanban boards\u00a0will move their organization forward. The reality is that it\u2019s missing the most\u00a0important aspect of the Lean (or the\u00a0Toyota Production System), which is the\u00a0use of A3 to create a continuously improving, learning organization.<\/p> <p>As Jim Womack from the Lean\u00a0Enterprise Institute says, \"The most basic definition of an A3 would be a\u00a0P-D-C-A storyboard or\u00a0report. The broader notion of the A3 as a\u00a0process\u2013embodying the way of thinking represented in the format\u2013captures the\u00a0heart of\u00a0lean management. In this context, an A3 document structures effective\u00a0and efficient dialogue that fosters understanding followed by\u00a0the opportunity\u00a0for deep agreement.\u201d<\/p> <p>This two hour introductory\u00a0workshop designed by PraxisFlow, will introduce the basics of design thinking\u00a0and A3, unpacking the\u00a0concepts and tools to introduce it into your\u00a0organization.

What if we can change this perception and help PHP \/ Drupal developers architect a content platform that is high performance and low cost, high security and low maintenance? This talk will focus on 3 key topics: 1) serverless environment, 2) microservices architecture and 3) hands-on demos. We will describe a serverless solution and propose a scalable architecture that will help Drupal community to adopt cloud-native approach without huge efforts or expensive resources allocation.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bio<\/b><br\/>Eugene Istrati has spent over 15 years as a technologist in a variety of industries, including digital media, cloud computing, and reputation marketing.

Learn why using data-driven practices are important and leave knowing how to articulate how the social sector can leverage data to measure their impact.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 2 (Jan. 13): Assessment Phase &amp; Logic Models<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Dissecting programs through a critical analysis helps to articulate the core components of any initiative, including inputs, outputs, and expected outcomes \u2013 also known as conducting a Logic Model or Theory of Change.\u00a0 Determine what data you already track and what data still needs to be collected for each component. Explore the complementary aspects of regular data collection, and targeted, periodic evaluation.<\/p> <p><b><i>Week 3 (Jan. 20): Transforming Programming into Measureable Outcomes &amp; Outputs<\/i>\u00a0<\/b>Want to make sure your measurement tools are as efficient as possible? First, you need to make sure you are asking the right questions. In this training, we start by breaking down your program\u2019s purpose and mission. Throughout the process we train nonprofit professionals to be strategic when designing an evaluation. Participants will leave with a set of variables\/indicators to be used in a survey or interview and discuss how they could be best measured.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 4 (Jan. 27): Designing Measurement Tools Using a Mixed-Methods Approach<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Sometimes, numbers can give you a good indication of how well an organization is doing, but it\u2019s not always the whole story. Organizations need to also support evidence of their impact with humanizing stories and real-world anecdotes of how their program changes lives. Explore the complementary aspects of quantitative and qualitative research and be ready to address your own biases!\u00a0 Learn about mixed methods approaches and how to develop measurement tools that actually capture the results you are looking to measure.<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 5 (Feb. 3): Organizing, Managing, and Analyzing Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Once you have collected your data, the next step is to take it from raw data to aggregate results. It is imperative to value the methodologies of this process over simply obtaining advanced statistical technological programs. Learning how to handle your data and manage any pitfalls that occurred during the implementation phase will help you maximize the data you have collected.\u00a0 This will also mitigate the effects of any less-than-perfect implementations. Learn more advanced methodologies to help you ensure your analysis is sound and impress stakeholders.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Week 6 (Feb. 10): Storytelling Using Data<\/b><\/i>\u00a0Having aggregate data of your evaluation is not enough. This session will teach you how to craft this data in a format that effectively conveys your true impact. Understanding how to present your results to a variety of audiences ensures your efforts are communicated in the best light. Learn how to take your results to the next level by analyzing your audience and customizing your data to convince all stakeholders that you are making a real impact.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BX7ETbNlQjo0vlCzlzLnQ4yHqAUPLKQ8bTvsewbmHqjLLMIkHh7C6UawWUPPro7fuT1QJgkUs3k_qsDIbilLmCGNJ9nOinBQkjWf3MbCu_XFEtAFsQQOg-ktrGlyGeGKEkJ8uBg0<\/a><\/p> <p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.evaluateforchange.com\/\"><b>Evaluate for Change<\/b><\/a>, we are dedicated to shifting the social sector towards a more data-driven and results-oriented industry, all while remembering people are more than just numbers!

YEP! is a hybrid networking organization. At one time the co-founders were members of NY MPI, NY EPA, NY ISES, NY NACE, NY ABC, DC ISES, DC NACE, and NYC &amp; Company. They adopted the best practices of each of those organizations to maximize the growth and effectiveness of YEP!. We welcome all suggestions and debate. It is likely that we have considered a number of policies and procedures before selecting the most appropriate for YEP!.<\/p> <p>2. YEP! is an LLC that\u00a0minimizes overhead. The purpose of YEP! is to create new leadership opportunities for event professionals, provide quality low-cost events, and help members in their careers and businesses. Because we don't have employees, or high monthly expenses, events just have to break even. Plus, there is no membership fee.<\/p> <p>3. Everyone is welcome, everyone is welcome back and everyone is included. The most important part of genuine networking is participation, either as leaders or attendees at our events. We welcome all of our attendees to be participants at our events and on our leadership board. We find opportunities for all those who wish to serve. Our terms of leadership are only six months.<\/p> <p>4. There are no advisory positions. Leaders either embrace an on-going responsibility or assume significant responsibility for an event. Our leaders are given\u00a0a platform and a space from which they can showcase their abilities and the abilities of other sponsors and individuals. We are not limited to one event per month. We are only limited by our imagination and ability to organize.<\/p> <p>Requirements for Board Members<\/p> <p>1. Attendance at monthly meetings. Meetings are the first Wednesday of each month in Manhattan, 6:30 - 8 p.m. We realize leaders might have other more pressing obligations and miss a meeting on occasion. Leaders are expected to commit to attend most, arrange their schedules to accommodate this responsibility, and make YEP! a priority.<\/p> <p>2. All board members must either serve in a defined leadership position or assume responsibility for an event.<\/p> <p>3. Board members must be responsive to emails.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.
