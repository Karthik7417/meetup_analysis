We also like to meet up with people who just want to eat, drink, dance, or socialize with music in the background. The exact nature of the jam will depend on who is participating and where it is held, but the goal is to play with minimal discussion and no preparation. Don't expect any level of skill or familiarity, so no covers. This style of play does result in some rough patches. We develop a strange appreciation of these rough spots; however, the goal is to find grooves. We don't mind riding through some mess, but we also try to hold onto those groovy riffs. We shoot for something between the chaotic, dissonant nature of free improvisation and the tedium of practiced music. At the end of the day, it is just supposed to be fun. Nobody should ever tell anyone else they are messing up. But at the same time, everyone should be trying to play in such a way that it is easy for others to work with. This might mean playing simple repetitive patterns with a limited set of tones (or keeping a steady beat on the drums). No theory is necessary, but if you are curious, look into the Circle of Fifths, pentatonic scales, and keys. We like to switch around on the instruments. It is helpful if everyone is willing to play drums for a bit (drumming the whole time can be tiresome). Anyway, hopefully that long description didn't scare you away.

The goal is to have fun, learn how to do it and ultimately get on the road to home ownership!","lon":-71.4300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":199976386,"name":"Amanda Graham","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/2\/a\/highres_254000010.jpeg","photo_id":254000010,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/2\/a\/member_254000010.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/2\/a\/thumb_254000010.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"Metro West  First Time Home Buyers","id":19626094,"state":"MA","urlname":"metrowestfirsttimehomebuyer","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"First Time Home Buyers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brighton","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456452555000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"asian-singles","name":"Asian Singles","id":22323},{"urlkey":"single-asian-professionals","name":"Single Asian Professionals","id":44633},{"urlkey":"south-asians","name":"South Asians","id":59847},{"urlkey":"asian-culture","name":"Asian Culture","id":66881},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584},{"urlkey":"professional-single-asian-men","name":"Professional Single Asian Men","id":93625},{"urlkey":"asian-americans-30s-40s","name":"Asian Americans 30s 40s","id":96694},{"urlkey":"asian-food","name":"Asian Food","id":100997},{"urlkey":"asian-american-social","name":"Asian American Social","id":121143},{"urlkey":"asian-professionals-and-singles","name":"Asian Professionals and Singles","id":161947}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asian-Alphas\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for Asian\/Asian-American men looking to network with peers and make new friends beyond a professional setting.

Whether you are Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian or any other type of Asian, I'd love to have you join. The Asian-American narrative is starting to shift in the US, and solidarity is more important than ever. Whether you are an American-born Asian, or a recent immigrant, young or old...It doesn't matter. We can all learn from each other and help each other out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think it's pathetic that Asians make more money than any other group in this country, yet have almost no voice in politics, Hollywood and general pop culture. Let's change that.<\/p>\n<p>Once this group reaches a respectable number, I'll initiate a meetup in the Greater Boston area, typically in Boston Proper, Cambridge, or Somerville. There will be happy hours, cigars, dinners, and much more to come.

Important to note, we plan to learn and train at half\/full-speed and physical contact will be incorporated into drills. We plan to use specific source material (to be discussed at first meetup) to create loose training plans around established and well-defined basics, skills, and drills.<\/p> \n<p>Please consider joining if this description interests you and you're serious about building some basic skills, based on real-world scenarios, with like-minded people.

LOCS features 60-75 minute workshops\/sessions focusing on various topics impacting our community. The 4th Annual LOCS will be held on Saturday, March 19, 2016. LOCS Collective\u2019s purpose is to address the gross disparities that exist regarding access to community and resources for LBTQ women of color in Boston and surrounding areas. Concurrently, there are few organizations dedicated to providing services solely to LBTQ women of color. Our vision is to create spaces\/platforms for LBTQ identified women of color in Boston and surrounding areas to celebrate our vibrant culture, solidify our community and increase our visibility. We do this by: Developing partnerships with regional and national organizations that serve and support LBTQ identified women of color and streamlining their resources into our communities. Encouraging supportive and respectful discussions within and outside our community. Empowering through activism, education and networking. ALLY PRIDE: In addition to uplifting LBTQ communities of color we also recognize the undeniable necessity to foster genuine and wholesome relationships with our allies, charging ourselves as well as other communities to actively advocate for one another. We encourage community collaboration and development.

My 20+ year's of research into what ails America has led me to publish a book \u201cCulture War Cracked\u201d to broadcast my shocking conclusion that what conservatives know of as the \"Culture War\" is in fact King George's Counter-American Revolution being waged secretly. He established his bulwarks against our Constitution at Fortress Harvard, switched his ammo from black powder to white powder (opium) and his loyalists have been waging a self-funding, perpetual war against our freedoms for hundreds of years. So, clearly I need some face-to-face time to prove myself out, as my thesis must sound like quite a stretch! But seriously, my book proves this out by connecting the dots with details of our history that\u2019ve been hidden from view. I posted the press release at SavingATB.com (short for Saving America the Beautiful). Free PDF download of my 98 page book, Culture War Cracked, at 911BloodTrail.com. Once I get enough interested, I hope to have meetings in and around Boston. I anticipate multiple meet-ups each month since this topic is huge and this election is marching forward. I can imagine holding them in places like Boston, Framingham, Peabody, Burlington, Waltham, Dedham and Quincy. This all depends of interest level though. To peek your interest in the subjects we\u2019ll discuss, I have reverse engineered the Culture War and can shatter both the Establishment Class and the New World Order with relative ease. It just took lots of Googling and plenty of inspiration. And I have found the King\u2019s bloody thumbprints all over our academia, which he infiltrated from Harvard on down, to pump his addictive white powder and transform our nation into one of dependency and addiction. So, I have solutions to win the drug war and save lives by keeping kids straight. I hope to meet you!

All that they have ever accomplished or attained has been done in full accordance with this most powerful law.\n\nWithout exception, every human being has the ability to transform any weakness or suffering into strength, power, perfect peace, health, and abundance.\n\nRhonda Byrne's discovery of The Secret began with a glimpse of the truth through a 100 year old book. She went back through centuries, tracing and uncovering a common truth that lay at the core of the most powerful philosophies, teachings and religions in the world.\n\nWhat Rhonda discovered is now captured in The Secret, a film that has been viewed by millions around the world. The Secret has also been released as an audio-book and printed book with more than six million copies in print.\n\nThe Secret explains with simplicity the law that is governing all lives, and offers the knowledge of how to create - intentionally and effortlessly - a joyful life. This is the secret to everything - the secret to unlimited happiness, love, health and prosperity.\n\nThis is the secret to life.","lon":-70.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/7\/8\/highres_447649272.jpeg","photo_id":447649272,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/7\/8\/600_447649272.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/7\/8\/thumb_447649272.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":6925152,"name":"Anthony Pasquale","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/5\/1\/highres_5877169.jpeg","photo_id":5877169,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/5\/1\/member_5877169.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/f\/5\/1\/thumb_5877169.jpeg"}},"members":25,"name":"Danvers Law Of Attraction Vision Board Workshops..","id":19680932,"state":"MA","urlname":"Danvers-Law-Of-Attraction-Vision-Board-Workshops","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.5699996948,"who":"LOA Visionarys Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Salem","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457465847000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salem-Small-Business-Social\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in relaxed networking on Boston's North Shore.

This isn't to impugn anyone who fits these categories. I feel like these attitudes have a part to play in political discourse. However, I've been finding it harder to find nuanced discussion in both the media, and, sometimes, even, in everyday life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>This Meetup is an attempt to rectify that, find people who are similarly interested, and get together and talk. While I don't imagine this group to be directly activist, if people want to use it to meet others with similar outlooks who are interested in organizing, I think that would be great.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'll admit, I don't have an exact definition of a moderate. Thus, if the title rings true to you, please take the leap and come on down. This group is intended to be non-partisan - Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Party members, are all welcome. In my opinion, and my experience, most people are moderates not because they lack passion for their beliefs, or because of any particular ideology, but because they understand many different points of view and respect the nuance and difficulty of dealing with complex issues.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As you may have guessed, this is a bit of an experiment, so the shape of the group will most likely change over time. To start, I imagine we'll have a topic and perhaps some reading beforehand so that people can have a general reference point for the discussion (I'm thinking articles, not whole books). But, if people are interested, join, send me a message, and let me know what interests you so that we can figure out a way to make this work.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10881692,"name":"Kevin Schwartz","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/highres_13635351.jpeg","photo_id":13635351,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/member_13635351.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/b\/f\/7\/thumb_13635351.jpeg"}},"members":81,"name":"Moderate Politics Meetup","id":19699778,"state":"MA","urlname":"Moderate-Liberal-Politics-Meetup","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.4000015259,"who":"Moderates"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Malden","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457902009000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"game-night","name":"Game Night","id":40126},{"urlkey":"portable-gaming","name":"Portable Gaming","id":612322}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/portable-gaming-of-greater-boston\/","rating":0,"description":"this group will meetup and play games on systems like nintendo 3ds ps vita etc","lon":-71.0599975586,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":157247142,"name":"matt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/highres_254732932.jpeg","photo_id":254732932,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/member_254732932.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/0\/a\/4\/thumb_254732932.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"portable gaming of greater boston","id":19703514,"state":"MA","urlname":"portable-gaming-of-greater-boston","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":42.4300003052,"who":"gamers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Medfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1457966241000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"rc","name":"Radio Control","id":1667},{"urlkey":"rc-racing","name":"RC Racing","id":34121},{"urlkey":"rc-planes-remote-controlled","name":"RC Planes: Remote Controlled","id":81885},{"urlkey":"rc-helicopters-remote-controlled-helis","name":"RC Helicopters: Remote Controlled Helis","id":81886},{"urlkey":"uav","name":"UAV","id":139340},{"urlkey":"drones","name":"Drones","id":1162902},{"urlkey":"multi-rotor-aircraft","name":"Multi-Rotor Aircraft","id":1311042},{"urlkey":"unmanned-vehicles","name":"Unmanned Vehicles","id":1410302},{"urlkey":"building-drones","name":"Building Drones","id":1501292},{"urlkey":"uas","name":"UAS","id":1505294}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MetroWest-Drone-Enthusiasts\/","rating":0,"description":"Whether you like the concept of drones, own a drone, or build your own unmanned systems, come join the collective.

Orienteering is a compass and map navigation sport done for exercise and fun. Participants are challenged to find a series of unique three-sided flags hidden on various courses in a park or a forest using only a map, compass, and their wits. The sport is enjoyed by walkers, hikers, runners, and families with kids. All events are timed, but it is up to each participant to decide whether to casually walk a course, or run it like it was their own personal amazing race. Very easy, beginner, and intermediate orienteering courses, along with training on how to use a compass and read a topography map, occur at all New England Orienteering (NEOC) events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>The New England Orienteering Club is an all volunteer non-profit dedicated to promoting the sport of orienteering.

I started this group to introduce more people to delicious vegan food and how to cook. We'll get together from time to time at my home in Milton to cook a delicious meal together and then eat it. Hopefully, with lots of casual conversation and plenty of opportunities to learn how to make your own delicious food without being intimidated by ingredients you've never heard of. I'll pull together a menu (suggestions welcome) and a cost per person, then buy the ingredients and the group with come over to make and eat great meal together. Everything will be vegan in a very non-threatening, no superiority or hostility environment where you take a break from being a carnivore. Or, if you're already vegetarian or vegan, learn how to cook those dishes that seem a little intimidating. Emphasis is on: good food, learning how to cook, and an enjoyable meal with people open to new things!<\/p>\n<p><b>Please note: this is not a \"healthy food\" club.<\/b> There are lots of people who see vegan food only as a holistic natural lifestyle that is filled with beautiful vegetables and great health. This club isn't for those people. &nbsp;Rather, this club is for people who enjoy eating great food and learning how to make it. &nbsp;Not nibling on celery sticks with almond butter (although that is a really tasty snack!). So, there is no way that any of the food we'll be making and eating can be classified as \"health food\". &nbsp; If you're looking for a way to shed calories from your diet, this is not the group for you. I am not a health food person, not even remotely. But I'm 100% plant fueled. &nbsp; I'm asking people to pay for being in this club and attending suppers, so I don't want there to be any confusion about the type of vegan food this club will be working with. Of course, the health benefits of a plant-based diet are numerous and significant. &nbsp; Additionally, this is not a group to figure out how to be vegan on a budget. This is a group about eating great food and learning how to cook it with some really nice people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A note about \"dues\" -- Meetup isn't free. &nbsp;In order to create a group, it costs ~$15 a month. &nbsp;Therefore, the dues are to recoup my costs in setting up the group. &nbsp;You only need to pay dues if you want to actually attend an actual Vegan Supper Club Meetup. &nbsp;You can be a member and just wait for a meetup that you'd like to attend: then pay your $5 dues at that time. &nbsp;It doesn't cost anything to be a member of the group, but it will cost $5 a year if you want to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;Hope that makes sense!<\/p>\n<p>Costs: there will be a charge to attend an actual supper. &nbsp;The charge will vary by event, and will be clearly described. &nbsp;I anticipate that it will cost $30-$45 per person for each supper: you get a great 3 course meal, learn about vegan food and how to cook it, great conversation and drinks in a fun environment.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/9\/600_447902425.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/highres_447902467.jpeg","photo_id":447902467,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/600_447902467.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/3\/thumb_447902467.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":193142247,"name":"John T","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/highres_249958762.jpeg","photo_id":249958762,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/member_249958762.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/5\/8\/a\/thumb_249958762.jpeg"}},"members":76,"name":"Boston Vegan Supper Club","id":19717265,"state":"MA","urlname":"BostonVeganSupperClub","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.25,"who":"Supper Club Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"South Weymouth","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458146578000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"makeup","name":"Makeup","id":1481},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"women-beauty","name":"Women & Beauty","id":23642},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"healthy-moms","name":"Healthy Moms","id":26042},{"urlkey":"mind-body-wellness","name":"Mind Body Wellness","id":26120},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"beauty","name":"Beauty","id":63675}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Social-Juniko-Healthy-Women-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"The Social @ Juniko is delighted to provide you with a welcoming, fun and beautiful sanctuary within our boutique fitness facility.

world. &nbsp;Over the past several years our local community has been increasingly underserved and misaligned, so we are trying to do our part by launching a new monthly meetup (and more). &nbsp;We understand that the current community has several various meetups\/events and expect some skepticism, so let us tell you what we are about:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;We are putting this together for practitioners to have a safe place to come meet likeminded people, share cool ideas, and discuss real issues.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 &nbsp;Our events are not a place for marketers, sales men and women, or recruiters . &nbsp;We will politely ask anyone that engages in this behavior to leave (this includes sponsors), unless we have an event specifically designed to engage those relevant parties (e.g., a recruiting event).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Content starts at 7PM, with doors opening at 6PM to socialize. <\/b>Content will be in the form of 2-3 lightening talks (10-20 minutes), with breaks to meet and chat in-between. &nbsp;We aim for content to conclude between 8:15 and 8:30 PM, but will just go with the flow. <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Content will be driven by the community. &nbsp;We also remember that a big part of these events is to bring the community together, so lightining talks are preferred. &nbsp;This will not be a place that you come after work to watch people lecture at you for three hours.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;RSVP's are highly encouraged for our events, but unless specified otherwise all practitioners, or those interested in learning about security, are encouraged to

We also play indoors at the Wayside Racquet and Swim Club, at the Metrowest Boys &amp; Girls Club, at the Northborough Town Offices gym, and at the Boroughs and Greendale YMCA facilities.","lon":-71.5500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201923621,"name":"Dave Brower","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/4\/c\/highres_254961836.jpeg","photo_id":254961836,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/4\/c\/member_254961836.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/4\/c\/thumb_254961836.jpeg"}},"members":29,"name":"Central and Metrowest MA (CAMMP) Pickleball Meetup","id":19739626,"state":"MA","urlname":"Central-and-Metrowest-MA-CAMMP-Pickleball-Meetup","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Pickleball players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Framingham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458587349000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"music","name":"Music","id":15018},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"music-production","name":"Music Production","id":17953},{"urlkey":"recording-music","name":"Recording Music","id":18643},{"urlkey":"industrial-music","name":"Industrial Music","id":28863},{"urlkey":"music-industry","name":"Music Industry","id":50913},{"urlkey":"song-writing","name":"Songwriting","id":72969}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Metrowest-Music-Industry-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Founded by Entertainment Attorney, Musician, and UMASS Lowell professor Ricky Berger, this Meetup is meant to bring Music Business Professionals together in the Metrowest area to provide them with education about the music industry, to&nbsp;<span>support each other in our various artistic and business endeavors, and to enjoy enjoy each other's company.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-71.4300003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":174358342,"name":"Ricky Berger","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/c\/highres_254965212.jpeg","photo_id":254965212,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/c\/member_254965212.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/c\/thumb_254965212.jpeg"}},"members":81,"name":"Metrowest Music Industry Meetup","id":19740160,"state":"MA","urlname":"Metrowest-Music-Industry-Meetup","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":42.3199996948,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458588138000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"non-fiction-writing","name":"Non-fiction writing","id":31732},{"urlkey":"short-story-writing","name":"Short Story Writing","id":35414}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-creative-nonfiction-personal-essay-writing-group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Looking for members to fit with established creative nonfiction\/personal essay group.

In the 1960s we coordinated a major drive to help chiropractors become legally licensed in over 40 states. In the 1970s we waged very successful campaigns against fluoridation. In the 1980s we pushed through legislative recognition of acupuncture. In the 1990s we lobbied to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act S-784, fought malathion spraying, promoted public education on the dangers of vaccinations, and continued fighting the fluoridation battle. In the 2000s we are working to prevent the Codex attempts to restrict your freedom to take vitamins and minerals and we are currently taking action to defeat the Senator Durbin Bill (S.722) that seeks to restrict DSHEA with his move to require dietary supplement manufacturers to submit Adverse Event Reports, to institute a pre-approval process with the FDA for all dietary supplements that are stimulants, and to re-classify anabolic-steroid dietary supplements as Controlled Substances. The other NHF battles include opposing S.1780, S.1538, H.R. 207 and H.R. 3377 (considered the Son of Durbin bill). We are also supporting health-promoting legislation such as the Access To Medical Treatment Act and a repeal of the Kefauver Amendment of 1962 that gave the FDA expanded authority over drug \u201cefficacy\u201d and thus the ability to play favorites with drug companies. We are fighting alongside other countries against a major health freedom threat, one whose goal is to harmonize vitamin and supplement laws that strictly regulate natural health foods worldwide.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4641316,"name":"Mauricio"},"members":20,"name":"The National Health Federation\/Boston, MA.","id":19740552,"state":"MA","urlname":"The-National-Health-Federation-Boston-MA","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Health Freedom Activists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458609712000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classical","name":"Classical Music","id":133},{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"filmind","name":"Film Industry","id":382},{"urlkey":"art","name":"Art","id":1502},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"opera","name":"Opera","id":2812},{"urlkey":"spoken-word","name":"Spoken Word","id":15191},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"singers","name":"Singing","id":17301},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"ballet","name":"Ballet","id":17831},{"urlkey":"social-equality","name":"Social Equality","id":19049},{"urlkey":"diversity-inclusion-communities-businesses","name":"Diversity \/ Inclusion: Communities \/ Businesses","id":20022},{"urlkey":"cultural-diversity","name":"Cultural Diversity","id":22889},{"urlkey":"inclusion","name":"Inclusion","id":583192}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Challenge-the-Stats-Diversifying-Music-Ballet-Film\/","rating":0,"description":"A Boston-based group celebrating diverse artists in the city of Boston and challenging underrepresentation in the classical music, dance, and film.","lon":-71.0699996948,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201949002,"name":"Angelica Hairston","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/8\/3\/highres_254976227.jpeg","photo_id":254976227,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/8\/3\/member_254976227.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/d\/8\/3\/thumb_254976227.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Challenge the Stats (Diversifying Music, Ballet, Film)","id":19741737,"state":"MA","urlname":"Challenge-the-Stats-Diversifying-Music-Ballet-Film","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Supporters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Natick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458611464000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"positive-thinking","name":"Positive Thinking","id":16212},{"urlkey":"motivation","name":"Motivation","id":16433},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"manifestation","name":"Manifestation","id":17449},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"life-coaching","name":"Life Coaching","id":18692},{"urlkey":"subconscious-mind-training","name":"Subconscious Mind Training","id":103487},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Natick-Personal-Achievements-Meetup-Russian-Speaking\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling Russian-speaking community!

Bodhi Meditation has taught me to slow down in life and I have found an inner peace when I practice. &nbsp;My instructors, Sharon and Daphne have been truly wonderful, through their kindness and patience in their teachings. &nbsp;I feel I have &nbsp;more balance &nbsp;in my life when I meditate, not to mention greater focus and more energy. &nbsp;I have also witness the healing power of meditation when suffering from different types of physical ailments. &nbsp;Through my practice, I have gained inner wisdom on how to handle every day stress. &nbsp;I would definitely recommend this program, as I have experienced first hand the benefits of such an inspirational practice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Jadine<\/i><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Free Magazines:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/puti.org\/en\/8_Download\/magazines.html\">http:\/\/puti.org\/en\/8_Download\/magazines.htm...<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-71.1100006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":202058723,"name":"Boston Bodhi Meditation"},"members":52,"name":"Boston Bodhi Meditation","id":19750233,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Bodhi-Meditation","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Watertown","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1458788439000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softball","name":"Softball","id":6574},{"urlkey":"kickball","name":"Kickball","id":8267},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"slow-pitch-softball","name":"Slow Pitch Softball","id":19104},{"urlkey":"coed-soccer","name":"Coed Soccer","id":20557},{"urlkey":"outdoor-soccer","name":"Outdoor Soccer","id":24517},{"urlkey":"coed-kickball","name":"Coed Kickball","id":40940},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-sports-league","name":"Co-Ed Adult Sports League","id":78095},{"urlkey":"co-ed-adult-softball","name":"Co-Ed Adult Softball","id":83507},{"urlkey":"coed-recreational-sports","name":"Coed Recreational Sports","id":89956},{"urlkey":"co-ed-kickball","name":"Co-Ed Kickball","id":93156},{"urlkey":"adult-softball","name":"Adult Softball","id":102419},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"co-ed-recreational-soccer","name":"Co-ed Recreational soccer","id":494112}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HUB-Sports-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"Pick a Day, Pick a Field and join hundreds of teams that will play with the HUB this Spring.

Just kidding, or maybe not? But isn't it always the same 10 people showing up with their eager handshakes, eating the same greasy appetizers, and drinking the same bottle of chardonnay? If that's your cup of tea, then knock yourself out.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I want something different.<\/p>\n<p>Being a new mom has opened my eyes to many things. Some are too gross to share here, but one of the main things that I've come to value is . . . TIME.<\/p>\n<p>Holy crap . . . how humbling (and nerve-racking) is the reality of TIME? It's an unstoppable, non-negotiable force that keeps slipping through our fingers. The tighter you grasp at it the more it slips out of your hand.<\/p>\n<p>I am done wasting TIME at random business meetings, listening to the same stories, surrounding myself with empty smiles. I'd rather play toy trains with my toddler for 10 hours than spend 10 minutes at yet another basic business meeting.<\/p>\n<p><b>\"Stop complaining, Jessica, and doing something about it!\"<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yep, that's right. Instead of being the type of naysayer that sits in the stands, pointing my finger and critiquing the archaic networking efforts of others . . . I'm going to design my own type of networking event.<\/p>\n<p><b>Say hello to Spark! Networkers \u2014 Speed Networking with a TWIST.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Here's a quick rundown . . .<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Gather together at a new location once a month (for now). <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Delicious eats and treats.

NO ONE is going to do business with you unless they trust (and like) you, as a person.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, people see right through the pretty fonts and modern color schemes. You might make an awesome first impression with people, but if you're a total jerk, good luck getting new clients (and friends).<\/p>\n<p>There are pros and cons with business groups and chambers today. For me, the cons outweigh the pros. Of the hundreds of people I've met over the years, there were only a handful with whom I truly felt connected. Everyone else became just another superficial connection on LinkedIn or simply forgotten. Sad, but true.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spark! Networkers<\/b> is my reaction. It's my experiment. It's my mission.<\/p>\n<p>Strip away the professional labels. Eliminate the fakeness. Remove boring conversation that barely scratches the surface. Instead, bring passionate business owners together. Ignite an immediate connection. Cultivate healthy and sustainable relationships. Share our real personality, our desires, our fears . . . our humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Is all this possible in just one night of networking? Who's knows? But we're going to find out, regardless. I invite you to join me, and all the other \"outside of the box\" thinkers.<\/p>\n<p>No membership fees. My events are <b>FREE<\/b> (for the time being) with registration required.<\/p>\n<p>Come with an open mind, and leave with a full heart.<\/p>\n<p>Warmly, <br><\/p>\n<p>Jessica Brand<\/p>\n<p>p.s.<\/p>\n<p>This is not a space for recruiting new contacts or adding people to your email list.

Networkers is not a club for singles looking to mingle. Basically, if you make more than one person feel uncomfortable, I'll have to respectfully block you from the group.<\/p>\n<p>If you reserve a seat at our events and not show up (without prior notice), I'll be bummed. If you do it again, I'll happily remove you from the group.

No experience needed, just the desire to drink, try new things, and bring a beer or two to share!","lon":-71.1600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/9\/f\/highres_450023455.jpeg","photo_id":450023455,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/9\/f\/600_450023455.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/9\/f\/thumb_450023455.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":198709849,"name":"Amy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/b\/7\/highres_255158327.jpeg","photo_id":255158327,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/b\/7\/member_255158327.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/b\/7\/thumb_255158327.jpeg"}},"members":69,"name":"Woburn Craft Beer Meetup","id":19768572,"state":"MA","urlname":"Woburn-Craft-Beer-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Tasters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Lexington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1459197516000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"mindfulness","name":"Mindfulness","id":15920},{"urlkey":"stress-relief","name":"Stress Relief","id":17075},{"urlkey":"breathwork","name":"Breathwork","id":18470},{"urlkey":"breathing-meditation","name":"Breathing Meditation","id":19570},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"mind-body-wellness","name":"Mind Body Wellness","id":26120},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897},{"urlkey":"mindfulness-meditation","name":"Mindfulness Meditation","id":70577}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EYFnow\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Enhance Your Frequency is all about transforming what is not serving us on a cellular level to that which is serving us so that we live life at our highest potential with empowerment and the energy of grace. &nbsp;Our healing center in Lexington, MA is a beautiful, safe, intimate space for private and group healing\/transformation.

It could take the form of augmented reality glasses, it could be an app on a phone or tablet, or it could even be ear buds that actively filter the sound around you and change your perception of reality. There are many ways to enhance a person's sensory experience of the world around them, and all of these ways fall under the \"augmented reality\" umbrella.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>At first glance it is similar to Virtual Reality, but actually quite different. VR looks to immerse the user in a completely separate environment from the one they are in, whereas AR, as just described, wants the user to more firmly be rooted in their world. As the technologies mature, it makes sense to have a meetup dedicated solely to augmented\/mixed reality technologies and conversations. Our goal is not to cannibalize the community, but rather to provide another opportunity for enthusiasts to engage with each other, and for tinkerers and startups to show off their demos for feedback.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>This meetup group is open to ANYONE who is interested in Augmented Reality.

We're looking for people who play for the love of the game and the community, and we welcome everyone regardless of skill level (these are just kindergarten sports, after all)!<br><br>Not only is meetup kickball cheaper than a league and a little bit less of a long-term commitment (though we won't be surprised if you become a weekly kickballer), this is a much better way to meet other people than joining an official league! In leagues you really only interact with your teammates, but in meetup kickball you switch teams every week, meeting all kinds of new folks! Our games are often played with beer in hand (leading to some impressive plays), and we tend to hit up local pubs for post-game celebrations.<br><br>Anyone and everyone can join - the only thing that we ask is that if your plans change last minute, that you not just bail.

However, many of the workshops here do ask for a registration fee, sometimes $40 or more, to attend that meeting. And that fee is applied with each session you might attend. I certainly understand the desire or need to received compensation, particularly if you are a more advanced photographer, and you are taking the time to help others. I'd personally like to attend these once or twice a month, but those fees add up fast in such cases.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><span>I believe photography is more about a feeling that instills in you after you create something new. I believe shooting is about simply getting outdoors, exploring new towns and scenery, and just practicing the craft.

No costs (other than transportation costs I suppose)<\/b>. With summer approaching, I'd like to explore Boston and the north shore more. I'd like to take day trips and shoot sunrises or sunsets with other photo nerds. Learn from one another. Help one another. We can share tips that we read about online. Share ideas. Share composition styles. And simply shoot together, learning as we go. I do a lot of online research myself and have plenty of beginner tips. I also just came back from two weeks abroad. And I can tell you, that simply shooting every day as I did is the best experience to learn from. I got more comfortable with my camera in two weeks than I have been in year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this group gathers steam, I envision local day trips in the nice weather to Boston and both shore lines. Sunrise photo gatherings. Sunset gatherings. Street photography. Nature photography. When the weather turns cold, we can move indoors to explore Lightroom\/Photoshop together. (every coffee house has wi-fi now). Process images. Maybe do some portrait work indoors on the cold days (serving each other as practice subjects). Learning FLASH photography.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>LET'S TEACH EACH OTHER and HAVE FUN. NO PRESSURE. NO WORKSHOP FEES.

As part of the competition, teams are organized around age-old rivalries \u2014 East vs. West, Blondes vs. Brunettes, City vs. Suburbs \u2014 that inspire fundraising, awareness and action in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.<\/p>\n<p>RivALZ began in the fall of 2005 as Blondes vs. Brunettes\u00ae, a flag football event founded by a group of professional women: Sara Abbott, Andrea Rodgers, Kristyn Noeth, Kate Stukenberg and Meredith Riddle Chastang. The founders of the event have a personal connection to Alzheimer\u2019s and designed the event to drive awareness among a younger audience while raising funds for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Since the inaugural game in Washington, D.C., the event has grown to more than 40 cities, raising more than $5 million and bringing thousands of new supporters to the cause.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, to accommodate nationwide growth, \u201cBlondes vs. Brunettes\u201d grew into \u201cRivALZ,\u201d empowering participants to choose the rivalry around which to organize their teams. The funds raised through RivALZ benefit the care, support and research efforts of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.

About Me: My name is Diego Murillo. I am a Certified Fitness Trainer and Nutrition Specialist, NPC Men's Physique Competitor, Sergeant in the Army served for 6 years, and owner of Mind Body Coaching Zone. About 3 years ago, I was in a completely different place than I am now, both mentally and lifestyle wise. In fact, I never pictured myself doing what I do now. I was working in a 9-6 job that I did not enjoy. Days used to mesh together, because the routine was so monotnous. The only time I did know what day it was, was when the weekend came around. I would go out, party, drink, and basically lose in a couple of hours the training that I put in throughout the whole week. and the FOOD! oh man I would eat whatever was in my face. The \"See Food\" Diet. I felt like I was not striving for goal or a purpose and hit a low point. After finding out that I was going to be deploying, I decided I needed to get control of my life and I needed to figure out what my purpose would be once I Returned home. I decided that I would no longer keep living the lifestyle I had, leading up to that point, working somewhere I was not happy in, having low energy, disliking the person I saw in the mirror and hiding how I truly felt by disguising myself as the \"Fun, party guy\" So during the experience of deployment, I came across my passion and the mission I wanted to achieve once i returned. My passion became fitness and my Mission was to change my life and the lives of those that might currently be going through the same situation that I once did. I wanted to be in the best shape I could be, feel happy with how I looked , and confident that I am working towards something greater. This is why I put this MEET UP group together. To help, inspire, motivate and push men and woman to be the best that they can be! I hope to see you all in the near future! Best, Diego<\/p>","lon":-71.1600036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":201248727,"name":"Diego F.

This is intended to be a safe, open forum free of judgment where professionals can discuss not only their strengths, but their weaknesses and learn from each other to advance our skills - and our careers in today's dynamic and competitive workplace.<\/p>","lon":-71.1600036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":89562872,"name":"Erin","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/1\/highres_250742833.jpeg","photo_id":250742833,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/1\/member_250742833.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/1\/thumb_250742833.jpeg"}},"members":54,"name":"Mid-life Marketeers","id":19867748,"state":"MA","urlname":"Mid-life-Marketeers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":42.6500015259,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461271046000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"spoken-word","name":"Spoken Word","id":15191},{"urlkey":"visual-performing-literary-artists","name":"Visual, Performing, & Literary Artists","id":17298},{"urlkey":"poetic-readings","name":"Poetic Readings","id":20335},{"urlkey":"poetry-writing","name":"Poetry Writing","id":22655},{"urlkey":"open-mic","name":"Open Mic","id":26103},{"urlkey":"poetry-workshop","name":"Poetry Workshop","id":28494},{"urlkey":"prose-and-poetry","name":"Prose and Poetry","id":28832},{"urlkey":"slammers-people-who-like-to-perform-their-poetry","name":"Slammers: People Who Like To Perform Their Poetry","id":28833},{"urlkey":"poetry-readings","name":"Poetry Readings","id":44304},{"urlkey":"short-stories","name":"Short Stories","id":62138},{"urlkey":"non-fiction-storytelling-spin-a-true-tale","name":"Non-Fiction Storytelling: Spin a True Tale","id":110794}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/iScribe-Boston\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Are you ready to be a part of an inclusive community of individuals who dare to write poetry? iScribe is a new Boston poetic movement that is designed as an outlet for writers and creators from pluralistic backgrounds. iScribe intends to bring together beginner to advanced poets together in a unique manner by creating opportunities for collaboration, performances, open mic specials, and much much more.<br>Why is this unique?<br>At iScribe all participants have an opportunity to share their talent without judgement.

Because of costs for safe (as in private) space rentals where people feel ok sharing, materials, prep time etc there are small ticket costs for events. If anyone has a strong need for this group and can't manage the cost please contact me privately. Ultimately the goal is to help each other feel cared for. Per suggestions we may do some outreach to people who are lonely or free things in the future if we get offerings in terms of free venues etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meetup is comprised of sharing and some hugging. &nbsp;Hugging is therapeutic as a way of building human connection, warming our hearts, strengthening our health and reducing stress. This group is for anyone that wants to connect with others in a strictly platonic, safe, supportive environment. The goal it to give and receive joy and caring in a non sexual way. We all need human touch and for one reason or another may not be getting it in our personal lives. Let's come together and get back to who we were meant to be as humans; connected, supported, heart focused.<\/p>\n<p>People's consent is completely supported. saying \"NO\" when you feel like it will be encouraged as both an exercise and a reality. There will also be support for feelings that come up about that. This will be a supportive environment for both participation and none participation for any of the exercises\/activities in an event. My mission is to create a emotionally safe, heartwarming, spirit building experience for all.<\/p>\n<p>My hope is the bigger our community gets the more we can build a movement so that people in general feel more, seen, heard, cared for.

<br>If you are seeking a full day to re-connect with the voice and heart behind your written words, then join us in this oceanside retreat. <br>Each writers journey is their spiritual gift and this retreat will honor that. <br>In addition to morning writing prompts you will have time after lunch to walk the beach or follow the shore road to the harbor entrance. <br>In the afternoon you can join in more group writing and share a piece of your work or not. <br>This retreat is not intended to critique your work or your style. <br>It is also not therapy. <br>Journal writing by nature can be a wonderful door to leading a more mindful life and the path that the prompts lead you down will be supported and encouraged. <br>Hopefully you will leave with a greater sense of openness to all that gives you a chance to pause and observe. <br>Sometimes giving yourself the time and space away from your routine and obligations is all that's needed to find your writing voice. <br>As a writer and facilitator I will happily open my home once again to women writers who come with blank pages and leave with a deeper sense of their self. <br>Light breakfast food and lunch will be provided. <br>Arrival is between 8:30 and 9, starting with our sharing of intentions at 9. <br>Writing will be guided by prompts between 9:30 and 12. You can choose to write on the porch, deck or in one of the comfortable living spaces . After writing we will have an opportunity to share if desired. <br>We break from 12-1:30. <br>The beach and harbor are just outside the door. It's a perfect spot to simply let everything slip away and breathe. <br>Writing back at the house resumes promptly at 1:30. <br>Each writer has another opportunity to share a writing piece. <br>Goodbyes are said at 4:00<\/p>","lon":-70.75,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/6\/c\/e\/highres_449469934.jpeg","photo_id":449469934,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/6\/c\/e\/600_449469934.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/6\/c\/e\/thumb_449469934.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":154779342,"name":"Deb McNabb","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/b\/6\/highres_209003222.jpeg","photo_id":209003222,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/b\/6\/member_209003222.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/a\/b\/6\/thumb_209003222.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"Scituate Journal Writers","id":19890698,"state":"MA","urlname":"SJWonretreat","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":42.2000007629,"who":"Scituate Journal  Writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461815247000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"steppers","name":"Steppers","id":8715},{"urlkey":"dance-lessons","name":"Dance Lessons","id":19146},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"urban-ballroom","name":"Urban Ballroom","id":24904},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dancing-basics","name":"Ballroom Dancing Basics","id":44931},{"urlkey":"chicago-stepping","name":"Chicago Stepping","id":55418},{"urlkey":"social-dancing-ballroom-and-latin-beginner-class","name":"Social Dancing Ballroom and Latin Beginner Class","id":61660},{"urlkey":"learn-ballroom-dancing","name":"Learn Ballroom Dancing","id":63874},{"urlkey":"chicago-style-steppers","name":"Chicago Style Steppers","id":89902},{"urlkey":"ballroom-dancing-lessons","name":"Ballroom Dancing Lessons","id":112279},{"urlkey":"dancing-chicago-style-stepping","name":"Dancing Chicago Style Stepping","id":121173},{"urlkey":"chicago-steppin","name":"Chicago Steppin","id":796612}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dance-Tank-United\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>'Dance well at the Dance Tank.' <br><\/p>\n<p>Here at Dance Tank United we learn a variety of different dance forms.&nbsp;

Bravo to you all! I, too, will be forcing one foot in front of the other in an attempt to cross the finish line with my pride intact. That being what it is, I'm inviting you all to join me one day in advance, on May 21 at 1:00, to The First Annual BarKrawl to Benefit Last Hope K9 Rescue in Davis Sq. We will start with brunch, meet at Orleans to don our t-shirts and gracefully stumble about in direct alcoholic service to LHK9. (Orleans, Joshua Tree, Burren, Sligo, 5 Horses) Many of you could be the kind of dog rescuer\/dog lover\/single (wo)man ready to mingle who also eschews alcohol-don't fret-we need you too. You can sign up, get a t-shirt, and support the drunken adventures of your fellow rescuers and newly made friends. Responsibilities include ensuring no one drives, we all get into a real Uber, holding hair back for those under 25 y\/o rookies who inevitably vomit on a side street, and pointing the herd toward the next destination. Sadly, this is not a dog friendly event. Leave those buzzkills at home. No one appreciates them licking themselves in public and judging us on our alcohol intake. So. Who's in? (P.S. Bring your friends. Bring people you don't like. I don't care, we just want their money and to have a fun time.) I'm marketing this as a singles event, because the local single male population seems to have NO idea that dog rescue is THE place to meet kind, hard-working, dog-loving local hotties. Agree to foster a dog and well, I'm not responsible for the awesomeness that might take place after that.

Boston's Premiere: Out Of Darkness Film &amp; Live Discussion w\/ Radio personality, Truth teller, Historian, Hiphop aficionado SABIR BEY! Out Of Darkness is an educational revolution! The film is one that should be seen by every person here in America, not just Black people. It is a must-see for its educational qualities, its unbowed stance against racism, and unapologetic manner of speaking truth to power. The film will examine the untold history of African people, the African cultural contribution to the nation of the world, and the events that have contributed to the condition of African people today. Viewers will learn about the Nubian\/Kushitic origins of Nile Valley Civilization, contact between Africa and the Americas since the times of antiquity, as well as the influence of the Moors in Europe leading to Europe\u2019s intellectual Renaissance. In addition, the film will analyze the history of modern day racism, the idea of nationhood, and contextualize the impact of Hip Hop as a social movement--charging that modern, commercial Hip Hop was co-opted and now serves largely as a means to oppress people, while also doing an excellent job at re-connecting Hip Hop to the griots, truth tellers, and artists before them. Out Of Darkness comes with a powerful and influential cast, narrated by Prof. Kaba Kamene, and co-stars Sabir Bey, Dr. Umar Johnson, Dr. Claud Anderson, Tim Wise, Prof. James Small, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Anthony Browder, Atlantis Browder, and Taj Tarik Bey. This special screening will be directly followed by a thought-provoking and deep discussion and Q&amp;A with film speaker Sabir Bey!","lon":-71.0500030518,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":98072412,"name":"Jazz Hippie Monk","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/d\/e\/highres_256426302.jpeg","photo_id":256426302,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/d\/e\/member_256426302.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/4\/d\/e\/thumb_256426302.jpeg"}},"members":26,"name":"Boston Premiere: Out Of Darkness Meetup","id":19938250,"state":"MA","urlname":"Boston-Premiere-Out-Of-Darkness-Meetup","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Illuminated Ones"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462926387000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"mompreneurs","name":"Mompreneurs","id":23247},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905},{"urlkey":"momexchange","name":"MomExchange","id":146496}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FoundingMoms-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Entrepreneurial moms meet and network with each other.

This group is all about making new friends, having great conversations together, sharing fun and casual social experiences, and connecting with people we share things in common with. &nbsp;It isn't about building business connections or networking as some of us may even be retired. &nbsp;This group will meet twice a month to enjoy relaxed times together, go on day outings, have cook-outs, or game nights together, all in a stress free, drama casual location that helps us to build lasting friendships. The group will decide on future events and activities together as we grow and expand our membership. I look forward to meeting you soon at our first meet-up which will take place in the Boston area. &nbsp;Spouses are also welcomed, as well as those who have attended the Sister Schools and other highly rated universities. &nbsp;We will meet every other week for fun, good conversation, playing games together and just getting to know each other. We can meet at at a member's house, a public park, local restaurants or make plans to do other activities. The group will decide what we do.

Carter<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;It provides an increased G-force (gravitational load), which strengthens the musculoskeletal systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. &nbsp;It protects the joints from the chronic fatigue delivered by exercising on hard surfaces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. &nbsp;It helps manage body composition and improves muscle-to-fat ratio.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;It increases capacity for respiration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. &nbsp;It circulates more oxygen to the tissues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. &nbsp;It establishes a better equilibrium between the oxygen required by the tissues and the oxygen made available.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>7. &nbsp;It aids lymphatic circulation by stimulating the millions of one-way valves in the lymphatic system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>8. &nbsp;It tends to reduce the height to which the arterial pressures rise during exertion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>9. &nbsp;It lessens the time during which blood pressure remains abnormal after severe activity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>10. &nbsp;It assists in the rehabilitation of a heart problem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>11. &nbsp;It increases the functional activity of the red bone marrow in the production of red blood cells.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>12. &nbsp;It improves resting metabolic rate so that more calories are burned for hours after exercise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>13. &nbsp;It causes muscles to perform work in moving fluids through the body to lighten the heart's load.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>14. &nbsp;It decreases the volume of blood pooling in the veins of the cardiovascular system preventing chronic edema.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>15. &nbsp;It encourages collateral circulation by increasing the capillary count in the muscles and decreasing the distance between the capillaries and the target cells.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>16. &nbsp;It strengthens the heart and other muscles in the body so that they work more efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>17. &nbsp;It allows the resting heart to beat less often.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>18. &nbsp;It lowers circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>19. &nbsp;It lowers low-density lipoprotein (bad) and increases high-density lipoprotein (good) within the blood holding off the incidence of coronary artery disease.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>20. &nbsp;It promotes tissue repair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>21. &nbsp;It increases the mitochondria count within the muscle cells, essential for endurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>22. &nbsp;It adds to the alkaline reserve of the body, which may be of significance in an emergency requiring prolonged effort.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>23. &nbsp;It improves coordination between the propreoceptors in the joints, the transmission of nerve impulses to and from the brain, transmission of nerve impulses and responsiveness of the muscle fibers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>24. &nbsp;It improves the brain's responsiveness to the vestibular apparatus within the inner ear, thus improving balance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>25. &nbsp;It offers relief from neck and back pains, headaches, and other pain caused by lack of exercise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>26. &nbsp;It enhances digestion and elimination processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>27. &nbsp;It allows for deeper and easier relaxation and sleep.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>28. &nbsp;It results in better mental performance, with keener learning processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>29. &nbsp;It curtails fatigue and menstrual discomfort for women.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>30. &nbsp;It minimizes the number of colds, allergies, digestive disturbances, and abdominal problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>31. &nbsp;It tends to slow down atrophy in the aging process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>32. &nbsp;It is an effective modality by which the user gains a sense of control and an improved self-image.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>33. &nbsp;It is enjoyable!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><i>For more information about the 33 Benefits, refer to the following books:&nbsp;<\/i><\/b> <br><i>- &nbsp;Jumping for Health by Dr. Morton Walker - Avery Publishing, Garden City Park, New York&nbsp;

Imagine not having these activities available as a child. Today, many local children do not have a safe environment to play. This letter will help you understand how you can join us in making a difference in the lives of at-risk youth. The WorldVentures Foundation, in partnership with phenomenal Coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman, created the DreamCourts\u2122 program to serve children. With the support of local individuals and businesses, we have built high-quality basketball courts throughout the United States at Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. This initiative makes a difference in the lives of your local children, inspiring communities to promote joy and support local youth. DreamCourts are a multi-sport play space designed to promote physical fitness and fun. The goal of the program is to help keep children off the streets and to provide them with a safe and competitive environment where they can develop skills, such as teamwork and good sportsmanship.

These topics are by no means exclusive, and we are interested in meeting anyone who has an interest in the occult. Should you be a seasoned Hermetic Practitioner, or follower of Thelema, we would be incredibly excited to meet you and learn along side you.

All ages, free admission, serving beer, wine and our full menu. Gift certificates will be awarded to the top two teams. Note: Gift certificates will not be reedeamable on the night they are awarded. Founded in 1999 outside of Boston MA, Stump! Trivia Quiz is a live hosted knowledge based event played in bars and restaurants all over the country. We currently conduct approximately 400 events a week, providing fun and exciting competitions in bars, restaurants and special events. Get your team, (up to 6 max) to one of our venues to test your skill at an assortment of trivia questions, from Anatomy to Literature, Movies to History, Sports to Science. Other trivia companies, players, bar owners always ask: What has made Stump! Trivia so successful since 1999? The Format, the Hosts and the Questions. 1) FORMAT\u2026Our unique format makes the game more exciting than most. We combine the strategy of wagering points, with the need for cleverness for our bonus rounds.This is not just 50, 60, or 70 questions asked in a row and whoever has the highest score wins. Stump! involves strategy, which helps keep new teams winning each week. 2) HOSTS\u2026Our staff of professionally trained hosts. These are not Dj\u2019s, but people that love trivia, love running trivia events. They realize that Stump! is the entertainment and their job is to complement it. Being able to keep the pace of the game, recruit first time teams, or help someone with the clarity of a question, these men and women know what they are doing. Over 50% of our hosts have been with Stump for 5+ years, 25% 10+ years. Our hosts run the spectrum of jobs, from Teachers, lawyers, bio-chemists, fishermen, private eyes, and even a couple cool Accountants. Our hosts help seperate Stump! from the rest of the field. Check out what some of our hosts do on their biopage. 3) QUESTIONS\u2026 Since our founding in 1999, our focus has been on the question writing. In order to gain any respect from trivia players, the content needs to be 100% correct. You can have the best format, the best hosts, but if the questions you ask are wrong, you are in the WRONG business. How long would you be in the restaurant business if your food is awful. Although we get ideas from people all across the country, we create all original content. As far as we know there has not been a wrong question since August 8th 2012, and this was the question. (BTW, It wasn\u2019t wrong, it just had a second answer that we didn\u2019t realize). In Mythology, what famous creature was the offspring of Poseiden and the snake-haired Medusa, born from her neck when Perseus beheaded her? 1) Pegasus (The \u201cFamous\u201d winged Horse that most people have heard of, that was our answer.) And the answer that one team brought up 2) Chrysaor was a son of the Gorgon Medusa. He was usually represented as giant, but may also have been conceived of as a winged boar, just as his twin brother Pegasus was a winged horse. .","lon":-71.1699981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/d\/highres_450120301.jpeg","photo_id":450120301,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/d\/600_450120301.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/d\/thumb_450120301.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":76573712,"name":"Raymond Brady","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/5\/9\/highres_256640057.jpeg","photo_id":256640057,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/5\/9\/member_256640057.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/5\/9\/thumb_256640057.jpeg"}},"members":13,"name":"Stump Team Trivia at Dedham Square Coffeehouse","id":19966075,"state":"MA","urlname":"Stump-Team-Trivia-at-Dedham-Square-Coffeehouse","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":42.2400016785,"who":"The Staves"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Salem","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1463539761000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"healing","name":"Healing","id":16151},{"urlkey":"reiki-classes","name":"Reiki Classes","id":18883},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Healing-Creative-Salem\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Healing Creative is a collaborative of holistic practitioners united with a common goal of providing a variety of creative healing arts to promote well-being, self-empowerment, and healthy living.<\/p>","lon":-70.9000015259,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/c\/8\/highres_450282696.jpeg","photo_id":450282696,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/c\/8\/600_450282696.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/6\/c\/8\/thumb_450282696.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":205349618,"name":"Michelle Foss-Zampino","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/9\/7\/highres_256632183.jpeg","photo_id":256632183,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/9\/7\/member_256632183.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/9\/7\/thumb_256632183.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Healing Creative - Salem","id":19966383,"state":"MA","urlname":"Healing-Creative-Salem","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Healing Creators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1463580285000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"data-center-and-operations-automation","name":"Data Center and Operations Automation","id":46831},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"devops","name":"DevOps","id":87614},{"urlkey":"continuous-delivery","name":"Continuous Delivery","id":166000},{"urlkey":"devops-automation","name":"DevOps Automation","id":1508781}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Spinnaker-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Are you a developer, platform engineer, infrastructure engineer or release engineer interested in continuous deployment?

All Dads with infants are welcome whether you are young, old, working, AHD (at home dad), blue collar or white collar, etc. I also look forward to feedback and ideas to make this group fun, informative and perhaps meet new friends for ourselves and our kids.<\/p>","lon":-70.75,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9401594,"name":"Chris","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/d\/e\/highres_256839134.jpeg","photo_id":256839134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/d\/e\/member_256839134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/8\/d\/e\/thumb_256839134.jpeg"}},"members":8,"name":"South Shore (new) Dads","id":19971987,"state":"MA","urlname":"South-Shore-new-Dads","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.2000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brookline","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1463671405000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"republican","name":"Republican Party","id":95},{"urlkey":"conservative","name":"Conservatives","id":1670},{"urlkey":"politics","name":"Politics","id":4377},{"urlkey":"elections","name":"Elections","id":40198},{"urlkey":"national-politics","name":"National Politics","id":112476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brookline-Republican-Party-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Republicans... to discuss coming national election.<\/p>","lon":-71.1299972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":184272370,"name":"phyllis tannenbaum","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/a\/1\/highres_243641121.jpeg","photo_id":243641121,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/a\/1\/member_243641121.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/0\/a\/1\/thumb_243641121.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"Republican Party Meetup 50+","id":19972030,"state":"MA","urlname":"Brookline-Republican-Party-Meetup","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":42.3300018311,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Waltham","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1463695335000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"socializing-for-40","name":"Socializing for 40+","id":16181},{"urlkey":"40s-and-50s-social-community","name":"40s and 50s Social Community","id":82340}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Alternative-Singles\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We'll hang out and socialize.Have some gatherings at a cool artist loft in Waltham. <br>We'll have some singles events.

No previous experience needed!<\/p>\n<p>More info here: <a href=\"https:\/\/registration.xenegrade.com\/nce\/coursedisplay.cfm?schID=8277&amp;CFID=2739807&amp;CFTOKEN=25a42d9091a25e07-B2A8C1B3-155D-1D81-0D074BBD8E107E35\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/registration.xenegrade.com\/nce\/coursedisplay.cfm?schID=8277&amp;CFID=2739807&amp;CFTOKEN=25a42d9091a25e07-B2A8C1B3-155D-1D81-0D074BBD8E107E35<\/a><\/p>","lon":-71.1900024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/6\/a\/highres_450334410.jpeg","photo_id":450334410,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/6\/a\/600_450334410.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/6\/a\/thumb_450334410.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183350545,"name":"Carla Mulet","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/2\/d\/highres_256804909.jpeg","photo_id":256804909,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/2\/d\/member_256804909.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/2\/d\/thumb_256804909.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Newton Flamenco Meetup","id":19986913,"state":"MA","urlname":"Newton-Flamenco-Meetup","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1464028041000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"twenty-somethings","name":"Twenty-Somethings","id":15531},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"young-adults","name":"Young Adults","id":17649},{"urlkey":"20s-social","name":"20's Social","id":17925},{"urlkey":"20s-and-30s","name":"20's and 30's","id":29541},{"urlkey":"20-somethings","name":"20 somethings","id":50188}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cambridge-20s-30s-Social-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Are you 18-35 and trying to figure out what you want out of life?

As we want to be inclusive to everyone there should be a balance of day, night and weekend activities.\"&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-71.3499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":205834737,"name":"Natick Moms Meet-Up","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/f\/highres_256860799.jpeg","photo_id":256860799,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/f\/member_256860799.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/1\/f\/thumb_256860799.jpeg"}},"members":48,"name":"Natick Moms Meetup","id":19994783,"state":"MA","urlname":"Natick-Moms-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Moms on the GO"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Burlington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1464196621000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"paas","name":"PaaS (Platform as a Service)","id":31197},{"urlkey":"microsoft-azure","name":"Microsoft Azure","id":63265},{"urlkey":"iaas-infrastructure-as-a-service","name":"IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)","id":107633},{"urlkey":"sql-azure","name":"SQL Azure","id":961682},{"urlkey":"azure","name":"Azure","id":1137362}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Boston-Azure-Cloud-User-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"We are a community-run user group with the goal of learning about cloud computing with the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform.","lon":-71.1999969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1354189,"name":"Jason Haley","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/8\/b\/highres_8671371.jpeg","photo_id":8671371,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/8\/b\/member_8671371.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/8\/b\/thumb_8671371.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"North Boston Azure Cloud User Group","id":19995550,"state":"MA","urlname":"North-Boston-Azure-Cloud-User-Group","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":42.5099983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1464200381000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"information-management","name":"Information Management","id":26909},{"urlkey":"software-modeling","name":"Software Modeling","id":164220},{"urlkey":"spreadsheets","name":"Spreadsheets","id":332211},{"urlkey":"financial-modeling","name":"Financial Modeling","id":391491},{"urlkey":"data","name":"Data","id":480642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Quantrix-Spreadsheets-Meetup-Boston\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all local users of the Quantrix Modeling software and those who are looking for an alternative to traditional spreadsheets such as Excel.

We hold one another accountable for attaining the goals we set during our initial firewalk! &nbsp;We'll continue to meet--on a voluntary basis--to check in with one another after our Firewalk on June 25.<\/p>\n<p>Firewalking promises to propel you past your obstacles, help you overcome self-limiting beliefs and negative patterns. &nbsp;An ancient art once reserved for shamans and mystics, this practice is now available so everyone may benefit from its extreme transformational power. &nbsp;Through a variety of activities, you'll learn to identify the self-limiting beliefs holding you back from the life you envision. Faced with the powerful metaphor of walking across hot coals, you'll learn how to recognize fear and step past it into the way you'd like to be instead. For some, Firewalking is a deeply spiritual experience. For others, it is a motivational process unlike any other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Requirements for participation: &nbsp;You must be 18 years old or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian who is participating and who will sign for you. &nbsp;Please, no drugs or alcohol prior to or at the event as you'll need to pay 100% attention to do this! &nbsp;We recommend wearing light colored, weather appropriate clothing with shoes that are easy to slip in and out of. &nbsp;While we hope you will choose to firewalk, it is never required of you and your choice NOT to walk will be completely respected. For some, choosing not to walk is as empowering as walking! &nbsp; <br>We encourage you to have your dinner meal prior to the event. We'll provide water and some light snacks (granola bars, nuts, fruit) for quick nutrition. <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>Join the thousands of people who've earned the right to call themselves Firewalkers! &nbsp;One you walk on fire, you'll be certain you can do anything you set your mind to! &nbsp;We look forward to meeting you at Firewalk Boston and following through with you in the Firewalking tribe!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/c\/d\/highres_450576813.jpeg","photo_id":450576813,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/c\/d\/600_450576813.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/c\/d\/thumb_450576813.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":206152668,"name":"Karina B.
