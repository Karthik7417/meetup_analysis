Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

This free mass attunement is also actually given as our social service for those who cannot afford Reiki workshop fee but are willing to use Reiki channeling ability to help him\/herself and others.<\/p> <p>You do not need to register in advance to receive this mass attunement, just be ready during the schedule of 6.30pm local time. More details on this below.<\/p> <p>Please understand that this free attunement is not Reiki Tummo attunement, it is Usui Reiki Level 1 attunement. In term of the attunement results, it is not the same as Reiki Tummo attunement because the Usui Reiki attunements will only open upper half of your main energy channel\/sushumna (from crown chakra to heart chakra) while Reiki Tummo attunements will open the whole sushumna from crown chakra up to base chakra. However, this free Usui Reiki Level 1 attunement is given remotely by Mr. Irmansyah Effendi by means of Reiki Tummo attunement techniques, so the result is somehow better than traditional Usui Reiki attunement results.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For more detail information about the difference between Usui Reiki and Reiki Tummo attunement results, please use your yahoo email address to sign in to this group web page (<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\"><a href=\"http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/mygroups<\/a><\/a>) and then visit the file section of this group or click:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/health.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Kundalini_Reiki\/files\/DRAWINGS_PHOTOS_ILLUSTRATIONS\/<\/a><\/a> and the file name is: AttunementComparisonUsuiReikiTummo.gif<br\/>You are welcome to explore and study other drawings there and put questions on this list.<\/p> <p>For more detail information about Reiki Tummo You can also buy Reiki Tummo book (\"REIKI TUMMO: An Effective Technique For Health and Happiness\" is written by the founder and Grandmaster of Reiki Tummo, Irmansyah Effendi, MSc.) at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/\">www.amazon.com<\/a> (ISBN:[masked])<\/p> <p>Since it is given by means of Reiki Tummo attunement technique, the result is very good for cleansing your crown chakra, heart chakra as well as palm chakras and energy channels. All alumni of Reiki Tummo workshops from Padmacahaya or Padmajaya are entitled to join and receive this free mass attunement as Reiki Tummo attunement (because you already received one before).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please read the instruction below on DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION. Also since the main benefit of the attunement is to help your heart get better connection to Divine Love and Light so your heart can be opened and cleansed better by Divine Love and Light then we suggest you to also do OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION daily before and after the attunement. Please read more information below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>May you enjoy and get benefit from this mass attunement.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Much Love and Light for your beautiful hearts, :)\u00a0<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>DISTANT ATTUNEMENT PREPARATION<br\/>Note: No need to register in advance, just be ready during the attunement.<\/p> <p>WHAT TO DO FOR A DISTANT ATTUNEMENT<\/p> <p>1. You do not need to register to receive this free mass attunement of Usui Reiki Level 1. Just prepare your self at the day of the attunement (1st of each month)\u00a0<br\/>2. No need to adjust your local time any longer. The attunement has been programmed to be received every 1st of each month at 6.30 PM YOUR OWN LOCAL TIME, where ever you are, for 15 minutes duration.\u00a0<br\/>3. Please study how to do Self Healing\/Treatment with Reiki. You can find this in some web pages or in some Reiki books. You do need to do self healing right away after the attunement is finished to make good use of the attunement energy flow that is still working on you even though the attunement is over already. Please see Note below for suggested hand positions during self healing.\u00a0<br\/>4. On the attunement day, try to get a room where you will not be disturbed. The attunement will take about 15 minutes. It is best to have a room in which the light is not too bright. If possible, have new age music and incense or aroma therapy ready. Dim light and music will help you to get relaxed easily. The incense or aroma therapy will be needed to neutralize the negative energy that will come out of you during the attunement. Remember the attunement is also a cleansing process.\u00a0<br\/>5. About 30 minutes before the attunement, it is good to start doing simple and light exercises that move most parts of your body, but don't make yourself exhausted. Simply do exercise for about 30-60 seconds for each part of the body. This will help energy flow even better in your physical body layer.\u00a0<br\/>6. Since the attunement will help opening your heart connection to Divine energy, then for better result, we suggest you to do Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation after doing simple exercises. That can be done about 15 minutes before the attunement. Please read more information on Open Heart Prayer\/Meditation below.\u00a0<br\/>7. After the simple exercises and Open Heart Prayer, get relaxed, dim the light, and turn the music on. Light incense before the attunement starts. Sit on a chair; try to keep your spine straight without forcing it. Make sure that your legs are not crossed and it is better if both feet are grounded. Put both of your hands on your thighs with your palms facing upwards. Please don't fall asleep during the attunement! :)\u00a0<br\/>8. During the attunement, simply relax. Do not make any effort to concentrate. Do not practice any breathing technique. Try to be as still as possible and enjoy whatever happens. It is a good practice to always relaxed, smile at your heart and surrender to Divine Source of Love and Light during the attunement. Also be willing to open your heart to Divine Source to receive more Divine Love and Light during the attunement. It is all done by intention only and then relaxed, smile and enjoy the attunement process. DO NOT EXPECT anything to happen since this will make you are not relaxed anymore :)\u00a0<br\/>9. After the attunement, do a complete self-healing directly. Take your time and do it properly and enjoy with smile and happy feeling from your heart all the time.\u00a0<br\/>10. After self-healing, try to do the same simple exercises you did before the attunement to help your physical body absorb Reiki energy better.<br\/>11. Keep on doing self healing for at least 21 days. It is best to do it every day even after you pass the 21-days period to maintain your health and improve your energy. Also, since the main benefit of channeling Reiki energy is to open and cleanse our heart, then it is always better to do Open Heart Prayer also every day to cleanse and keep our heart open better for Divine Love and Light.<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0<br\/>1) Suggested hand positions for channeling Reiki energy during Self Healing are (3 minutes per position sequentially):\u00a0<br\/>FRONT OF THE BODY: Forehead\/face, Cheeks, Throat, Upper chest, Lower chest, Stomach, Thighs, Knees, and Ankles<br\/>BACK OF THE BODY: Back of the head, Nape of the neck, Upper back, Lower back\/waist, Buttocks, Back of thighs, Calves and Soles of the feet\u00a0<br\/>2) More detail and complete techniques about doing healing and other Reiki techniques will be taught in Reiki Tummo workshops. Visit www.padmacahaya.com or www.padmacahaya.org for more information.<br\/>3) Please feel free to share your experiences after the attunement and doing Self Healing for 21 days and Open Heart Meditation every day.<\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br\/>OPEN HEART PRAYER\/MEDITATION<br\/>(By Irmansyah Effendi)<\/p> <p>Each time we have negative emotion, we leave \/ deposit negativities within our heart. How many time a day we have negative emotions, even though we do not show them. To cleanse the heart further (bigger and deeper), the best way is to ask for blessing from the True Source of Love and Light.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Before you start this prayer, you may need to write down the name of the people you don't like (you need to forgive), and for what you need to ask for forgiveness. You can replace the terminology \u201cTrue Source\u201d with any other terminology which you are more comfortable with \/ can relate better to.<\/p> <p>STEPS:<br\/>(Follow your feeling while praying)<br\/>1. Touch your heart (center of your chest) with 1 or 2 fingers<br\/>2. Close your eyes<br\/>3. Relax<br\/>4. Smile<br\/>5. Smile to your heart sweetly and freely<br\/>6. Feel the nice feeling from your heart, smile and stay within that nice feeling along the prayer<br\/>7. Pray (from the heart with feeling and love):\u00a0<br\/>1) True Source, please bless our heart so that all arrogance be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>2) True Source, please bless our heart so that all selfishness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>3) True Source, please bless our heart so that all anger be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>4) True Source, please bless our heart so that all envy and jealousy be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>5) True Source, please bless our heart so that all greediness and cunningness be removed, to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>6) True Source, please bless our heart to understand that peace, calmness and joy are better than negative emotions. We have to let go of all negative emotions toward others, so that You can bless our heart, to fill our heart with Your Love and Light, peace, calmness and joy. Please bless and help us to be able to forgive everyone sincerely.<br\/>{Now, forgive everyone sincerely, although the same person has been doing the same negative things repeatedly and is still doing it. Remember that keeping negative emotion in you will simply give you pressure and burdens.}<br\/>7) True Source, as we have forgiven everyone else, please bless our heart so that all hatred, sadness, resentment, disappointment and other negative emotions, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>8) True Source, please bless and help us to realize that You are All Loving and All Forgiving. Please bless and help us to realize all of our mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.\u00a0<br\/>{Now, realize all of your mistakes, be remorseful, and ask for forgiveness.}<br\/>9) True Source, as You have forgiven all of our mistakes, please bless our heart and whole being so that all fear, worry, and burdens because of those mistakes, be removed to be replaced with Your Love and Light.<br\/>10) True Source, please bless and help us to be able to stay within our heart, within Your Love and Light, to always be peaceful, calm, and joyful.<br\/>11) True Source, thank You for all of Your blessing, Love and Light.<br\/>12) Amen.<\/p> <p>Note:<br\/>a. Since the most important benefit of Reiki attunement for our heart is to open and connecting our heart better to Divine Love and Light to cleanse our heart further, so for better results of Reiki attunement on your self and heart, it is suggested to do this Open Heart Prayer prior to receiving the attunement (say starting 2 weeks daily before the attunement) and every day after the attunement.\u00a0<br\/>b. The Open Heart Prayer CD in English or Indonesian language is available for purchase.\u00a0<br\/>c. More techniques and practice on opening and activating your heart can be learnt through Open Heart Workshop from Padmacahaya.

Brahms\u2019 emotional German Requiem is uniquely paired with J.S. Bach\u2019s Cantata BWV 60, \u201cO Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort\u201d and Ricercar, and Anton Webern\u2019s Five Movements for String Orchestra. Webern\u2019s refracted take on Bach, and one of Bach\u2019s most emotionally affecting cantatas beautifully paves the way for Brahms\u2019 radiant music. Soloists include local favorites Majie Zeller, soprano, Lynn Torgove, alto, Eric Christopher Perry, tenor, Mark Andrew Cleveland, bass, and Dana Whiteside, bass. John Harbison, composer and former Cantata Singers\u2019\u00a0<\/p> <p>Music Director, will give the pre-concert talk, free to all ticketholders, at 7pm in Williams Hall.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Following the performance, all are welcome at a free post-concert reception in Williams Hall.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Meetup Members are entitled to a 20% ticket discount at any level with the promo code \"Meetup 1516\" when purchasing tickets at <a href=\"https:\/\/cantatasingers.secure.force.com\/ticket\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/cantatasingers.secure.force.com\/ticket<\/a>\u00ad Hope you all can join us!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Choral-Music-Meetup\/events\/229958829\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Cantata Singers: Brahm's A German Requiem,  (ticket offer, not a meetup)","id":"229958829","time":1459555200000,"updated":1459567901000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1445611660000,"name":"Boston Choral Music Meetup","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19054082,"urlname":"Boston-Choral-Music-Meetup","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Choral music lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01801","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Woburn","address_1":"15 Middlesex Canal Park ","address_2":"HOLIDAY INN SELECT WOBURN","lon":-71.158722,"phone":"781-897-4000","name":"Scoreboard Sports Bar and Grill ","id":1173954,"state":"MA","lat":42.497452,"repinned":false},"headcount":29,"distance":10.5412454605,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459350041000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dance to \"Don't Call me Shirkey\", Friday Apl. 1st. 8 pm.

Today, have an interesting event which I hope will catch your attention!<\/p> <p>Comicazi, one of our primary venues, is expanding! They have taken over space adjacent to their location, and will soon be working towards integrating it into their current floor. In the meantime, they are using that space to feature a Yard Sale Event. Ten tables will be available for people who are looking to clear out their collections to make room for newer material.<\/p> <p><b>Why is this going up as an event? Because our group has reserved a table!<br\/><\/b><br\/>If you have stuff you would like to get rid of, especially after the dealers room of Anime Boston, we are offering two options.<\/p> <p><b>First<\/b>, if you would like to participate as a vendor, you may come, sell your wares, and pay part of the table rental fee ($15 per table divided by the number of vendors). You would then keep any resulting funds, but would be responsible for both managing your things and removing them after the sale ends.<\/p> <p><b>Second<\/b>, if you would just like to clear out your shelves or media collections, you can arrange to drop off those materials to the group, and any funds raised, minus the table rental fee, would be donated to the group, and any leftover items would be used as a part of the raffle later that night during our Patema Inverted Viewing.<\/p> <p>If either of these interests you, please message me directly for details and guidelines. Space is limited, and while we can try to grab a second table, they do tend to go very quickly. <b>So time is of the essence. <\/b><\/p> <p>Now, this event is open to anyone in Davis Square, not just our membership. In addition, it will be inside, so weather will not be a problem. So, this is a great opportunity to get a lot of exposure and clear out some space at the same time.

It will also be held at Boston Winery before the SUP SONAS Client Appreciation Wine Tasting &amp; Pizza Party. It is for beginner surfers, stand up paddlesurfers or stand-up paddleboarders who are venturing out into the ocean. I am a stand up paddleboard and sup surf instructor and competitor in greater Boston, New England and Costa Rica and am based on the South Shore in Massachusetts. It will help you learn about how to pick and choose which waves are best, what types of waves there are, surf etiquette and how to behave in a line-up, how to safety maneuver your board so as not to hurt yourself, other surfers, other swimmers or your board, how to read online surf reports and more about ocean safety for surfing and stand up paddleboarding. It is a course great for anyone who will be venturing out into the waves on purpose or by accident :). I will also answer any other questions on board selection, how to get into the competitive circuit and what wetsuit to buy for the spring. Come mingle with other stand up paddleboarders and surfers. $5 to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will also have the following courses available at different times, so let me know if interested:<\/p> <p>\"Learn how to Stand Up Paddleboard.

How much is this extra-ordinary view like what others call 'Spirituality'? This empirically-based perspective can speak to our desires for truth, transcendence, and meaning.

The grape Sangiovese is king in Tuscany. Sangiovese has different clones that make Chianti Classico, Vino Nobile di Montalepulciano and Brunello di Montalcino.<\/p> <p>In the 1970s a new class of wines known in the trade as Super Tuscans emerged. These wines were made outside DOC\/DOCG regulations but were considered of high quality and commanded high prices. Many of these wines became cult wines.<\/p> <p>Some people define Super Tuscan wine as a Tuscan blend made with Cabernet Sauvignon or other international varieties. Others define it as any expensive wine from Tuscany.<\/p> <p>The truth is the Super Tuscan is all those things\u2014and none of those things. A Super Tuscan can be a 100 percent expression of Sangiovese with absolutely no international varieties. It can be a DOC wine, and in fact many are, and it can span any price point from $12 to $275.<\/p> <p>Our tour will bring us to three regions of Tuscany and give us the opportunity to compare eight wines from these regions. You will be brought to the village of Montalcino where Brunello is the name of the local Sangiovese variety that is grown. Located south of the Chianti Classico zone, the Montalcino range is drier and warmer than Chianti.<\/p> <p>Your next stop will be in the central region of Tuscany where the Chianti zone is located. Chianti is Tuscany's largest classified wine region and produces over eight million cases a year.<\/p> <p>Your tour will continue on to the Bolgheri region located on the Tuscan coast just south of Livorno and is one of Italy's most prestigious vineyard areas. Its winemaking zone is made up of sloping coastal vineyards and due to the particular characteristics of the soil and micro climate, the grape varieties of Bordeaux origin tend to thrive, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.<\/p> <p><b>Your wines have been carefully selected for you to have the best comparative experience possible and will be provided for you. Please bring $20 cash to contribute to your share of the wines, 4 glasses and a food item to share.<br\/>Can't wait to share this showcase of the Tuscany region with you!!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Blind-Tastings\/events\/228369749\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":10800000,"name":"Tuscan Wine Tour","id":"228369749","time":1459638000000,"updated":1459736867000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348239833000,"name":"Boston Blind Wine Tastings","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":5036692,"urlname":"Boston-Blind-Tastings","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Tasters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01803","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Burlington","address_1":"6 Cambridge Street","lon":-71.186534,"phone":"978-263-0442","name":"Bickford's","id":927984,"state":"MA","lat":42.481553,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.3101387024,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459202228000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey all, this Saturday, April 2 - head down to Bickfords in Burlington. \u00a0Kevin will be hosting and this is a great venue for Open Mics. \u00a0You usually get more songs at this place so be prepared to do 3-4, possibly more if the list is recycled.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It's a fun night so please consider supporting your local Open Mics where YOU are the star of the night.<\/p> <p>~Christine\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Mic-Night-For-musicians-of-all-skill-levels\/events\/229945653\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Open Mic Night - Bickfords Grille","id":"229945653","time":1459638000000,"updated":1459650635000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1364308148000,"name":"Open Mic Night - For musicians of all skill levels","group_lon":-71.1999969482,"id":7791282,"urlname":"Open-Mic-Night-For-musicians-of-all-skill-levels","group_lat":42.5099983215,"who":"Musicians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":10.9866523743,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445362442000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/c88a9e_6f3e74a73ae24995b96756302a0f7e41.jpg_srz_p_923_365_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/c88a9e_6f3e74a73ae24995b96756302a0f7e41.jpg_srz_p_923_365_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Italy's Amalfi Coast April 2 - 10, 2016<\/b><\/p> <p>Includes:<br\/>*Round-trip economy class airfare from JFK or Boston<br\/>*English speaking Italian tour guide throughout \u00a0<br\/>*7 nights accommodations at breathtaking hotel Daily breakfast and dinner<br\/>*Welcome cocktail and farewell dinner with music and entertainment<br\/>*Transfers and sightseeing with assistance by deluxe motor coach<br\/>*Full day guided excursion to Capri and Anacapri<br\/>*Full day guided excursion of the Amalfi Coast including the towns of\u00a0 Ravello \u00a0 \u00a0and Sorrento<br\/>*Demonstration of local artists work<br\/>*Visit to 2 local \u201cLimoncello\u201c factories with samplings<br\/>*Visit to a local Pastaio (pasta maker) factory with samplings<br\/>*Visit to a ceramics factory and participation in a demonstration<br\/>*Local pastry sampling... what is a \"baba'?

Food poisoning decimates the passengers and crew, leaving it up to Striker to land the plane, with the help of a glue-sniffing air traffic controller (Lloyd Bridges) and Striker's vengeful former captain (Robert Stack), who must both talk him down. Along the way, we meet a clutch of stock disaster movie passengers like the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl, a frightened old lady, and two African-American travelers whose \"jive\" has to be subtitled. Leslie Nielsen portrays the plane's doctor, launching a new phase of the actor's career that carried him through the next two decades in several similarly comedic roles.

The first half presents a small sample of the riches of Spanish song from the turn of the 16th century, with music from two famous songbooks, the Cancionero de Palacio and the Cancionero de la Colombina. The second half offers a focus on sacred works (by Crist\u00f3bal de Morales, Francisco Guerrero and Alonso Lobo); the proceedings will conclude in\u00a0grand style with a performance of Sebasti\u00e1n de Vivanco\u2019s glorious Magnificat sexti toni sex vocibus, with instrumental interpolations attributed to Philippe Rogier.<\/p> <p>Seville's wealth (derived from its port\u2019s monopoly on trade with the Empire\u2019s overseas dominions) stimulated a Golden Age in the arts.

The KUBE is more than just a cover band - it's a totally awesome, true '80s Experience! Every super-charged show takes it to the max and guarantees to set the roof on fire and burn down the house. (Metaphorically speaking of course).<\/p> <p>RUBIX KUBE is led by a male and female dynamic duo of karma chameleons, able to transform in the-blink-of-an-eye into the voice and character of any '80s icon. Madonna, Michael Jackson, Cher, Prince, Devo, Bon Jovi, Guns N\u2019 Roses, and more teleport right before your eyes on the same stage, in one concert! Their supporting sidekicks are some of the most-excellent and versatile musicians around. All are decked out in vibrant, vintage '80s threads and with enough hairspray to take down Freddy Krueger, The Terminator, Beetlejuice, and all The Gremlins at once. The KUBE is able to crank out Pop, Rock, New Wave, Dance and Hair Metal hits from the decade of decadence, and perform them just like the originals - yet with their own gnarly twist.<\/p> <p>Talkshow host Kelly Ripa has praised RUBIX KUBE as \"Amazing.

(I'd be covering my eyes in shame if I didn't need my hands to type, right now.)<\/p> <p><br\/>The epic Gourmet cookbook was the first cookbook I ever purchased for my kitchen. I remember it was after I graduated from college, I was outfitting my new apartment and celebrating the next chapter in my life.<\/p> <p><br\/>Can you guess how many recipes I've cooked from this book? None. A big fat whopping zero. Nada. I think I bookmarked one to try out at a later date, and now here I am 10 years later. Sad, but true.<\/p> <p><br\/>My copy of Gourmet is in pristine condition\u2014good as new\u2014and is screaming for someone to crack it open and explore the 1000+ recipes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I welcome you to join me as I dive into this month's featured cookbook. Regardless of the slightly illegible yellow typeface (not sure what the creative director was thinking), there are a bunch of great recipes for us to enjoy.<\/p> <p><b>Note<\/b> :: You don't have to buy a copy of the cookbook in order to participate this event.

Join our Meetup group! All cooking levels are welcome. Don't be shy. You're in good company!<\/p> <p>2. RSVP via Meetup. <b>Note<\/b> :: Each of our \"feast\" events will happen the 1st Sunday of every month, focusing on a different cookbook, author, or blog.<\/p> <p>3. Grab yourself a copy of this month's featured cookbook<b>, <\/b>\"Gourmet\"<b> (ask your library, borrow from a friend, order online or purchase at a local retailer)<\/b> and experiment with a few of the recipes.<\/p> <p>4. Pick a minimum of 1 recipe that you will make for our feast. Be sure to read through all of the instructions to make sure you have the proper tools, dishes, and ingredients. (I made that mistake at a previous feast.)<\/p> <p>5. In the <b>comments section<\/b> below, share which recipe you will be bringing, and the <b>page number<\/b> (this info will help me as I'm preparing a new idea for our feast events). I'll keep track of what everyone is bringing and make sure we don't have any overlaps. <b>Note<\/b> :: It might be wise to pick a backup recipe in case your 1st choice is already taken.<\/p> <p>6. Day of the event (or the day before). Prepare your recipe according to the directions provided in the cookbook. Source ingredients locally, if you can. As tempting as it might be to alter the recipe or make a substitution, please follow the instructions as closely as possible. This will allow the group to truly experience the author's array of recipes.<\/p> <p>7. Get ready for a fun time with really amazing people. We really are a great group of home cooks and foodies. Come with an open mind and empty stomach! Together we will feast on your wonderful food and share our experiences with one another. Feel free to bring your cookbook in order to highlight certain pages or make notes on recipes you especially loved. Post-it notes and pencils are provided.<\/p> <p>8. If you feel inspired to bring fancier serving dishes (for photos), I won't stop you! But it's not essential . . . just slightly more fun.<\/p> <p>9. <b>Don't forget to bring a few small storage containers for leftovers.<\/b> You'll have the best lunch that following Monday, guaranteed.<\/p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/p> <p><b>WHAT'S INCLUDED :: (Stuff you don't have to worry about.)<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

There's no guarantee your dish will remain HOT by the time we are ready to eat. Consider recipes that not only travel well, but also can be served at room temperature.

Slowly, and peacefully, that love and service indicate that by following the path God lays before her (or any of us in real life), Babette carries her cross without trying to make it any lighter or any heavier.<\/p> <p>Babette\u2019s yielding to a solid Peace offered in Christian Faith universally to all at all times and in unity with Jesus the Christ her Risen Savior, makes this \u201cmain character\u201d of the film show that the real Main Character in life is the Holy Presence of God.<\/p> <p>Alleluias are typically an Easter form of expression, in the Victory of Christ through His Holy Cross for the longer Season of Easter (Lent is 40 days and Easter is over fifty days!). And as there is no Resurrection without the Cross, likewise there is Mercy with that realization. This movie is indeed about Mercy, a wonderful way to focus on the Holy Faith on Divine Mercy Sunday. The very beautiful Cross given to us by God, has us proclaiming \u201cAlleluia\u201d in this realization of Divine Mercy as this film partakes in the sweet sufferings we endure through unity in Christ with the Hope of fulfillment in the making.<\/p> <p>Before the movie, we will recite the Chaplet of Divine Mercy (takes about 5 minutes) in both Spanish and English.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Dinner &amp; a Movie!

WFSC will be held at Boston TD Garden from March 28 to April. There are different programs such as women and mens free\/short programs, pairs, and dances. There is also exhibition of champions. Any one of them should be fun to watch, but I picked exhibition of champions because you can watch all the types although only champions' performances. The date is Sunday, April[masked], 2 P.M. to 4:15 P.M.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Figure skate is a combination of art and sports. It's elegant and dynamic. It is much more than we can imagine from the ice skate we see on a local ice rink in weekend. I played figure skate a little bit with my daughter and have seen state, national, Olympic figure skaters practices at local ice rink and it was wonderful for watch. It is a fantastic and a life time opportunity to watch the world best performance in Boston. Let's go to see it! Tix start from $25. You must purchase your own Tix.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We will try to sit together by using this Meetup, but The ticket sales is very fast; the ticket for women free has been already sold out. So, I suggest to get your ticket ASAP. \u00a0If you \u00a0want to buy your ticket together, let me know ASAP.

The Transformational Healing Ritual was developed in 1989 by Vicki Noble as part of the curriculum of the Motherpeace School for Female Shamanic Healers. Since then Noble has facilitated this ritual in venues all over the world, in tandem with some very fine musicians and drummers; she and folk singer Julie Felix facilitated the ritual at the Maternal Gift Economy conference in April 2015.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The ritual invites everyone present to participate, and no experience is required. As indigenous cultures around the world have done on a regular basis, we drum, sing, and perform hands-on healing in a directed ritual setting. After an hour of entraining in this unified state, everyone is blessed with an overall feeling of well-being and those struggling with life-threatening or debilitating illnesses often find themselves in remission.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Vicki Noble is a feminist healer, co-creator of Motherpeace and author of numerous books, including Shakti Woman: Feeling Our Fire, Healing Our World and The Double Goddess: Women Sharing Power; her books have been translated into several languages. Since her shamanic healing powers awakened spontaneously in the late 1970s, she has traveled and taught internationally.<\/p> <p>Julie Felix, grew up in Santa Barbara, moved to England, and shot to fame as the first folk singer on a major record label (Decca), hosting her own BBC television show; she\u2019s been traveling and performing internationally for the last 50 years. In the 1990s, she discovered the Goddess and started singing at Goddess conferences and leading tours.<\/p> <p>Sponsored by Women\u2019s Lodge:<br\/>Please RSVP to Nouri Newman [masked].<\/p> <p>Women only. Cost: $20 per person, less if low-income. Bring drums and rattles.<\/p> <p>...................... Important Update...........................<\/p> <p>We are excited about this Sunday's Transformative Healing Ritual with Vicki Noble and Julie Felix. Please read the following updates carefully:<\/p> <p><br\/>Weather: Snow is forecast for Sunday, but not so much that we need to cancel. We ask that you leave wet footwear outside our ritual space. Please bring slippers or indoor shoes to change into.<\/p> <p>Parking: There are only a few spaces behind the church, most of which will be filled by organizers. If you need space near the entrance because of limited mobility, please email [masked] to save a space for you. The Medford U.U. Church is on 147 High Street; please use the side entrance on Powderhouse Road.<\/p> <p>Drums and rattles: We have a group of designated drummers, so additional drums are not necessary. If you are an experienced drummer able to come at 2:00 to meet with the drumming group, please email Lynn Roberson, [masked]. Do bring a rattle if you have one.<\/p> <p>Pillows and blankets: We will have six \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beds\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (yoga mats with blankets and pillows) in the center of our circle for women receiving healing. If you plan to receive healing and need additional support (an inflatable pad, special pillow, etc.) please bring it with you. We will have several women channeling healing energy around each of the six recipients \u2014 if you need a backjack, zafu, or folded blanket to sit comfortably on the floor, please bring whatever you need.<br\/>Thank you in advance to everyone who is coming to receive the healing energy of this ritual. Vicki's long experience with this process tells her that the greater the healing need, the bigger the energy that we will be able to channel, for the benefit of all participants!<\/p> <p>Registration will begin at 1:45; doors to the ritual space will open at 2:15 (2:00 for drummers). $20 donation is requested, less for low income. We will provide water and light snacks \u2014 fruit, nuts, chocolate, cheese and crackers.

Sometimes F1 Boston may have corporate or private events that would block off a track for a few hours (this option was $800 for a group for 1\/2 hr). F1 Boston recommends that we check on the status of the track a two days before. I will call the Friday before to make sure there is no event blocking the track. I will send out an update email about this. Assuming there are no events blocking the track, each of us can pre-book for our own spot using a credit card on Friday, 4\/1 . By doing this, you don\u2019t have to wait in line; just come in, fill out a waiver form, and be ready to race. Pre-booking requires that you pre-pay the full $40 price or use your groupon.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"4\/1 Those on the waitlist, may rsvp yes now!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ASGABoston\/events\/229222169\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"Go-Kart Racing at F1 Boston in Braintree","id":"229222169","time":1459710000000,"updated":1459734728000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282838020000,"name":"Boston Chapter -American Singles Golf Association\u00ae- ASGA","group_lon":-71.0299987793,"id":1697082,"urlname":"ASGABoston","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01906","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Saugus","address_1":"177 Forest Street","name":"Breakheart Reservation","lon":-71.025955,"id":6940212,"state":"Ma","lat":42.479885,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":66,"headcount":0,"distance":8.59986019135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451581101000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Due to several requests we will be going back\u00a0to The Breakheart Reservation in Saugus.\u00a0We will be walking 3-4 miles. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>We will be inviting several meetup groups.<\/b><\/p> <p>Breakheart Reservation is a 640-acre hardwood forest with jagged, rocky outcroppings, two fresh-water lakes, and a rambling section of the Saugus River.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds. Speed rounds last 5 minutes each.<\/p> <p>*You must register with a valid, correct email address.<\/p> <p>*There are no refunds for cancellations, late arrivals or no-shows.<\/p> <p>*You must arrive and check in within 20 minutes of the advertised start time.<\/p> <p><b>OUR METHOD:<\/b><\/p> <p>Online dating is great. But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable.

When folks got gussied up to go out to a restaurant or a movie? The time when your neighbors went by Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so, and if that baseball went through their window there'd be hell to pay? Okay, so maybe you don't. But some of us (ahem) older types still do. In the last several decades formality has gradually given way to customs of leisure, from dress to language to social stature.

Then the speaker starts.<\/p> <p>Dr. Sara Freedman<\/p> <p>She will talk about the following: \"Many of us grew up learning that the South was the bastion of slavery while the North was the home of abolitionism. New scholarship and current events complicate this picture, particularly the role the North played in supporting the development and extension of slavery during the colonial and antebellum periods. In this talk, Sara Freedman will examine the ways in which slavery as an institution and its day-to-day reality permeated the economic, cultural, moral and social life in the North, particularly in Massachusetts.\"<\/p> <p><br\/>As a long time high school and graduate school educator including at the Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement, Dr. Freedman has led many discussion based courses exploring new topics in U.S. labor and social history. She first became interested in the topic of her talk while attending a National Park Service conference in Lowell in 1993.<\/p> <p><br\/>About the Dinner: Usually about 20 to 35 people composed of members and meetup invitees.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing (if you are interested in both). For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Basic Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear\u00a0(harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the picnic table near bouldering area (usually the round one, furthest from cubbies, if available).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonrocks\/events\/229817920\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"MetroRock Monday","id":"ppzznlyvgbgb","time":1459810800000,"updated":1459823135000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1169007687000,"name":"Rock and Ice Climbing Boston","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":406080,"urlname":"bostonrocks","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Climbers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.73765230179,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435257950000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is the monthly business meeting of SpeakOUT.<\/p> <p><br\/>All members are invited to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you want a copy of the agenda beforehand, contact [masked].<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SpeakOUT\/events\/229268720\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Monthly SpeakOUT Board Meeting","id":"ghlwhlyvgbgb","time":1459810800000,"updated":1459818872000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391592871000,"name":"SpeakOUT","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":12729592,"urlname":"SpeakOUT","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Speakers & Other Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"424 Highland Ave.","lon":-71.12162,"phone":"(617) 629-7641","name":"Blue Shirt Cafe","id":842417,"state":"MA","lat":42.396206,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.64066934586,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458504787000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Scandinavia has chosen a mixed economic system that reduces the gap between the rich and the poor through redistributive taxation, while preserving the benefits of capitalism.

If you can't come on time, that's fine, we usually have a large group until 8:00 PM. M.J. O'Connors is open until 2am if you want to stay extra late, but they will open up the room to the public at 9:00pm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>* If you have SciFi\/Fantasy Books or DVDs that you don't want anymore, feel free to bring them to the meetup and give them away (no sales, please). Be sure to take home anything that isn't claimed before you leave!\u00a0<\/p> <p>* There is no charge for this meetup, but the restaurant that hosts us greatly appreciates your business (and doesn't charge us a room rental fee), so please come hungry (or at least buy a drink). Also, please don't forget to pay your bill before you leave!<\/p> <p><b>TRAVEL:<\/b><\/p> <p>It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the Park Street T stop (Red and green) and a five minute walk from either Arlington and the Boylston stops on the green line<\/p> <p>There are pay parking lots around.

Here is a map of the area.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/229762969\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"Open Cards and Board Game Night in Medford","id":"229762969","time":1459893600000,"updated":1459974272000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02199","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"867 Boylston Street ","lon":-71.083479,"phone":"(617) 247-3200","name":"Back Bay Social Club","id":1356210,"state":"MA","lat":42.348633,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.04644203186,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440181970000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Climate Action Business Association helps local businesses take targeted action on climate change.

The women and men there are building an egalitarian society based at least in part on the writings of the late Murray Bookchin, a U.S. Anarchist. They are fighting against Isis and also against capitalist nations who oppose what they are doing. Their goal is not to establish a separate nation for the Kurds, but to build a grass-roots society of neighborhoods and communities that practice real egalitarianism including between the sexes (which is especially remarkable in that part of the world). For example, all major offices in Rojava are held by two individuals, one male and one female.<\/p> <p><br\/>You can search on line for \"Rojava\" and several links will come up, including one to an article that appeared in the New York TImes Magazine last November.

WHAT IS THIS ?!?!?!?!<\/p> <p>For those who don't know, the Tabletopia platform is starting to open it's doors with it's \"sorta kinda open beta\" going on. It managed to get onto steam yesterday, and it will only pick up steam (excuse the pun) from there. So, I figured that it would be a good time to jump onto the bandwagon.<\/p> <p>What is tabletopia?<\/p> <p>It's a online board game platform featuring (currently) more than 200 board games to (virtually) play!<\/p> <p>How do I Tabletopia?<\/p> <p>Tabletopia is designed to be played via web browser (so no downloading is required!) Currently, it supports Firefox, IE, and Safari (Tabletopia uses Unity, which is why Chrome and Opera are currently unsupported.) It's also available currently on steam. In the future, they will also have a standalone app and iOS and Android support for mobile. Inviting someone else to a table is as easy as sharing a URL link!<\/p> <p>For this first meetup, we will (most likely) use the meetup page as a initial check in point. When the event opens, there will be a link to a text chat room where we can go from there. We'll look at voice chat at a later point.<\/p> <p>Can my computer handle Tabletopia?<\/p> <p>Required specs are here: <a href=\"http:\/\/help.tabletopia.com\/knowledge-base\/system-requirements\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/help.tabletopia.com\/knowledge-base\/system-requirements\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Is Tabletopia Free?<\/p> <p>TL;DR: Yes. If you show, you will be able to play games.<\/p> <p>Long answer: Currently, the system is in Semi-Closed beta. In order to get access to the library, you need to pay 10$ (which goes toward your first subscription once it officially launches.) However, once a room is opened, the owner can invite anyone, INCLUDING people who don't have access. In other words, only one person in each game played has to \"own\" Tabletopia, and everyone else is OK. In the future, if we have a lot of people, and there aren't many with tabletopia access, we may run into problems, but as of right now there's shouldn't be that much demand to cause problems.<\/p> <p>Is there a chat room availible?<\/p> <p>Tabletopia does have in game text chat. I'm not sure if it's possible to have a \"non-game room\" where people can just talk. If for some reason I can't, we'll use this meetup page as a chatroom worst case. Future meetups may use a voice chatroom (skype-like) to make things easier.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Tabletop-Revolution-Worcester\/events\/229995745\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"TableTopia Tuesdays!

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that MTG Boston members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MTGBoston\/events\/229792996\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Wednesday Magic In Medford","id":"229792996","time":1459981800000,"updated":1460041752000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331418092000,"name":"MTG Boston","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":3454302,"urlname":"MTGBoston","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Planeswalkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":6.19995117188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432176954000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please come out and join us for a pleasant evening of competitive party bridge in\u00a0 Newton Centre.\u00a0 Wednesday night bridge here has been a multi-year Metrowest tradition; it is a nice quiet spot with a fireplace, good food, ample table space.\u00a0 The more the merrier, so long as you know how to play bridge and love it.<\/p> <p>This is officially canceled unless 5 players sign up by 5pm.

They all are unique<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Maria Papoila Vinho Verde: Vinho Verde is a region in Portugal, often produces \u00a0simple, inexpensive wines, but this is a high-end standout<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A. Christmann Deidesheim Riesling Trocken (dry) Pfalz: *dry* German Riesling, of which we will see more of with global warming. Classic floral Riesling nose, lush and balanced, but totally dry. Yum!<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Darting Pinot Meunier Kurt D\u00fcrkheimer Feuerberg Riesling Trocken (dry): another surprising German wine, a red Pinot\u00a0Meunier, the lesser known 3rd varietal of Champagne. Light bodied, but good with food.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Ricci El Matt Colli Tortonesi: another standout from Colli Tortonesi area in Piedmonte region of northern Italy.

Our mainstays are ingredients sourced from farms we know and local. Always with a sense of fun.<\/p> <p>Peter Nelson, wine director at Puritan writes:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"Will Gilson, Chef\/Owner, grew up on a a small family farm, and both his parents are still farmers, relying largely on organic practices. This above all informs the wine list at Puritan &amp; Company. While every wine does not come from a small family vineyard, all are at least sustainably farmed. Perhaps it is better to say that our wines are raised by farmers rather than winemakers.\"<\/p> <p>\"Smaller production wines are also a focus. Many of our wines are certified organic or biodynamic, but certification is not a requirement as there are a variety of interpretations of these terms, both legally and philosophically. The crucial distinction between our list and those of most other restaurants in the Boston metro area, is that we do not feature wines fermented with 'selected' yeasts; we prefer to offer wines fermented with ambient yeast present on the grape skins and floating around in the air. We also eschew any mechanical and\/or chemical manipulation of wines except for minimal sulphur at bottling when necessary (which is more often than not). Our wines then would be described as \u201cnatural,\u201d a controversial term, to say the least.\"<\/p> <p>\"Our goal is to show the potential of natural wines, offering delicious examples from anywhere we can find them, and in every price range. Finally, these are the wines most suited to Will\u2019s food, and really, that\u2019s the most important part of my job.\"<\/p> <p>This promises to be a fun and informative event.

His job no longer existed. \"I think they just want to hire younger people,\" his boss at Newsweek told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the vague role of \"marketing fellow.\" What could go wrong?<\/p> <p>HubSpotters were true believers: They were making the world a better place . . . by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; \"shower pods\" became hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the \"content factory,\" Nerf gun fights raged. Groups went on \"walking meetings,\" and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about employees who had \"graduated\" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball \"chair.\"<\/p> <p>Mixed in with Lyons's uproarious tale of his rise and fall at Hubspot is a trenchant analysis of the start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them, a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to reach an IPO and cash out.<\/p> <p>With a cast of characters that includes devilish angel investors, fad-chasing venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and \"wantrapreneurs,\" bloggers and brogrammers, social climbers and sociopaths,Disrupted is a gripping and definitive account of life in the (second) tech bubble.<\/p> <p>:: :: ::<\/p> <p>Praise<\/p> <p>\"Using his trademark wit and clear-eyed analysis, Dan Lyons has delivered a much-needed referendum on the current state of Silicon Valley. In wildly entertaining fashion, Disrupted explores the ways in which many technology companies have come to fool the public and themselves. Lyons has injected a dose of sanity into a world gone mad.\"\u2014Ashlee Vance, New York Times-bestselling author of Elon Musk<\/p> <p>\"Dan 'Fake Steve' Lyons runs such a savage burn on his ex-employer, HubSpot, that the smoke can be seen clear across the country in Silicon Valley. Disrupted is fun, compulsively readable and just might tell us something important about the hypocrisy and cult-like fervor inside today's technology giants.\"\u2014Brad Stone, New York Times-bestselling author of The Everything Store<\/p> <p>\"Dan Lyons goes deep inside a company that uses terms like 'world class marketing thought leaders' to show us how ridiculous, wasteful, and infantile tech start-ups like this can be. And best of all, Lyons does this with his trademark pejorative and hilarious tone.\"\u2014Nick Bilton, New York Times technology columnist<\/p> <p>Event Co-Sponsor: WorkBar Cambridge: <a href=\"http:\/\/boston.workbar.com\/office\/workbar-cambridge\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/boston.workbar.com\/office\/workbar-cambridge\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/boston.workbar.com\/office\/workbar-cambridge\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Purchase the Book: Featured event books will be for sale at the event for 20% off.

Even former Microsoft CEO Steven Ballmer, who once called it a 'cancer', now grudgingly admits its value.\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Frameworks and libraries exist for just about any imaginable task, from advanced networking to sophisticated UI components to functional programming in languages never designed to support this paradigm.\u00a0<\/p> <p>But by its very nature -- the independent efforts of countless developers worldwide with no formal organization responsible for its management -- the universe of open-source solutions can be a forbidding wilderness. Finding, integrating and managing such additions to your own projects is a demanding task.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Several companies offer to manage this complexity for their customers, for a price, but in the spirit of open-source software itself a number of free, community-supported solutions exist to tame the beast.<\/p> <p>In the OS X\/iOS development community, these include Xcode Maven, Xcode Gradle, Carthage, and the one I use for my own work: CocoaPods.<\/p> <p>CocoaPods is both a technology for integrating external code into your own Xcode projects as well as on-line encyclopedia of what solutions are available. You can use it to plug-and-play such libraries into your projects, leaving the details of maintenance and compatibility to the libraries' authors, or customize the integration of each to your own specific needs. And the more ambitious and generous among us can contribute their own open-source creations into this expanding universe of solutions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>My talk will be an overview of CocoaPods for those unfamiliar with it, including examples of how I've used it in my own work.

From the book's Amazon description: \"Why do men's testicles hang outside the body? Why does our appendix sometimes explode and kill us? And who does the Designer like better, anyway-us or squid? These and other questions are addressed in The Not-So-Intelligent Designer: Why Evolution Explains the Human Body and Intelligent Design Does Not. Dr. Abby Hafer argues that the human body has many faulty design features that would never have been the choice of an intelligent creator. She also points out that there are other animals that got better body parts, which makes the Designer look a bit strange; discusses the history and politics of Intelligent Design and creationism; reveals animals that shouldn't exist according to Intelligent Design; and disposes of the idea of irreducible complexity. Her points are illustrated with pictures, wit, and erudition.\"<\/p> <p>Dr Abby Hafer has a D.Phil. in Zoology from Oxford University in England. She is a College Professor teaching Human Anatomy and Physiology at Curry College. Abby has had many years of research in both Physiology and Zoology. She has been giving public lectures on Evolution since 2007.<\/p> <p>The CAH First Wednesday Dialog series brings in outside speakers to share interesting topics related to Humanism -- kind of like a TED Talk, with more of a Humanist bent. Attendees socialize and enjoy refreshments until about 7:15, at which point the speaker presents for as long as they choose, usually until 8:00 or so. At this point the hosts pass the mic around so that all present can join in a group discussion about the topic. When the discussion wraps up, there is more refreshments and socializing until around 9:00 when all attendees are welcome to join the open steering committee meeting.<\/p> <p>CAH takes donations at the door to cover the cost of the meeting; $5 is suggested. Once the room use fee has been taken out of the gate, half of the remaining donation money is given as an honorarium to the speaker. All regular attendees are encouraged to bring refreshments to share.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The entrance to the Hall is around to the right side if you are facing the Meeting House front doors.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonatheists\/events\/229718835\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Abby Hafer, Book Talk: \"The Not-So-Intelligent Designer\"","id":"229718835","time":1459983600000,"updated":1459995170000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035261083000,"name":"The Boston Atheists Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":12763,"urlname":"bostonatheists","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Freethinkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":9.49670410156,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1359821949000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/wednesdaynightknitting\/events\/228900072\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Wednesday Night Knitting","id":"dsnxhfyvgbjb","time":1459983600000,"updated":1459995104000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1220910549000,"name":"Ladies' Knit Nite","group_lon":-71.1600036621,"id":1278247,"urlname":"wednesdaynightknitting","group_lat":42.4799995422,"who":"Knitters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"257 Elm St","address_2":"Davis Square","lon":-71.12175,"phone":"617 629 8717","name":"Diesel Cafe","id":705077,"state":"MA","lat":42.395206,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.59821486473,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446685058000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Written by Lin Cixin, translated by Ken Liu.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We're at the big table in the back!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-797\/events\/226551924\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":14400000,"name":"Cambridge Book Club Readers!!~~Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin and Ken Liu","id":"226551924","time":1459983600000,"updated":1459999371000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1179761947000,"name":"20ish & 30ish Boston Book Club","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":507213,"urlname":"bookclub-797","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.70690178871,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458017163000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let\u2019s get together to appreciate and shoot this small but interesting museum of industrial equipment.

By the 1880\u2019s, Boston\u2019s water system couldn\u2019t keep up with the rapid growth of the city and its water needs. Chestnut Hill was identified as the location for a new reservoir and main pumping station. The original station was built in 1887, but by the 1890\u2019s, it was clear that demand had quickly outstripped the ability to transport sufficient water. The need for more water resulted in the installation of increasingly powerful (and enormous!) pumping engines, which operated every day until the 1970\u2019s, when the site was taken offline, and Boston\u2019s water supply shifted to the Quabbin Reservoir<\/i>.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BCCevents\/events\/229599924\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":7200000,"name":"Brookline Waterworks Museum","id":"229599924","time":1459983600000,"updated":1459991977000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1403499242000,"name":"Boston Camera Club","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":15254542,"urlname":"BCCevents","group_lat":42.3300018311,"who":"BCC Trippers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01824","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Chelmsford","address_1":"90 Drum Hill Road","lon":-71.362696,"phone":"978-654-7990 ","name":"Panera","id":984022,"state":"MA","lat":42.62431,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.6252555847,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1317832493000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join us every first Wednesday of the month for our friendly and casual social get together where we discuss the latest news and events in the atheist and secular community and strike up various conversations relating to atheism (philosophy, humanism, a\/theology, politics, and scientific skepticism).

Spring cleaning can be an emotional issue as well, and we won\u2019t leave that out of the story!<\/p> <p><b>Wednesday, April 6th, 2016<br\/>7:00pm \u2013 9:00pm<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.commonwealthherbs.com\/contact\/directions\/\">25 St. Mary\u2019s Court, Brookline<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>The fee for this class is $20.<\/p> <p>RSVP by filling out our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.commonwealthherbs.com\/contact\/\">contact form<\/a>, emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>, or calling[masked]-5274.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/commonwealthherbs.com\/diy-herbal-cleaners-class\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/commonwealthherbs.com\/diy-herbal-cleaners-class\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/commonwealthherbs.com\/diy-herbal-cleaners-class\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Vital-Bodies\/events\/229989450\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Simple Herbs for Sound Sleep","id":"229989450","time":1459983600000,"updated":1459991021000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347316193000,"name":"VITAL Body, Mind & Soul","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":4869532,"urlname":"Vital-Bodies","group_lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Vital Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Somerville","address_1":"6 William St.","lon":-71.119963,"phone":"617.623.1212","name":"Unity Church of God","id":790021,"state":"MA","lat":42.399172,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.72638845444,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442549307000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022 Heal the emotional wounds of past relationships<br\/>\u2022 Transform deep seated patterns of abandonment and rejection<br\/>\u2022 Let go of unhealthy dysfunctional relationships<br\/>\u2022 Develop the ability to remain centered in the core of your being<br\/>\u2022 Become truly loving and accepting of yourself<br\/>\u2022 Develop a warm magnetic presence that will draw others to you<br\/>\u2022 Cultivate inner beauty<br\/>\u2022 Increase your capacity to give and receive love<br\/>\u2022 Attract a healthy and loving partner<br\/>\u2022 Create healthier and more fulfilling relationships<br\/>\u2022 Develop a stronger connection with the higher power<br\/>\u2022 Learn to evolve spiritually through your relationships<\/p> <p><br\/>My friend Sema was telling me about how she had fallen for a man, but he had not called her in some time. Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Our contemporary world seems to be a panoply of strange behavior, some merely strange, others horrifying and indescribably despicable. It sometimes seems that\u00a0 rational and philosophical reasoning has reached its limits and only psychology perhaps, or neuroscience has a hope of coming to grips with it. Maybe so, but I am biased in favor of a methodical blending of the rational mind (philosophy) and the subconscious mind (e.g. psychology, hypnotism, the neurosciences) can ultimately fix what ails humanity. The crux of my belief is that the irrational can be rationally understood\u00a0 so that ultimately, in a sort of alchemy, irrationality can be\u00a0 transmutated into rationality.<\/p> <p>The relationship between philosophy and hypnosis goes further than a direct ironing out of conflicts between conscious and subconscious\u00a0 beliefs. I combine hypnotism and philosophy in my hypnotherapy and philosophical counseling practice, and their interconnections are a principle theme of my book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ethical-Empowerment-Virtue-Beyond-Paradigms-ebook\/dp\/B00IZ2FILG\/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394712065&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=ethical+empowerment\"><i>Ethical Empowerment Virtue Beyond the Paradigms<\/i><\/a> (2014). An important interconnection is between philosophical perspectivism and the use of \"reframing\" in hypnotherapy, which was first developed by the renowned psychiatrist and hypnotherapist, Milton Erickson.<\/p> <p><br\/>While the nature of hypnosis became understood as more properly a function of suggestion than spirituality (e.g. Mesmer), the linkage between hypnosis and spirit and\/or transcendental mind has persisted in the minds of many metaphysically minded people. The interconnections between the natural state now called hypnosis and psychic phenomena grew\u00a0 stronger in the late nineteenth century. This is seen in such classic works as <i>The Law of Psychic Phenomena\u00a0 <\/i>by the American Thomson Jay Hudson and<i> Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death<\/i> by F.W.H. Myers. The latter was one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research in Britain. Both Hudson and Myers believed that \"subjective mind\" (Hudson) or \"subliminal mind\" (Myers) had connections with the spirit or with psychic or paranormal phenomena which are obscured and covered by the activity and interference of the conscious mind. This is a view that would also be later echoed by the French philosopher, Henri Bergson.<\/p> <p>*******************<\/p> <p>Your RSVP indicates that you plan on listening to the show.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

R is the premier and most widely used Analytics language. Azure Machine Learning Studio is built on it and Microsoft recently acquired the R platform vendor, Revolution Analytics, to integrate R into SQL Server 2016. The need to learn R is clear. This presentation will give you the basics about R programming. We will start with a background on what R is and where it came from. Then you will learn how to install the language shell and R Studio, the development environment. You\u2019ll learn about the unique vector based architecture of R which makes it such a powerful analysis tool. Through examination of examples you will learn the about the language. We'll also see some examples of R's powerful visualization features. The goal of this session is to demystify R and give you a basic understanding of R programming. You will leave feeling that R is fun! The focus is on the programming language so only a minimal understanding of statistics is needed.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/b\/a\/600_300757562.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Pizza is going to be served at 6:30 courtesy of Foliage<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Bryan Cafferky...<\/p> <p>Bryan Cafferky, of BPC Global Solutions LLC, is an independent Business Intelligence consultant with decades of experience in information technology focused on the Microsoft stack.

It is this experience toward which the course is directed.\" (ACIM Manual for Teachers)<\/p> <p>Designed to correct perception and lead to a universal experience of knowledge, A Course In Miracles has been translated into 23 languages, is referenced and utilized by many of today's most reknowned spiritual teachers, and has inspired countless books and curriculums based on its teachings. But it can be a difficult book to grasp. It is lengthy, the writing is abstract, and its use of Christian terminology alienates many.<\/p> <p>And yet it has become one of the most influential spiritual books of today. Join us as we dive into it, and are led to understand its principles against the backdrop of our own personal experiences and insights. Beginner as well as advanced Course students are welcome. We'll start with a short meditation, and then use a reading from the Course as an entry point into our time together. Cost $5 per person.<\/p> <p>Bringing a copy of the book is helpful, but not necessary. Recommended (but again not necessary) is the combined volume that includes the three supplements (Clarification of Terms; Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, and Practice; The Song of Prayer), available online from The Foundation For Inner Peace at <a href=\"http:\/\/acim.org\">acim.org<\/a>.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"From Concord St.: we're 4\/10th's of a mile down Russell St. on the right, the driveway after Fraser Farm.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/A-Course-In-Miracles-Discussion-Group-Carlisle\/events\/229942045\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"Join us as we discuss A Course In Miracles and apply its principles to our lives","id":"dlbfclyvgbkb","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460077515000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1397303252000,"name":"A Course In Miracles Discussion Group - Carlisle","group_lon":-71.3499984741,"id":13870682,"urlname":"A-Course-In-Miracles-Discussion-Group-Carlisle","group_lat":42.5299987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02452","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Waltham","address_1":"45 Woburn Street","name":"Meadow Green Nursing Home","lon":-71.219124,"id":10960472,"state":"MA","lat":42.407642,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.30916404724,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432295260000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello,<\/p> <p>Thank you for visiting this page.

How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

With her alluring Heft, a queer Black woman in the East Bay draws a bevy of suitors and scoundrels.<\/p> <p>~Free community event ~ Appetizers\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/beautifulqwocfilms.eventbrite.com\">Reserve your seat (s)<\/a>\u00a0!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nSponsored by Fenway Women's Health , QWOCMAP, Edge Media Network , and Wicked Queer<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lesbians-of-Color-Symposium\/events\/229942049\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":9000000,"name":"Beautiful Possibilities - Queer Women of Color Cinema Pt. 1 & Soiree ","id":"229942049","time":1460152800000,"updated":1460163273000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1456979793000,"name":"Lesbians of Color Symposium","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19655507,"urlname":"Lesbians-of-Color-Symposium","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Medford","address_1":"161 College Ave.","name":"Gantcher Center","lon":-71.116013,"id":24376317,"state":"MA","lat":42.408165,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.08144187927,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455843596000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>And so, the quest for Finding Pedro continues - this time by fighting against cancer at Relay for Life! I'm proud to say that this will be my third year leading a team, and it would be an honor to attend this event with all of you =)<\/p> <p>WHAT IS RELAY FOR LIFE?<br\/>For those of you unfamiliar with Relay, it is a community event where teams who have been raising money for the American Cancer Society come together for a night of honoring those who are suffering from or who have lost their lives to cancer. Of course, this night is filled with plenty of fun activities, and is an exciting, meaningful event ideal for bringing a community together!<\/p> <p>HOW DO I JOIN PEDRO'S TEAM?<br\/>1) Click this link: <a href=\"http:\/\/main.acsevents.org\/site\/TR\/?team_id=1992831&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=73142\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/main.acsevents.org\/site\/TR\/?team_id=1992831&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=73142<\/a><br\/>2) Didn't work? Go to relayforlife.org, then click 'Find an Event.' Find the event that matches the date and address listed here. Then, find Pedro's Friends under the team names.<br\/>3) Register, and you're ready to go! I'll send you a message once I get confirmation you've joined.<\/p> <p>OTHER INFO<br\/>1) Commitment: Yes, this IS a 12 hour event. No, you don't have to stay for the entire time. EVENT GOAL: Since cancer never sleeps, the idea is that at least one team member will be walking around the track at all times. Want to walk early, then go party hard? Great. More of a night owl, and want to keep the fun times rolling at 3am? That works, too!<br\/>2) If you can't commit: Then donate, and support your friends in a worthy cause! Cancer has touched the lives of countless loved ones around us, so please click the 'Donate to this Team' button, or dedicate a Luminara to honor a loved one! It feels good =)<br\/>3) Spreading the Word! I highly encourage you to share your personal page on Facebook, through email, and certainly through word of mouth! My team fundraised nearly $5500 last year, and I'd love for FP to break that record! Let's join together to raise money in hopes of find a cure at last!<\/p> <p>NEED THE TEAM LINK AGAIN?<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/main.acsevents.org\/site\/TR\/?team_id=1992831&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=73142\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/main.acsevents.org\/site\/TR\/?team_id=1992831&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=73142<\/a><\/p> <p>MORE QUESTIONS?<br\/>Facebook me, or email me at: [masked]<\/p> <p>I hope you join!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Finding-Pedro\/events\/228961361\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":43200000,"name":"Pedro's Friends Fight Cancer: Relay For Life (Important Info. in Description)","id":"228961361","time":1460152800000,"updated":1460196666000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1437396831000,"name":"Finding Pedro","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18754208,"urlname":"Finding-Pedro","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Pedro's Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02116","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"51 Huntington Ave ","lon":-71.078006,"phone":"(617) 424 - 8500","name":"MiniBar","id":1218644,"state":"MA","lat":42.348487,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.896275758743,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459984264000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>3Beards Boston bringing <b>Silicon Drinkabout<\/b> this week back to <b>Minibar <\/b>on Huntington Avenue on Friday from 6-9PM.<\/p> <p>Be sure to drop by, invite your colleagues, your friends, and come and meet like minded people who just want to chill after a long work week of \"making the world a better place\".\u00a0<\/p> <p>Techies, entrepreneurs, and people who just hustle and grind in the daily startup life, all are welcome!\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/3-beards.com\/silicondrinkabout\/boston","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Silicon-Drinkabout-Boston\/events\/230183765\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Silicon Drinkabout Minibar Revenge","id":"230183765","time":1460152800000,"updated":1460164864000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449079944000,"name":"Silicon Drinkabout Boston","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19175708,"urlname":"Silicon-Drinkabout-Boston","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Drinkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Boston","address_1":"581 Washington St","name":"Sip Wine Bar and Kitchen","lon":-71.062462,"id":21029672,"lat":42.353477,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.593723237514,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459735394000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to our Networking Night.

Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill. While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries.<\/p> <p>Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics to Energy Medicine, cellular biology, neurophysiology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health, etc.<\/p> <p>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\" which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book \"Beggars At God's Banquet\" based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing in the spring.<\/p> <p>Barry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing\". His voice students learn the relationship of ego to breath patterns, and how to surrender control to a higher power. Barry is qualified to teach about miracles, because he had his own miracle. He restored his singing voice by recognizing the need for spiritual grace and surrender of control to a higher power, after Western doctors said he had damaged his voice beyond repair.<\/p> <p>Barry can be reached at [masked].<\/p> <p>**************************<\/p> <p>Most ingredients are organic and of the highest standards.<\/p> <p>Come be in community and enjoy a healthy meal!<\/p> <p>Call (617)[masked] or e-mail [masked]<br\/>for reservations and directions.<\/p> <p>Please rsvp no later than noon on Friday.<\/p> <p>Sliding scale of $20 - $35\/meal.<\/p> <p>(Note: Preferred payment is by cash or check.)<br\/>(Let David know if interested in helping him cook in exchange for a free meal.

Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill.\u00a0 While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics to Energy Medicine, cellular biology,\u00a0 neurophysiology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health,\u00a0etc.<\/p> <p>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"<i>Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\"<\/i> which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book <i>\"Beggars At God's Banquet\"<\/i>\u00a0 based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing in the spring.<\/p> <p>Barry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing\".\u00a0 His voice students learn the relationship of ego to breath patterns, and how to surrender control to a higher power.\u00a0 Barry is qualified to teach about miracles, because he had his own miracle.\u00a0 He restored his singing voice by recognizing the need for spiritual grace and surrender of control to a higher power, after Western doctors said he had damaged his voice beyond repair.<\/p> <p>Barry can be reached at [masked].<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**************************<\/p> <p><b>Most\u00a0ingredients are organic and of the highest standards.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Come be in community <\/b><b>and enjoy a healthy meal!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Call (617)[masked] or e-mail <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/b> <b><br\/><\/b> <b>for reservations and directions.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Please rsvp no later than noon on Friday.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Sliding scale of $20 - $35\/meal.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>(Note: Preferred payment is by cash or check.)<\/b> <b><br\/><\/b> <b>(Let David know if interested in<\/b> <b>helping him cook in exchange for a free meal.
