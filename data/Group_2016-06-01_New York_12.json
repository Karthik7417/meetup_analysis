Our workshops aim to be as fun as they are informative. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Jam Sessions have come out of a desire to start to tackle some of the more specific concerns our clients come to us with: &nbsp;How to give an elevator pitch, Networking for Introverts, Negotiation, Interview Skills, Dealing with interruptions, Pitching Important Ideas.&nbsp; While these are big issues that will certainly not be fully resolved in an hour, we can get you started in thinking about them in a different way- and give you a few tools to add to your tool bag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1st Session will be Art of the Elevator Pitch (Nov. 18th, 6:30-7:30 pm. Location: Manhattan). Learn to articulate your value and values with ease, savvy, and style. Our attention spans are shorter. Our lives are busier. And our mental hard drives are at capacity. So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience. Workshop participants will be able to get on your feet, practice, and start to make some connections with other professionals. Post packet PDF included.

The bulk of the classes are related to helping your dog attain the skills necessary to achieve Canine Good Citizen, an AKC-recognized title. The skills of CGC should be something every dog owner strives for. We offer all CGC classes as small classes so that you get personal attention and help during each class.

And everyone already has it \u2014 including you. Become balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually.

Within each of us are layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your own way. And our experts are always available to help. Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of Sahaja Yoga Meditation every day may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy (called kundalini in the yogic tradition) and light the path to lifelong transformation.

Show up and learn how to move past that phase.<\/p>\n<p>Let's be present in the movement and transparent about our future actions.&nbsp; Let\u2019s be proactive, be the catalyst to change and always be prepared to react to the new unforseen events that affect our lives.&nbsp; Let's build with like-minded people that are thinking clear and concisely about their current cash flows.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>We will then continue by disecting some case studies of life situations that might cause one to lose that said peace of mind and then best practices on how to move forward with a safe and sound mindset.&nbsp; While we go through our presentation, we will discuss hidden current costs that can effect your current monetary situations.&nbsp; We will also be sharing solutions to create a sanctuary in ourselves by getting clear on our cash flow realities. We suggest you share issues and solutions throughout the process.&nbsp;We always make sure to leave at least 15 to 30mins for networking encouragement and questions.&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194076751,"name":"Kevin Jean-Charles","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/highres_251237385.jpeg","photo_id":251237385,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/member_251237385.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/e\/9\/thumb_251237385.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"NYC Peace with Cash flows Meetup","id":19100692,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-PeacewithCashflows","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Cash Flow Peace Encouragers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446957333000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"volleyball","name":"Volleyball","id":705},{"urlkey":"sports","name":"Sports and Recreation","id":10451},{"urlkey":"beach-volleyball","name":"Beach Volleyball","id":18266},{"urlkey":"indoor-volleyball","name":"Indoor Volleyball","id":22155},{"urlkey":"volleyball-league","name":"Volleyball League","id":23851},{"urlkey":"wallyball","name":"Wallyball","id":26975}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Wallyball-Club\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><b>Who we are:&nbsp;<\/b><span>Brooklyn Wallyball club has called Eastern Athletic Club (EAC) it's home since 1981. &nbsp;In that time it has become the undisputed all time winningest Wallyball program anywhere in the country &nbsp;with more than 70 National titles at all levels in all divisions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>If you are either an Open or Advanced level Volleyball\/Wallyball &nbsp;player we encourage you to join this meetup and come join us for a great and&nbsp;<\/span>competitive<span>&nbsp;Wallyball game.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><b>Location:&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/span><span>Eastern Athletic Club (EAC) &nbsp;43 Clark St. Brooklyn,N.Y. &nbsp; Closest Subway is the Clark Street station on the 2\/3 line<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><b>Time: <\/b>&nbsp;Every&nbsp;<\/span><span>SUNDAY 3pm -7pm<\/span><\/p>\n<p> We will assess your basic Volleyball skills when you first join to determine the most appropriate division for you to play in. &nbsp;We reserve the right to deny anyone membership that does not possess the minimum basic skills required in order to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Divisions: <\/b>&nbsp;Men's, Women and Co-ed Triples and doubles at the advanced and open levels<\/p>\n<p><b>Membership:<\/b> Membership is for the entire season only, which runs from November 1st 2015 through May 1st, 2016. &nbsp; Membership fee is $220 which covers access to EAC and the court fees during the allotted Wallyball time. &nbsp;&nbsp;This membership fee is NOT prorated &nbsp;so the best value is to come as early in the season as possible.<\/p>\n<p><b>To encourge you to check the game out before you sign up, notify our leadership team about what day you wish to come and special arrangements with the facility will be made to provide a ONE-TIME ONLY complimentary admission &nbsp;to play. &nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <b>Videos:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73g_9a9tieg&amp;list=PLT55ohxoGKCyO6ERfUG3btQX1wlv3E5BG\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73g_9a9tieg...<\/a><\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36-sJ5JISwA\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36-sJ5JISwA<\/a> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/highres_444062613.jpeg","photo_id":444062613,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/600_444062613.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/3\/5\/thumb_444062613.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":194760862,"name":"George L.

Let's go skiing. This group is for the skier who doesnt want to go far - just a day trip to Windham\/Hunter and it's cool! Tired of getting up at 4:30am to catch a bus for an overpriced day trip to Windham or Hunter? Problem solved! Let's carpool from the Westchester\/Rockland\/Lower Fairfield area for a casual day trip to Windham or Hunter. Let's leave at 9am and get a half-day ticket. Or ski a full day and still leave at 8am! Both ski areas are just over 2 hrs from the Westchester area and provide enough variety on the slope or off the slopes. No need to rush home after a day of skiing.......let's listen to some music in the lodge and relax before heading out. The goal of this group is to have meetups at local Westchester bars so we can meet other ski buddies and arrange carpools so we can all ski together. And also to have a drink or 2! If you're into hanging out at the lodge, thats cool too....no need to be a skier.

Whether you are a long time business owner or just starting out, working for yourself, can be a very lonely and sometimes a little scary. We don't always know all the right things to do and we are often afraid, ashamed or too stubborn to ask for help. By nature, we are passionate, giving, independent and creative. A community of like-minded women going for it in their lives and businesses is a force to be reckoned with. When we take out the competitive mindset and instead trust that there is success for each of us, that rising tide lifts all ships.

An integral part of our organization is the Women of Color Caucus (WOCC) which meets separately from white women to better understand how white supremacy intersects with other forms of oppression. Our group hosts public meetings the third Tuesday of every month at The Commons at 388 Atlantic Ave, and all women are welcome. <br><\/p>\n<p>NWL won a big victory in 2013 when the Morning-After Pill was put over the counter for all ages, the fruits of a 10-year battle that included a sit-in at the FDA, illegally giving out the pill to show the ridiculousness of the restrictions, and a class action lawsuit. Current priorities are the right to abortion and birth control and the overthrow of the double day--women's roles as full-time caretakers and full time employees. Most recently, we printed and distributed 1969 \"This Oppresses Women\" stickers after reviving them from the Redstockings Archive. We got a lot of publicity when they were used against Protein World's Beach Body ads in Union Square, and they continue to appear on other offending ads all over the city. NWL feminists are also organizing the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign in NYC. <br><\/p>\n<p>We are a group for women who want to fight back against male supremacy and win more freedom for women. We believe that change comes about from the actions of everyday people\u2014not politicians, the courts, lobbyists, or the media. The freedoms we have now were won by movements of women, organizing and fighting for change. Men did not become less sexist or decide to give women the vote or legalize birth control because of our individual abilities to reason with them, educate them, or because they love us so much. The inequalities between women and men are political problems that require a collective solution.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Check out womensliberation.org to get involved. <br><\/p>\n<p>Unless specifically noted, all events are for women only.

I\u201dd always been naturally rebellious and found it hard to accept what was taught at Sunday school. Sound Familiar? At the age of about 7, I realized there was something missing while sitting in Church services. I felt like God had a bigger plan. A plan for me to SERVE!<\/p>\n<p>Years passed while my searched continued for connection, purpose, and impact until the day my perspective was changed forever\u2026 at my feet written as clear as the day was\u2026\u201dJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d. That was the day I was CALLED SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>I found myself standing on the farthest rock in the ocean I could find. I\u2019d been traveling for miles with 50 lbs. of gear and had not seen my family in two months. As the sun began to set the sky had lit up like fire. The contrast between the blue ocean and the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was as if God himself was staring back at me looking deep within my soul. My hair began to stand up the same way it had when I found \u201cJESUS IS THE WAY\u201d written in concrete so many years before. A voice from within, not the voice you hear from internal conversations you have in your head on a normal day, this was all encompassing vibrating energy coming from both outside and within, it was coming from my heart and the entire world around me. The words spoken to me were \u201cWELL DONE, YOU MADE IT\u2026NOW GO AND TELL THE WORLD.<\/p>\n<p>The adventures and the journey are long, hard, and sometimes painful, but also transformational, rewarding, and have brought much joy and fulfillment in my life. I continue to push my limits, praying \u201cJESUS CHRIST MY LORD AND GOD IN YOU I PUT MY TRUST\u201d Through all the chaos and adventure, and a chance meeting with my Guardian Angel who taught me what unconditional love is I had found what I had been looking for since the age of 7. These experiences have absolutely transformed my life and outlook but most importantly by putting my faith in Jesus and believing he could provide everything and more that we needed I experienced a level of living a life that many only dream about.<\/p>\n<p>Where God lead me next, and the blessings he bestowed on me to this day absolutely blow my mind. Where ever we go, what ever we do, when we get there we do what is needed Period. All you have to do is show up and the big man above will handle the rest. What will you do next? Did you feel it? Will you answer the call to SERVE.<\/p>\n<p>After a long and sometimes lonely journey, I\u2019ve found wise counsel and fellowship in Christ. Now it\u2019s your turn, we climb this mountain and embark on the adventure together.<\/p>\n<p>John Albino \u2013 Mission Leader<\/p>\n<p>John Albino started Absolute Music Studios with one goal in mind\u2026 to create a warm and inviting musical atmosphere that he himself would want to come to. It all started with the desire to live a more community-oriented life and to be around to raise his children instead of living on the road, which he did for many years. John has worked with musicians from many of the biggest names in the music business over the years, including KISS, The Pretenders, Wings, Billy Joel, Foreigner, Pat Travers and Quiet Riot, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>He has also worked as a studio musician, playing on sessions with many top producers including Stephen Gelfas and Charlie Midnight. <br>Now he has created a first class music studio staffed with the best player-teachers in the area. He brings decades of musical expertise and the benefit of years of front-line professional experience to Absolute Music, his own unique creation.

I am Diana S. Ramos, a Registered Dietitian\/Nutritionist and yoga instructor. I practice a mind-body approach to nutrition and well-being, and empower each individual to develop a healthy relationship with their bodies, mind and food. My mission is to help individuals thrive into a more joyful, healthy and mindful lives. I discovered the real benefits of yoga in the most difficult times in my life. I was at my peak levels of stress, anxiety and unhappiness. Yoga helped me find peace within myself. Through the practice of yoga I discovered that stress, anxiety and unhappiness were rooted from not living and accepting the present moment. I noticed I was either in living in the past or worrying about the future, but never present moment, in what is. Yoga helped me to kindly move into the present moment, decrease self-judgement, and cultivate self-compassion, self-love and self-acceptance. I would like to share this experience and practice with you. This group offers yoga and wellness workshops, to help you dive into the present moment, release stress and anxiety, and help you to compassionately take care of you. Allow yoga to help you connect with your body. Yoga is not about how flexible you are but how flexible you can become on your mat and in real life with you and your thoughts. Yoga is not about competing, comparing, or judging, it is about self-acceptance, self-love and self-compassion. Yoga is a practice where no experience necessary. The only requirement is you and an open mind. This is an invitation to take care of your body and mind. My Motto: Embrace. Love. Nurture. Embrace who you are. Love yourself just as you are. In order to Nurture yourself the right way.","lon":-73.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194388034,"name":"Diana Ramos","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/highres_250709693.jpeg","photo_id":250709693,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/member_250709693.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/3\/f\/d\/thumb_250709693.jpeg"}},"members":138,"name":"Nourish Body & Mind","id":19129142,"state":"NY","urlname":"Nourish-Mind-and-Body","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Body-Mind Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447736862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"productdesign","name":"Product Design","id":2993},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"business-ideas","name":"Business Ideas","id":15928},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"ideas","name":"ideas","id":49075}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Creative-Lab\/","rating":0,"description":"The Creative Lab is a place for people to exercise their creativity.

We want to meet at least once a week, to speak of Jesus Christ and the Scriptures, to pray together, to continue in the apostles teachings and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread.\n\nIt is written, there is one who scatters, yet increases more; and there is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty. This group is to \"scatter\" the word of God, to give free course to the Scriptures. As long as we are willing to rightly divide the word of truth, every man and woman has a part in the conversation. We can edify each other in love. I put one block of truth, and you can put another block of truth.\n\nYou can expect to be part of a spiritual conversation, and the opportunity to exercise your spiritual gifts as long as we do all things decently and in order. When we come together, every single member has. One has a psalm, another a doctrine, someone else a tongue, another one a revelation, the next man an interpretation. Let all things be done for edifying of the body of Christ.\n\nThe Gospel\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God unto the meek, liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, the proclamation of the day of salvation, the acceptable year of the Lord (Isa 52:6-7, 61:1-2, Luk 4:18-19, 8:1); whereby God sent and anointed his son Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel and to be the saviour of the world. (1 Jn 4:14) The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes whether Jew or Greek (Rom 1:16-17) to all them that call upon him (Rom 10:12-15). For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  The Gospel declares that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, he was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures, that he was seen of Cephas, the twelve and then of five hundred brethren at once. (1 Cor 15:1-3) Through the Gospel we understand that that the stone which was rejected is become the head of the corner.  Jesus Christ who was rejected and crucified rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and is now exalted far above all principalities and powers (Ps 118:22-23, Mat 21:42, Acts 4:10-12, 1 Cor 15:1-3, Eph 1:20-21). This tried stone is none other than Jesus Christ; whose name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isa 7:10-14, Mat 1:21-23; Is 8:10-18, 9:6-7; 1 Pet 2:4-8). This is the true God and eternal life (1 Jn 5:20).\n\nAn essential part of the gospel is understanding what it means that Jesus is the Christ.  It is written, that He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God did not give the Spirit by measure unto Him (Jn 3:34). This verse speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, a body that God prepared, so that the fullness of the Father would be manifested in him (Heb 10:5). As the Scripture says, For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col 1:19).  This is the mystery of Christ, even the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory (1Ti 3:16). He that sees Jesus, sees Him that sent him (Jn 12:45). This is to the mind that has understanding. The name of the Father is Jesus. The name of the Son is Jesus. The name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus. These are spiritual words, and they owe to be discerned spiritually. This is what Jesus meant, when he said that he was the Son of God. For since the very beginning it was written, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness (Gen 1:16). Jesus Christ is that man, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature (Col 1:15). God was in Christ, and not another. I repeat again, Christ received the Spirit of God without measure. The prophet Isaiah foresaw this and speaking as the oracles of God wrote that a child will be born unto us, that a son will be given. And that his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father. We are also called to be partakers of such fullness, to come in the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to grow unto that perfect man, unto the measure and stature of Christ (Eph 4:13). We are also called to receive the Spirit of Christ. God will give us the Holy Ghost if we obey Him (Acts 5:32). Men and brethren, what must we do in order to obey God?\n\nJesus Christ came preaching repentance and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat 4:17). In order to enter into the kingdom of God we must be born again of the water and of the Spirit (Jn 3:3-5). Those early disciples in the book of Acts were born again when they repented, were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (born of the water), and received the infilling of the Holy Ghost (born of the Spirit). (Acts 2:37-41, 8:12-17, 9:17-18, 10:44-48, 19:1-6) The baptisms in the book of Acts were done in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 4:12, 8:12, 10:48, 19:5, Gal 3:27, Rom 6:3-4, Col 2:12). In order to obey the Gospel and enter into the kingdom of God we too must do what those early disciples did and what Jesus commanded. Repent therefore, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you too shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38-39). Please take the time to look up the scriptures listed in this study (Acts 17:11).","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/highres_445157812.jpeg","photo_id":445157812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/600_445157812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/9\/4\/thumb_445157812.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":182770744,"name":"Andy Rodriguez","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/highres_254063837.jpeg","photo_id":254063837,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/member_254063837.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/d\/1\/d\/thumb_254063837.jpeg"}},"members":5,"name":"Church In Manhattan","id":19136615,"state":"NY","urlname":"Church-In-Manhattan","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Christians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1447943628000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dv","name":"Digital Video","id":427},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"motion-graphics","name":"Motion Graphics","id":19344},{"urlkey":"final-cut-pro","name":"Final Cut Pro","id":19965},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"3d-animation","name":"3D Animation","id":25718},{"urlkey":"compositing","name":"Compositing","id":29130},{"urlkey":"editors-dps-directors-producers-writers","name":"Editors, DP's, Directors, Producers, Writers","id":29244},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"vfx","name":"VFX","id":30988},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"post-production-editing-visual-effects-vfx","name":"POST-PRODUCTION: EDITING & Visual Effects VFX","id":468552},{"urlkey":"video-and-computer-animation","name":"Video and computer animation","id":1162242},{"urlkey":"animation-and-visual-effects","name":"Animation and visual effects","id":1250832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/postproductionworkshops\/","rating":0,"description":"Live workshops and user group meetings on making workflow with FCPX, DaVinci Resolve, Fusion, Smoke and a bunch of other stuff.

Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, take measurements of habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile.

It becomes easy to literally see your limitations and problems while also seeing powerful solutions no other tools can provide. You will enhance the best of yourself while upgrading your life in ways beyond your dreams. Join this group to start UPGRADING YOUR LIFE each week. You will have fun while making real changes in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each Session members will hold in their hands printed sheets of Art work they will use to record parts of their minds, solve problems, communicate with their minds (different from meditation), record measurements of mental activity. With the Art Work members of the community will be able to show each others what they are working on each week. Personal improvement moves form a philosophical talk to show me your Art work and what you are working on. Members will select projects and goals they will work on as individuals and within the community making possible everything form habit change, weight release, less stress, greater mental focus, solving business problems, removing fears and anxieties, becoming free from shyness, emotional clarity and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>GAIN CLARITY ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IN YOUR BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LIFE<\/p>\n<p>MAKE REAL CHANGES TO YOUR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND ACTIONS<\/p>\n<p>DISCOVER THE HIDDEN ASSETS NEEDED TO BUILD YOUR FUTURE<\/p>\n<p>TRANSFORM YOUR PAST INTO AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF NEW POSSIBILITIES<\/p>\n<p>USE YOUR EMOTIONS AS RESOURCES<\/p>\n<p>YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW TO SET AND ACHIEVE GOALS IN THE REAL WORLD<\/p>\n<p>DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS<\/p>\n<p>EACH SESSION WILL BE WILL BUILD ON THE LAST AND TAKE TO THE NEXT STEP<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":105794502,"name":"James Murdock","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/highres_149903682.jpeg","photo_id":149903682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/member_149903682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/8\/2\/thumb_149903682.jpeg"}},"members":57,"name":"UPGRADE AND RESET YOUR LIFE","id":19154726,"state":"NY","urlname":"UPGRADE-AND-RESET-YOUR-LIFE","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"BRAIN-MIND SETTERS"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Flushing","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448481823000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian","id":309},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"tantric","name":"Tantra","id":10146},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"kirtan","name":"Kirtan","id":18868},{"urlkey":"devotional-singing","name":"Devotional Singing","id":21450},{"urlkey":"spiritual-awakening","name":"Spiritual Awakening","id":69583},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670},{"urlkey":"meditation-and-chanting","name":"Meditation and Chanting","id":82258},{"urlkey":"ananda-marga","name":"Ananda Marga","id":89311},{"urlkey":"vegetarians-and-vegans-vegan-vegetarian-activism","name":"Vegetarian and Vegan Activism","id":136597}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Flushing-Ananda-Marga-Meditation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><span>This Meetup provides a venue and scope to experience mantra chanting, learn and practice meditation, and other yogic practices of Ananda Marga.

Experienced yoga and meditation teachers of Ananda Marga participate and guide those interested in learning meditation and answer questions on spiritual topics.<\/p>","lon":-73.8199996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/b\/highres_446731515.jpeg","photo_id":446731515,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/b\/600_446731515.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/1\/b\/thumb_446731515.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":120287622,"name":"Acarya Diiptimanananda Avadhuta","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/0\/3\/highres_251678403.jpeg","photo_id":251678403,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/0\/3\/member_251678403.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/0\/3\/thumb_251678403.jpeg"}},"members":13,"name":"Flushing Ananda Marga Meditation Meetup","id":19154834,"state":"NY","urlname":"Flushing-Ananda-Marga-Meditation-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448505431000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"blogs","name":"Blogging","id":44508}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Blog-writing\/","rating":4.87,"description":"<p><i>\"Writers write while dreamers procrastinate.\" &nbsp;(Besa Kosova)<\/i><\/p>\n<p>This meet-up was formed to <b>help its member stay on the wagon and make blogging way of life<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>We meet once a month, and spend the time in our meetings to discuss writing in general and blogging in particular:&nbsp;&nbsp;writing style, tone, authority,&nbsp;grammar&nbsp;etc. We will also dedicate a lion share of our meetings' time to read and review&nbsp;each others posts and provide constructive feedback.

Events are limited to 4 photographers. Most models seem to prefer 3 photographers. Those events with more than 4 are called paparazzi shoot-outs, they typically cost less. Some events are meet and greets or promotional events.<\/p>\n<p>The models chosen to be on the team have been interviewed and have passed a series of criteria to participate. These models are professional and work well beyond the time behind the camera: They scout locations, contact venues, determine if permits are required or not and obtain them if feasible. Some events require they rent wardrobe or equipment and it doesn't need to be explained that there is a great deal of time doing all of that. This group nor the models do any TFPs... Ever. What's nice is the photographers never have to spend any time editing, copying or distributing pictures to models. That's right. Photographers are not obligated to share their pictures nor are the models expecting any from them. WorldChoiceModels is ideal for:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers that want to do street photography or photowalks with a model. \u2022 Photographers looking to practice their skills, experiment with their equipment or technique.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Photographers looking to expand their portfolios. bridal, senior portraits, couples, fashion, commercial lifestyle, editorial, etc. From time to time there will be workshops on studio lighting, and specific genres.

This group is great for parents who have enough energy reserved to be available for children in addition to their own. Whether it is once a week or more that you do exchanges, this group WILL allow you to save on babysitters and expensive child care cost within a supportive network of families that also provides opportunity to nurture, love and teach each others children. We are parents ourselves and that experience alone can be so significant in having peace on who we are leaving our children with when we do exchanges. We invite all exchangers to meetup at some of the fun, free and low cost events posted in this group when exchanging. This group is founded on the principle that it takes a village to raise our children. In order to participate you mainly need to have enough energy and time reserved to care for children in addition to your own in a loving, safe manner. Homeschool parents, Single parents, Married parents, Foster parents, Aunties and Uncles raising neices and nephews, Grandparents raising grandchildren and more lets greet eachother, meet-up, get to know one another in this co-op to save on day and night care! Share with family, friends and neighbors. The bigger our network is the more resources we have for our families to swap with and even for backup care. &lt;br&gt;Please note that you should be willing to share who you are, your lifestyle, background and personal info as appropriate with the families that you are exchanging babysitting with. We all want to trust, know and feel safe with who are children are left with during an exchange. Discuss who your child is and any rules you want to take place while you are exchanging. Tips and advice will be posted in the group for help on how to safely do exchanges. This group and it's founder are not responsible or liable for any injury, accidents or harm done to your child\/children. You MUST get to thoroughly know the familes you are doing exchanges with!

This is a music group with performances by live vocal groups, bands, solo artists and other music based art, in rare cases of DJs spinning on a turntable. The music can range from R and B, Pop, Rock and Roll, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Reggae, Calypso, Soca, Merengue, Afro-Cuban, Reggaeton and anything else in between. Some events are local in New York City and New Jersey with dinner while others are day trip events with buses commuting from the five boroughs to dinner halls then concerts halls. Some live artist who participate are well known and others are up and coming. Some are events with 70's, 80's or 90's themes while others presenting the current styles of music. Some are live shows with artist and other are dancing events. These are usually free or low cost events that are sponsored by The Making A Difference with Morinda Organization which focuses on charity, health and fitness. So some events may include a short sponsorship presentation or venue advertisement of maintaining and living in better health from a sponsor representative for 30 minutes prior to a show. Either way this is your ticket to fun and enjoyment with great people and great music.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7057333,"name":"Howard Spence","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/f\/8\/highres_209643832.jpeg","photo_id":209643832,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/f\/8\/member_209643832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/f\/8\/thumb_209643832.jpeg"}},"members":62,"name":"New York \/ New Jersey Live Music Meetup Group","id":19172583,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-New-Jersey-Live-Music-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"fine arts\/culture","id":1,"shortname":"arts-culture"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Real Music Lover"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1448999195000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"healing-circle","name":"Healing Circle","id":16650},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"reiki-holistic-healing","name":"Reiki, Holistic Healing","id":17740},{"urlkey":"reiki-share","name":"Reiki Share","id":20779},{"urlkey":"mind-body-connection","name":"Mind Body Connection","id":31781},{"urlkey":"awakening-thethird-eye","name":"Awakening the Third Eye","id":71740},{"urlkey":"violet-flame","name":"Violet Flame","id":89451}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/reneeli\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>I can't wait to meet you and work with you on your unique spiritual journey!&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>I am offering various events in the coming months including, healing circles, third eye activations from the Cosmic Christ, a holistic fair in midtown manhattan, plus opportunities for you to deepen your intuition and connect with your \"I AM\".<\/p> \n<p>Let's get rising to\" I AM\" CONSCIOUSNESS and transcend duality! &lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>More info on me, Renee Li at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.OmWisdomAndWellness.com\">www.OmWisdomAndWellness.com<\/a><\/p> \n<p>Connect with me on Facebook at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/DivineTruthSeekers\/events\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/DivineTruthSeekers\/events\/<\/a><\/p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;<\/p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/3\/4\/highres_444686164.jpeg","photo_id":444686164,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/3\/4\/600_444686164.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/3\/4\/thumb_444686164.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":119020162,"name":"Renee Li","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/4\/4\/highres_251807172.jpeg","photo_id":251807172,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/4\/4\/member_251807172.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/8\/4\/4\/thumb_251807172.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Healers' Hangout\/Cosmic Christ ThirdEye Activation","id":19172641,"state":"NY","urlname":"reneeli","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Truth Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449001186000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"book-club-movies","name":"Book Club, Movies","id":19594},{"urlkey":"critique-group","name":"Critique Group","id":34868},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966},{"urlkey":"reading-discussion","name":"Reading & Discussion","id":41530},{"urlkey":"book-club-book-swap","name":"book club\/book swap","id":680892}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Good-Book-Hunting\/","rating":4.78,"description":"<p>This Meetup is for those who love to read fiction novels and are looking for a book discussion group in NYC.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be meeting up about once a month to share our thoughts about a particular book.

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" By helping other members grow their business those same members will in turn help you grow your business. In 2014 BNI members passed 6.6 million referrals that generated an amazing $8.6 billion worth of closed business. Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 20+ (and counting) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, tech, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. We have power teams that can take you and your business to that next level. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 20+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Tuesdays at 7:00AM at Junior's) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?! Current Location: Junior's 386 Flatbush Ave Ext Brooklyn, NY 11201 Cost: $20\/visitor The meeting starts at 7:00am and is officially over at 8:30am. You will need to bring 50+ business cards to pass to everyone in the room. You will also need to be prepared to tell the room who you are, what you do, and who a perfect referral for you would be. The more specific you are in asking for the referral the greater chance you have in receiving that life changing referral on the spot.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/highres_444800198.jpeg","photo_id":444800198,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/600_444800198.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/e\/6\/thumb_444800198.jpeg"},"join_mode":"closed","members":15,"name":"BNI Revenue Raisers, Brooklyn NY","id":19173196,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Revenue-Raisers-Brooklyn-NY","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449036248000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"interracial","name":"Interracial Families","id":1861},{"urlkey":"food-tasting","name":"Food Tasting","id":17132},{"urlkey":"brunch","name":"Brunch","id":18239},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"kid-friendly-activities","name":"Kid Friendly Activities","id":26453},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"home-cooking","name":"Home Cooking","id":32289},{"urlkey":"cooking-at-home","name":"Cooking at Home","id":73417},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Umi-Family\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We'll be holding regular community potlucks celebrating culinary entrepreneurship mainly in the Brooklyn community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Umi is a platform for culinary entrepreneurship and a marketplace for home cooking.

Setting intentions with a group is a powerful practice because it allows your dreams and longings to be witnessed and supported by others. It also holds you accountable to taking the necessary action, internally and externally, to manifest your longings. While every circle has a different theme, there in always meditation, group sharing (optional), and the writing and speaking of individual intentions. Circles may also incorporate aspects of spiritual ceremony and ritual; however, it is not religious and open to women of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths.

Our meetup is $25.00 per person and there is limited space, so we are keeping it to a smaller group to begin with, but will move into a larger space as the meetup grows!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/highres_444776117.jpeg","photo_id":444776117,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/600_444776117.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/b\/3\/5\/thumb_444776117.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":66853322,"name":"Susana Vilmer","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/highres_251898005.jpeg","photo_id":251898005,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/member_251898005.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/6\/5\/5\/thumb_251898005.jpeg"}},"members":481,"name":"Women's Law of Attraction Self-Empowerment Meetup","id":19184494,"state":"NY","urlname":"womenlawofattraction","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Empowered Women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Rochelle","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449335102000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"moms-supporting-moms","name":"Moms Support","id":17140},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Book-Club-Moms-Westchester\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi there. I'm a new stay-at-home mom in the Westchester area looking to meet other moms with infants. I've always wanted to join a book club but it was tough while working full-time and even harder now with a baby. So why don't we try to get together after the holidays in early 2016 and start our own? Moms AND babies will be welcome (expecting moms too, of course!), and don't put too much pressure on yourself if you can't finish the assigned books. I'll try to pick some with Audible recordings (GREAT service to use while at home with a little one) and even movies so that those of us with limited time can still join in discussion. And hey, if you don't get to the book at all, that's ok -- this is about meeting other moms and their kids through a fun activity.<br><br>Our first meetup will be scheduled on a weekday -- If there's enough interest we can also start meeting over the weekends to make it easier on working moms.<br><\/p>","lon":-73.7900009155,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/highres_447718021.jpeg","photo_id":447718021,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/600_447718021.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/2\/a\/5\/thumb_447718021.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":75113672,"name":"Renee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/highres_251972308.jpeg","photo_id":251972308,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/member_251972308.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/e\/3\/4\/thumb_251972308.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Westchester Book Club for New Moms","id":19184531,"state":"NY","urlname":"Book-Club-Moms-Westchester","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Book Club Moms"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449351321000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"casino","name":"Casino Games","id":2965},{"urlkey":"shopping","name":"Shopping","id":9349},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"vacations","name":"Vacations","id":16746},{"urlkey":"cruising","name":"Cruises","id":19056},{"urlkey":"day-trips","name":"Day Trips","id":20423},{"urlkey":"tours","name":"Tours","id":20754},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"bus-trips","name":"Bus Trips","id":35476},{"urlkey":"historical-tours","name":"Historical Tours","id":73281}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Bus-Tours-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Our club will run&nbsp;<strong><em>BUS TRIPS<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; to fun and exciting places.&nbsp; Some of our meet-ups will be Shows, casinos, fairs, History trips, Flower shows, Lancaster Boston and other great places.&nbsp; The bus will leave from<\/p>\n<p>Bay Ridge Brooklyn and 34th and 6th Ave NYC<\/p>\n<p>We will also offer a stop if requested on AVE U and Coney Island AVE<\/p>\n<p>We will also plan meet-ups in Brooklyn and talk about future trips.<\/p>\n<p>This club will be a great way of meeting new people and friends&nbsp;that love to travel.<\/p>\n<p>The more members we get the more trips&nbsp; we will run.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/4\/8\/8\/highres_450209832.jpeg","photo_id":450209832,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/4\/8\/8\/600_450209832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/4\/8\/8\/thumb_450209832.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190568027,"name":"Philip Brown","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/highres_252019473.jpeg","photo_id":252019473,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/member_252019473.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/c\/1\/1\/thumb_252019473.jpeg"}},"members":265,"name":"Travel Friends Bus Tour Club","id":19185111,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Bus-Tours-Meetup","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Travelers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449362037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"bipolar","name":"Bipolar Disorder","id":892},{"urlkey":"life-management-systems-for-bipolar-disorder","name":"Life Management Systems for Bipolar Disorder","id":21491},{"urlkey":"mental-illness-awareness","name":"Mental Illness Awareness","id":55711},{"urlkey":"bipolar-and-depression","name":"Bipolar and Depression","id":60508},{"urlkey":"bipolar-support-group","name":"Bipolar Support Group","id":115297},{"urlkey":"managing-bipolar","name":"managing bipolar","id":156356},{"urlkey":"bipolar-group","name":"Bipolar Group","id":768272}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mental-Health-Mystics\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Who says that our thoughts are out of line?

I myself often lack the focus, energy, time and motivation to cook healthy, wholesome meals, even though I have tons of cookbooks and know how to. Being single can do that to you, and it's not good for my waistline or my budget. We can meetup at my place (I have a large dining room and kitchen) and divide whatever meals people bring into tupperwares, taking home nice portions to eat through-out the week. One of the main reasons I don't like cooking as a single woman is leftovers... I'm not a fan... so this kind of takes care of that problem. Instead of eating the same meal 7 nights in a row, we can have 7 or more people come and eat a different meal each night of the week! My apartment has a very spacious living room, dining room and kitchen. It's best we prepare food at our own places, but if needed, we can do some meal prep at my place too. I have a slow cooker, rice cooker, deep fryer and every other cooking gadget imaginable. I'm no longer a vegetarian, so I'm open to meals of any kind. Healthy is nice though. Casseroles and one pot meals are great. We'll balance it out when we see what people plan to bring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe we can kick back and have a few drinks too. I have a nice big patio\/2nd flr.

training and admonition of The Lord. I started this group to establish a gathering that caters to raising godly children. It is so important for us to learn, teach, and demonstrate virtues (moral excellence) to our little ones. Meet-ups involve one or more of the following: &nbsp;prayer, bible reading\/teaching, goal-setting for our children,&nbsp;teaching colors, numbers, ABC's, teaching textures, shapes, and sizes, scripture memory, outdoor exploring, learning through nature, arts and crafts, health and fitness introduction, library meet-ups, discussions. My hope is to unite people committed to raising godly children, and for us to all grow as we seek direction from God. Let us get together and see what the Lord has in store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are especially welcome to this group if you have realized that parenting is more than you can handle on your own. &nbsp;You are especially welcome to this group If you have some relational issues that have not been resolved and you know it is affecting your parenting. &nbsp;You are especially welcome if you don't know where you stand with God. &nbsp;Everyone is in a different place in life and God knows it already. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There will be many resources shared during our meet-ups to coach us and help us along the parenting journey. &nbsp;So come on in and stay awhile.<\/p>","lon":-73.8899993896,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":28693232,"name":"Elle","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/highres_251998184.jpeg","photo_id":251998184,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/member_251998184.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/3\/4\/8\/thumb_251998184.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Raising Children to Love The Lord and Love People He Created","id":19197308,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yonkers-Christian-Kids-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Everyone"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1449673014000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"private-lending","name":"Private Lending","id":30026},{"urlkey":"private-money-lending","name":"Private Money Lending","id":154505},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-lending","name":"Peer-to-Peer Lending","id":298291},{"urlkey":"sharing-economy","name":"sharing economy","id":918902},{"urlkey":"peer-to-peer-economy","name":"Peer to Peer Economy","id":1173472},{"urlkey":"online-lending","name":"Online lending","id":1506119}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/P2P-and-Marketplace-Lending-Operators\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>* Who should join: People with general interest in p2p and marketplace lending should join.

Few members that we have, often describe that the relationships forged in this group are often deep and rich.

Sometimes a simple thank-you can make the effort worthwhile.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d love for you to host an event, too! If you would like to host an event, please contact us to indicate that you are interested in becoming an event organizer of the group.

We are committed to ending patriarchy, not in achieving \u201cequality\u201d within patriarchy. We are committed to the liberation of all women, of all races and ethnicities, globally, and do not support causes that seek to benefit only white women.<\/p>\n<p>The establishment of this MeetUp group as a women-only space ensures that women in our organization have a liberatory space to work, organize, and bond, free from the negative impact of men.

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in New York. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have.

That was the same summer the Trayvon Martin verdict was announced. I felt hopeless, emotional and unable to advocate and defend my people because at that time, I was carrying my daughter and it was too risky to participate in the national protest and demonstrations that were taking place across the country.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I had to change my \"activism\" strategy.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>During the following summer, Michael Brown was gunned down with his hands in the air...my daughter was an infant.

Sadly, our previous organizer shut it down on New Year's Day 2016 (despite a stated intention not to do so), thereby wiping out all files, studies, reports, photos, discussions, e-lists, event history... and the entire institutional memory of the group. This represented the collective product of many feminists over a number of years. <br><\/p>\n<p>This valuable resource was created for the benefit of, and was open to, the entire Feminist community, members and non-members alike. It will take some time, but we will rebuild both the site and the collective inclusive spirit of the group. Silence in not an option. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please be a feminist or open to feminism if you join<\/b>. There are plenty of other groups to join if you are neither. Beyond that, we welcome feminists of all stripes, colors, creeds, and gender identities who are committed to challenging, confronting, and ultimately dismantling Patriarchy. Together we hope to forge a path to sexual equality and gender justice for all, not just by talking among ourselves, but by speaking out, writing, marching, demonstrating, protesting and actively projecting a loud and fierce voice in opposition to Rape Culture and the War on Women. <br><\/p>\n<p>Male supremacy must end. Oppression and violence are not natural or inevitable. Neither is patriarchy or any collection of interlocking\/intersecting systems of oppression. Radical Feminism, in the truest sense of the word 'Radical', is about going to the root of the systems of oppression that we all participate in and perpetuate, creating change from the ground up and making the world a better,&nbsp; more equitable, non-oppressive place. <br><\/p>\n<p>We believe change is possible and above all necessary.

Everywhere I Network I see that real need of introducing the two realms.  i.e. The Dentist to meet a CPA not to sell to each other but to introduce each others Clients to each other.  I know it may seem obvious to you but it is not in real life.  The Dentist sees many people that need their Taxes done and the CPA meets many people that might complain about a tooth ache.

We are currently in the process of starting an Event Planning Expo business and we are currently seeking independent event planning businesses who will be willing to vendor for us. Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo. Thank You for your time and we hope to see you at our meet ups!<\/p> \n<p>Thank You for your time and we look forward to getting to know each and every one of you and hopefully have an opportunity to work with you all!<\/p>","lon":-73.5599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/highres_447715221.jpeg","photo_id":447715221,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/600_447715221.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/thumb_447715221.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":144484202,"name":"Keith","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/highres_252392635.jpeg","photo_id":252392635,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/member_252392635.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/thumb_252392635.jpeg"}},"members":40,"name":"\"Vend & Attend\" - Long Island Event Planning","id":19245990,"state":"NY","urlname":"Vend-Attend-Long-Island-Event-Planning","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Event Planners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451321707000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"beginners-running","name":"Beginner's Running","id":24325},{"urlkey":"training-for-fun-runs","name":"Training For Fun Runs","id":32720},{"urlkey":"womens-running","name":"Women's Running","id":37072},{"urlkey":"beginning-running","name":"Beginning Running","id":58293},{"urlkey":"running-trail-walking","name":"Running & Trail Walking","id":68914},{"urlkey":"running-beginning-train-for-a-marathon","name":"Running: Beginning Train for a Marathon","id":82464},{"urlkey":"running-with-friends","name":"Running with Friends","id":92083},{"urlkey":"beginner-runners","name":"Beginner Runners","id":104066},{"urlkey":"beginner-running","name":"Beginner Running","id":158408}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosedale-Beginning-Running-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"\u201cThis is a group for anyone interested in beginning running, beginning speed walking, etc. All beginners welcome.

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo.

The bible is for everyone and everyone who studies it can master its message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bible study is open all.&nbsp; It will help you to have a better life, a deeper understanding of your purpose and a greater knowledge of just how important your life really is.&nbsp;Bible study is also a great&nbsp;opportunity to fellowship with like believers. Sharing with both new and mature believers is an opportunity to encourage each other to stay on track with our God-given assignments. <\/p>","lon":-73.9000015259,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/a\/highres_445481386.jpeg","photo_id":445481386,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/a\/600_445481386.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/a\/thumb_445481386.jpeg"},"join_mode":"closed","members":1,"name":"Bible Study Meetup","id":19252403,"state":"NY","urlname":"seasonal-times-ministries","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Christian(s)"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bronx","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451493068000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"bornagain","name":"Born Again Christian","id":602},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-marriage-minded","name":"Christian Singles Marriage Minded","id":15378},{"urlkey":"christian-singles","name":"Christian Singles","id":16271},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589},{"urlkey":"christian-dating","name":"Christian Dating","id":28647},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"eventos","name":"Eventos","id":58783},{"urlkey":"christian-dating-and-relationships","name":"Christian Dating and Relationships","id":72415},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613},{"urlkey":"christian-singles-and-singles-again","name":"Christian Singles and Singles Again","id":103825}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LoveDivineNYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>A place for Christian singles to meet other like minded singles, be encouraged in this season &amp; simply have a great time!<\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/e\/f\/highres_445481455.jpeg","photo_id":445481455,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/e\/f\/600_445481455.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/e\/f\/thumb_445481455.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":196931007,"name":"Ana V.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/7\/e\/highres_254579006.jpeg","photo_id":254579006,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/7\/e\/member_254579006.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/6\/7\/e\/thumb_254579006.jpeg"}},"members":84,"name":"Love Divine","id":19252498,"state":"NY","urlname":"LoveDivineNYC","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.8499984741,"who":"Love Divine NYC"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451494965000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"collaboration-between-creative-minds","name":"Collaboration between Creative Minds","id":29526}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jason-tests-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We will test things.

Understand and learn from owners who have experienced similar issues through business cycles from startup struggles to the relative utopia of predictable success.

These are RPGs, CCGs, or Table Top sessions that are going to be completed the same day that they begin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tournaments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(Only 30 active registrations allowed per tournament!)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tournaments are going to be Campaigns and Sessions where players are ranked and a prize is going to be given to the winning players.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>The current registration cost for Campaigns, Flash Sessions, and Tournaments&nbsp;is free.&nbsp; You need to register any character, deck,&nbsp;or army with an official Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top Dungeon Master though.&nbsp; All characters need to be&nbsp;produced and rolled in front of an official group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; All decks need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All armies need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; This is to ensure that characters and stats are not&nbsp;altered and that characters are&nbsp;using their actual rolled stats and not illegally inflated stats.&nbsp; <strong><em>When the group has more members than space to play, there is going to be a cost of $10.00 a character, $10.00 a deck,&nbsp;and $15.00 an army for registration.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; Every group member gets to register 3 characters and&nbsp;1 army for free.&nbsp; You do not have to pay for sessions as long as you are using a registered character, or army, that has not died.&nbsp; Characters can not be reused or reregistered after they die.&nbsp; Armies and decks can be reused, but need to be reregistered and renamed, after they are defeated in battle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Usually, we are going to give at least 3 months notice prior to beginning any campaign.&nbsp; You need to register for the campaign via meetup. If you are absent from a session during a campaign, you either are given a loss for that battle, or your character is said to be in a limbo and remains in place until you return.&nbsp; If you do not return for 3 Meetups in&nbsp;a row, your character dies.&nbsp; You are not allowed to reuse a dead character.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><strong>REGISTRION COST:<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Characters:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE&nbsp; (There is currently no cost for registering&nbsp;Characters with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Armies:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Armies&nbsp;with this group.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decks:<\/strong>&nbsp; FREE (There is currently no cost for registering Decks with this group.)<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Thank you,<\/p>\n<p>Erik<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/highres_445811825.jpeg","photo_id":445811825,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/600_445811825.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/e\/3\/1\/thumb_445811825.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":197771903,"name":"Erik","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/highres_252697901.jpeg","photo_id":252697901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/member_252697901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/0\/d\/thumb_252697901.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"The Manhattan RPG, CCG, and Table Top group!","id":19296737,"state":"NY","urlname":"rpgclub","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1452192657000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"locals-new-in-town","name":"Locals & New in Town","id":21129},{"urlkey":"womens-networking","name":"Women's Networking","id":43484}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-to-New-York-time-to-connect-with-great-women\/","rating":0,"description":"I'm new to New York City and am eager to meet some wonderful women who want to explore Manhattan, etc with like women.

I\u2019ve always had fairly good self-esteem and confidence about my body and myself- and wanted the same for others. Of course we\u2019re not going to feel great about ourselves 24\/7, but I want to help more people feel happy, healthy, to love and accept themselves, and to realize how incredible they are. For a long time, I had a narrow view of what it meant to have positive body image- mostly dictated by what society said we should judge ourselves by: a specific beauty ideal, weight, what people thought, and by what we were eating. Throughout my personal evolution, I have learned to grow exponentially stronger in the love for my body and discovered this emerging body positive culture. What initially ignited my fire and determination to add to this important conversation about positive body image is the many women I started to meet post high school struggling with serious body image issues, and although I have not personally suffered, their experiences touched me greatly. What matters to me, and what I want to spread throughout my life- be it with the weights classes, Zumba classes, BollyX classes I teach or Meetups I run- is the importance of inner health -to prevent against disease etc- and that our weight and appearance does not determine our beauty nor worth. I'm clear that loving ourselves and our bodies is the best path to take- not negative self-talk or hate. I want to create a community where women can come and talk about a healthy body image and see themselves in a positive, loving light. Join me and let's talk about what it means for you!

My wounds were speaking louder than my heart, they began to show me how unhappy I was. Fast forward five years to today. Today I travel and teach throughout North America sharing with women Soul Therapy Seminars and a Journey to Self Love, a two day emotionally empowering discovery of learning how to love yourself, honestly, courageously and with joy. I know you have been yearning to share with a group of women who have your back, seeking support from others who can understand your own journey, acknowledging your pain while uplifting you to greater new heights of self awareness. You've been ready for a long time now, searching and seeking your own journey to self love. I've been there, let me help guide you along the way so that you can get there with the support that you need to accelerate your life to one of freedom and inner peace.

She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. <b>- Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me.<b>-<\/b><b>Alexandra B., NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>*** <\/b>If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before.

Presenters prepare a 6 minute educational presentation and engage in 20 minutes of feedback and questioning after they present. Entrepreneurs gain insight into possible ways they can improve their businesses, gather real-time feedback, connect with a community that truly cares about their progress, and walk away feeling like they have advanced their business. The audience also learns a great deal from the presentations.
