We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

In hipster Williamsburg, a world onto itself where no one over 30 years old is allowed to live according to law, we\u2019ll spend most of the time walking along the Waterfront, visit a State Park and hopefully the Brooklyn Bowl. (2013's Academy Award winning short film, \u201cCurfew\u201d by Shawn Christensen, was filmed at the Bowl and can be inexpensively downloaded. You want the short not the full length version shown in the movies. It is truly great.). There will definitely be many surprises along the way. <b><i>We will meet BEFORE 1:00 P.M. Be ready to go.

Only a few of the many hikes and walks that are offered by AMC leaders are posted on Meetup.

AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, see Accuweather like I do, I will post a notice Saturday morning on the day of the hike by 10:00 A.M.

The exhibition, the artist\u2019s first at James Cohan<\/p> <p><br\/>In his work as a filmmaker, Omer Fast defines a new relationship between reality and\u00a0fiction. He is interested in exploring the construction of narratives, in particular how\u00a0stories change when told from different perspectives. The works in the exhibition\u00a0each examine the shifting boundaries of modern conflict through the personal stories\u00a0of those involved. Fast borrows from traditions of documentary, dramatization and\u00a0fantasy, manipulating time through the use of repetition, looping, and reenactment to\u00a0create new and complex structures. All three works use human emotions as stand-ins\u00a0for the larger socio-political reality of contemporary warfare.<\/p> <p>3RD STOP: \u00a0MITCHELL-INNES &amp; NASH (534 W 26TH ST) PRESENTS: SARAH BRAMAN, YOU ARE EVERYTHING<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/b\/5\/600_448162453.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Braman is known for her large-scale sculptures in which parts of scrapyard vehicles and old furniture are combined with translucent volumes of color and light.\u00a0 The artist\u2019s distinctive color palette of rich pinks, blues and purples permeates the exhibition, from spray paint on found objects and hand-dyed fabric to the expansive colors of the glass forms.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>For her most recent series, Braman uses scavenged objects from domestic life, such as discarded bunk bed, a truck cap, assorted furniture, as a starting point. Their visible wear-and-tear speaks to the passage of time and recalls the everyday struggles and joys to which these objects bore witness. Braman turns the utility of these objects on their head, destabilizing the notions of home and family.<\/p> <p>In contrast, the glass forms to which these objects are attached appear otherworldly. Placed at off-kilter angles throughout the exhibition space, the sunset colored blocks generate a light and shadow that quietly uproot these broken down memorials.<\/p> <p>4th STOP: ROBERT MILLER GALLERY (524 W 26TH ST) PRESENTS: PATTI SMITH, EIGHTEEN STATIONS<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/4\/600_448201204.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Eighteen Stations\u00a0revolves around the world of\u00a0M Train, Smith\u2019s bestselling book released in 2015.\u00a0M Train\u00a0chronicles, as Smith describes, \u201ca roadmap to my life,\u201d as told from the seats of the caf\u00e9s and dwellings she has worked from globally. Reflecting the themes and sensibility of the book,\u00a0Eighteen Stations\u00a0is a meditation on the act of artistic creation. It features the artist\u2019s illustrative photographs that accompany the book\u2019s pages, along with works by Smith that speak to art and literature\u2019s potential to offer hope and consolation.

Gertrude Stein credited her auto mechanic with the \u201cLost Generation\u201d moniker and Ernest Hemingway made it stick in The\u00a0Sun Also Rises. While generally associated with writers, the \u201cLost Generation\u201d was all encompassing\u2014Americans who came of age during the First World War\u2014some of whom served in the war, all of whom were subject to its upheaval.<\/p> <p>6TH STOP: PACE GALLLERY (510 W 25TH ST) PRESENTS: QIU XIAOFEI, DOUBLE PENDULUM<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/c\/600_448202444.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Using acrylic paint, Qiu appropriates palette knives, spray guns, brushes and other implements in an improvisational manner; giving in to and resisting the resulting sprays, drips and even the creation of forms. The art, which leans towards abstraction, explores the potential of form plus colour, and thus expresses what the artist calls \u2018a social subconscious\u2019.<\/p> <p>\u2018There has been a kind of distant coolness in Chinese art, even when it refers to the West in style,\u2019 says Arne Glimcher, chairman of Pace Gallery in New York. \u2018Qiu Xiaofei\u2019s painting is unique in China and spearheads a new generation of Chinese abstraction. Although his personal references are encapsulated in expressionistic color and enigmatic symbols, they are uniquely Chinese.<\/p> <p>7TH STOP: YOSSI MILO (245 W 10TH AVE) PRESENT: CHRIS McCAW, DIRECT POSITIVE<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/0\/600_448202976.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Chris McCaw builds his own large-format cameras and outfits them with powerful lenses typically used for military surveillance and aerial reconnaissance. Instead of film, McCaw inserts expired fiber-based gelatin silver photo paper directly into the camera. Pointing the lens at the sun, McCaw makes recordings ranging from thirty seconds to as long as 36 hours. The sun, intensified by the lens, scorches its path across the paper while creating a solarized image of the landscape or seascape below \u2013 a \u201cdirect positive\u201d image made in-camera, without an intervening negative. These burned lines and holes are tangible traces of the act of making each photograph: marking time, recording location, mapping weather conditions and channeling light.<\/p> <p><br\/>8TH STOP: GLADSTONE (515 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: T.J. WILCOX, EQUIVALENTS<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/1\/8\/600_448203096.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The show will present new film installations and lenticular photographic lightboxes, exploring the movement and mutation of cloudscapes as compelling abstracted narratives.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this installation, Wilcox leads viewers to look upward to the ceiling, an often-overlooked surface within the gallery space. Suggestive of the natural world beyond the enclosed built environment and beyond human stature, the assembled projections offer a view of the extraordinary, unpredictable, and the everyday experience of gazing upward at the sky. The artist has produced sculptures that hang from the ceiling at a single point, comprising an arrangement of steel, Plexiglas and projected video. These hanging sculptures suspend in balance a group of projection screens arranged to float overhead like a cluster of abstracted clouds. The screens are made of a new material that allows rear-projected video to brightly appear in high resolution in any light condition. Wilcox\u2019s structures engender awe for the enormity and phenomena of the natural world that often goes unnoticed; non-linear narratives concerning the act of looking upward interspersed in the films additionally offer further reflection on the world above our heads.<\/p> <p>9TH STOP: ANDREA ROSEN (525 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: LIZZIE \u00a0FITCH AND RYAN TRECARTIN, INSTALLATIONS<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/c\/600_448203292.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Furthering their notion of \u201csculptural theaters\u201d\u2014installations built as containers for specific movies, whose architectural, audiovisual, and sculptural elements expand onscreen content into environmental panoramas\u2014the artists have transformed Andrea Rosen Gallery into a network of halls and chambers that plot a path for visitors through a sequence of new movies and ambient spaces.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The thematic language of these enclosures is lifted from lakeside Americana\u2014nature as retreat. One room is distinguished from a placeless labyrinth by the railing of a pontoon boat that snakes around its perimeter; another is floored with pine 2x4s resembling a dock. The movie looped in this room is projected beyond the edge of the planks, above a shallow drop into a carpeted void simulating water. Elsewhere, seating is carved from foam, tromp l\u2019oeil boulders. The entire space is bound together by an atmospheric composition of nature sounds largely produced by an online sound generator, instilling a kind of numbed, placid continuity.<\/p> <p>These rustic cues are a departure from generically slick, suburban merchandise shopped from international retailers, the likes of which the artists are best known for casting as furnishings for their installations. But the great outdoors is the jurisdiction of only another department in the same type of store, whose all-purpose ubiquity reflects the comfort cravings of the American psyche.<\/p> <p>10TH STOP: FREDERICKS &amp; FREISER (536 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: MARK THOMAS GIBSON, \u00a0SOME MONSTERS LOOM LARGE<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/c\/e\/600_448204046.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>11TH STOP: JACK SHAINMAN (524 W 24TH ST) PRESENTS: BARKLEY L HENDRICKS, NEW WORKS<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/3\/a\/600_448204154.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>his most political to date. Steeped in pop culture and balanced with exquisite detail, the cast of characters in Hendricks\u2019 work inhabits an unconventional realism united by painterly mastery.Hendricks culls subjects for his hagiographic portraits from sartorially minded friends and acquaintances he has encountered around the world, including travels to Jamaica, his hometown of Philadelphia, and Connecticut where Hendricks now lives and works.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>12TH STOP: SIKKEMA JENKINS (530 W 22ND ST) PRESENTS: KEIICHI TANAAMI, VISIBLE DARKNESS, INVISIBLE DARKNESS<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/2\/d\/9\/600_448204825.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Tanaami\u00a0came of age in post-war Japan and began his career in advertising. Finding the work artistically unfulfilling, he ventured into the burgeoning\u00a01960s\u00a0Japanese art scene and began making collages and films influenced by American mass culture, B movies, and a trip to New York where he visited Warhol\u2019s factory. He befriended artists from the Japanese anti-art movement Neo Dada Organizers while they were making their groundbreaking work. Like other Pop artists he was also inspired by eroticism, an impulse that eventually led him to become an editor of Playboy Japan in 1975.\u00a0Reflected in the new paintings featured in the exhibition is\u00a0Tanaami\u2019s\u00a0engagement with his contemporary artistic environment and continued\u00a0reimagining\u00a0of traditional Japanese iconography. Cherry blossoms,\u00a0Guzei\u00a0bridges and Buddha figures are featured alongside roosters and tigers, inspired by the work of Ito\u00a0Jakachu, an 18th century scroll painter.Tanaami, now in his 80s, is making his largest and most technically ambitious work to date. Unique to his practice in terms of scale, the new paintings are emblematic ofTanaami\u2019s\u00a0evolving career and myriad international influences.<\/p> <p>13TH STOP: PAULA COOPER GALLERY (521 W 21ST) PRESENTS: JENNIFER BARTLETT<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/6\/f\/600_448205487.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Known for monumental and conceptual multi-panel works composed of programmatic grids, Jennifer Bartlett negotiates an intersection between precise geometry and lyrical figuration. In the five diptychs on view, she expands her representational painting to engage the structural underpinnings of her natural surroundings. Houses, shorelines and marshes near her home in Amagansett or foliage, flowers and landscaped paths from her Brooklyn garden occupy her canvases. Based on Bartlett\u2019s original photographs, her compositions diverge to create a delicate discord within each diptych; the pairs of square panels juxtapose two images of the same scene but with shifting perspective, slight distortions of scale or altered perceptions. In\u00a0Rose\u00a0[masked]), the two compositions seem to simply contrast in spatial proximity, though further examination reveals a complex abstraction. As Bartlett describes: \u201cIt\u2019s a little like a stereopticon, only off-kilter.\u201d<\/p> <p><br\/>Painting with graining brushes, Bartlett builds layer upon layer to weave an expressionistic grid, a dense fabric rich with tactile complexity. Often used for decorative painting, a graining brush\u2019s multiple bristles groups are arranged equidistantly so that the painted gesture leaves a trail of parallel lines.<\/p> <p>14TH STOP: GLADSTONE GALLERY (530 W 21ST) PRESENTS: PHILLIPE PARRENO, IF THIS THEN ELSE <img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/1\/2\/600_448205138.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>a time based-exhibition and a conditional construct. Scripted events are automated by command lines executed within a computer: if a light goes off, then a film is screened and the temperature in the room changes; if the film finishes screening, then the lights are turned on\u2026<\/p> <p><br\/>Activities within the bioreactor control the overall scenario of the exhibition, although the computer writes and repeats the scripts with some variation. Inside the bioreactor, the microorganisms anticipate the rhythms, \u201cpredictable\u201d qualities, and dramaturgy of the exhibition environment. In return, the organisms can alter the conditions within the bioreactor and in the exhibition space outside of its habitat, revealing a basic relationship between time and living matter. When the microorganisms inside the bioreactor detect time-related variations, they can mutate or evolve in anticipation of future variations. Alternatively, they can remain passive and follow the transformations by adjusting their inner molecular clocks.<\/p> <p>15TH STOP: DAVID ZWIRNER GALLERY (525 W 19TH ST) PRESENTS, KARLA BLACK, NEW SCULPTURES <img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/a\/9\/600_448205545.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>sculptures made specifically for the space and completed on site.<\/p> <p><br\/>Combining traditional artistic materials such as chalk, paper, paint, and plaster with everyday items including eye shadow, earth, ribbon, toilet paper, and cotton wool, Black\u2019s works are at once elaborate and simple, expressive and restrained. They challenge their own medium by being \u201calmost\u201d or \u201conly just\u201d objects with a close affinity to painting, performance art, and installation. As the artist notes, the \u201cmost important thing about the work is that it prioritizes material experience over language as a way to learn about and understand the world.\u201d<\/p> <p>16TH STOP: MICHAEL ROSENDFELD [masked]TH AVE @ 19TH ST) PRESENTS: THEODORE ROSZAK, PROPULSIVE TRANSFIGURATION, A STUDY OF DRAWINGS[masked] <img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/6\/2\/c\/600_448205676.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Known more as a sculptor, with over 60 drawings on display, \u00a0these drawings\u00a0reveal his capacious intellect and expansive range of interests. The title of the exhibition alludes to Roszak\u2019s fascination with the dynamics of metamorphosis\u2014the transformative energies of the natural, organic world as well as the potential of technology and industry to alter the world, for better and for worse. A voracious consumer of ideas, Roszak found inspiration for his prolific body of work in a variety of sources. These included: the design and engineering innovation of streamlining that Norman Bel Geddes addressed in\u00a0Horizons; the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Otto Rank; French purism; atomic energy; aeronautics and space exploration; and the art and culture of India.<\/p> <p>Fee: $5.00 (payable via Venmo or cash to your guide Joey Israel, at start of tour)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Let's meet out front of PAUL KASMIN GALLERY, 293 W 190th Ave @ 27th St","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GuySocialNyc\/events\/229405193\/","yes_rsvp_count":28,"duration":14400000,"name":"GUY GALLERY WALK: MARCH EDITION","id":"229405193","time":1459011600000,"updated":1459033412000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1383018152000,"name":"GUY SOCIAL NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":10885132,"urlname":"GuySocialNyc","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"GUYS"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"330 7th Avenue","name":"The National Opera Center","lon":-73.993385,"id":22226972,"state":"NY","lat":40.747768,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":0.235552668571,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456976023000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a group audition and we will learn the parts of a song and combine parts as a group - you will be critiqued on how well you learn your part, how you sound individually, and how well you blend in with the group.

This seminar is intended to help develop the meetup participants in understanding programming concepts, the foundation of all programming languages today. With a solid grasp of programming concepts and with an understanding of how they are used within the context of one programming language, people can see these concepts being applied to other languages, and can begin to understand the ideas and intentions of code in other languages.<\/p> <p>It is important to understand that although a programing language is not being taught, that a programming language is needed to teach these concepts. The seminar will be taught around the PHP and JavaScript web programming and scripting languages and will be demonstrated using online tools to execute including PHP Fiddle (<a href=\"http:\/\/phpfiddle.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/phpfiddle.org\/<\/a>), JS Fiddle (<a href=\"https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/<\/a>), and various other appropriate fiddle programs in order to show examples in other languages.<\/p> <p>In the course of this session, the following will be covered.<\/p> <p>- Introduction: Explain the importance of learning concepts and how concepts are almost universal across programming languages.<\/p> <p>- Variables: Understanding the purpose and use of variables in programming<\/p> <p>- Simple Mathematical and Common Operations: Show basic mathematical operators and how they are used commonly in most languages.<\/p> <p>- Dev environment: Use of a dev environment to practice concepts.

Digging into the background of a killer named York, she uncovers wrenching truths that challenge familiar notions of victim and criminal, innocence and guilt, honor and corruption-ultimately revealing shocking secrets of her own.<\/p> <p>Beautiful and transcendent, The Enchanted reminds us of how our humanity connects us all, and how beauty and love exist even amidst the most nightmarish reality.\"<\/p> <p>The total voting from the poll and the January Meetup--<\/p> <p>The Enchanted by Rene Denfeld--11<\/p> <p>Tigerman by Nick Harkaway--6<\/p> <p>Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood--5<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Queens-Literati\/events\/228500103\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"March -- The Enchanted by Rene Denfeld","id":"228500103","time":1459011600000,"updated":1459105129000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1245713588000,"name":"The Queens Literati","group_lon":-73.8799972534,"id":1477759,"urlname":"The-Queens-Literati","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Humble Bookworms"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11205","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"317 Clermont Avenue #4","name":"Brooklyn Masonic Temple","lon":-73.969528,"id":16326512,"state":"NY","lat":40.688129,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.41623592377,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432702821000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>***<b>PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE NO BALLROOM WORKSHOP ON MARCH 26, 2016.\u00a0 PLEASE STAYED TUNED FOR INFORMATION REGARDING APRIL.***<\/b><\/p> <p>We the Authentic Steppers of Connecticut\/Bklyn have added another Sophisticated Partner Style Dance to our Chicago Style Steppin Classes.<\/p> <p><b>It is called Detroit Urban Style Ballroom!<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/5\/2\/6\/600_437953606.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Under the mentoring and Instruction of Master Ballroom Instructor from<\/b> \"<b>Charlotte Purple Steppers\" Demond Carter<\/b>, we will be bringing this fun . easy and Sophisticated Partner Style dance to the Tri-state area.<\/p> <p>We will have returning Instructor Demond Carter from Purple Charlotte Steppers, NC<\/p> <p>Location for this particular Workshop is: BROOKLYN MASONIC LODGE<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 317 Clermont Avenue<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brooklyn, N.Y.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2nd Floor, Room 2 North<\/p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1pm-3pm \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>There will be instruction in the Fundamental basics of the dance in a way that will get you moving and executing moves with comfort your very first class!<\/p> <p>For those with previous Ballroom Experience, this will give you the opportunity to increase your repetoire,\u00a0 and perfect mechanics.<\/p> <p>We recommend (but don't require) that women wear comfortable shoes with a slight heel and that the Gents wear leather soled shoes.<\/p> <p>$15pp<\/p> <p>No partner necessary<\/p> <p>This will be a monthly class until interest and attendance build and then we will meet more often.

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression.

We'll also be looking at some of the newer buildings including\u00a0a\u00a0salmon-colored stucco palazzo,\u00a0Mediterrean-style\u00a0palaces with red Spanish tiled roofs,\u00a0Afghan Mosque made partly of mable, Greek Orthodox Church with multiple round domes,\u00a0Korean Buddhist Temple made of wood, and\u00a0Russian Orthodox Church with an onion-shaped blue dome.<\/p> <p>The neighborhood of Malba doesn't have any commercial establishments, multi-family homes,\u00a0or public transportation; therefore,\u00a0people living in Malba usually travel around by automobile or boat\/yacht.\u00a0Some call Malba the \"Beverly Hills of the East Coast.\" We'll first look at some of the houses in Northern Flushing and then head to Whitestone, which has some lovely Victorian-era houses and new\u00a0churches. However, we'll have to walk (about 15 to 20\u00a0blocks)\u00a0through a mostly ordinary-looking\u00a0section of Whitestone\u00a0to get to an interesting section of\u00a0Whitestone and ritzy Malba.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk. This is for the organizer\u2019s Meetup preparation costs and fees.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Time\/Place:<\/b>\u00a0 The meeting time is <i>(after lunch)<\/i> <b>at 1:45 PM<\/b>. The meeting place is <b>outside of the entrance to McDonalds Restaurant\u00a0at[masked] Roosevelt Avenue (on the north side of the street between Main Street and Union Street)<\/b>.<\/p> <p><b>THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO MCDONALDS RESTAURANT IN FLUSHING. WE ARE MEETING AT THE MACDONALDS RESTAURANT ON ROOSEVELT AVENUE , NOT MAIN STREET.<\/b><\/p> <p>Before the walk, restrooms are available in Macy's Department Store, which is\u00a0directly across the street from McDonald's Restaurant. The restrooms in Macy's are located on the second floor, next to the Shoe\/Sneaker Department.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation by subway:<\/b> <b>Take the No. 7 subway train to Main Street, Flushing. This is the last stop on the No. 7 train subway.<\/b>\u00a0Allow extra time because this train makes local stops to Main Street, Flushing.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation by the LIRR:<\/b> You can also take the Long Island Railroad from Nassau County to Flushing, Queens\u00a0<b>OR<\/b> the Long Island Railroad from Penn Station in Manhattan to Flushing, Queens.

At that point, we'll be taking a bus, the Q 44\u00a0(which is\u00a0a NYC bus) back to Main Street\/39th Avenue\u00a0in Flushing.\u00a0The Q 44 bus has frequent service on Saturdays, running about every 8 or 9 minutes.<\/p> <p>Because the Q 44 is a select bus service (SBS), passengers will have to pay the fare at a machine (which is at the bus stop) before boarding the bus and then get a receipt of payment from the machine. Paying the fare this way speeds up the boarding process. You can also buy a Metrocard at another machine located at this bus stop.<\/p> <p>The bus ride from 14th Avenue\/Parsons Boulevard to Main Street, Flushing takes about 14 minutes. You can then use the Metrocard to transfer from the city bus\u00a0\u00a0to the subway (No. 7 train). This is only\u00a0one fare.<\/p> <p>Rainy\/snowy weather or\u00a0cold\/windy conditions will\u00a0cancel this walk.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly.

Many techniques used in Ju Jiitsu are purely technical, requiring barely any strength, and can be used to triumph over much stronger opponents. This self defense course is designed to make you more aware, prepared, and ready for any situation that may occur in your everyday life. Although hopefully you will never be in a situation where you must use these tactics, we hope this course provides helpful tips that are simple, effective and easy to use. Net proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to further the programs of the New York Asian Women's Center. The New York Asian Women\u2019s Center helps women and their children overcome domestic violence and other forms of abuse by empowering them to govern their own lives. The Center provides a safe haven through multi-lingual support programs and shelter services. In addition, the Center works to raise public awareness about violence against women, advocates for the rights of survivors, and acts as an agent of social change. Thanks to Ana Lowry and Unity Jiu Jitsu school in New York for providing the space, time, and instruction to teach us how to protect ourselves in unexpected situations.<\/p> <p>FAQs:<\/p> <p>What should I wear to the event?

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/2\/2\/0\/600_447205120.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BuddhistInsights\/events\/229720036\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"ROCKAWAY BEACH, NYC: 3pm Meditation with Bhante Suddh\u0101so & Bhante Saddhasara","id":"kbvvqlyvfbjc","time":1459018800000,"updated":1459029684000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454726458000,"name":"Buddhist Insights","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":19520416,"urlname":"BuddhistInsights","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07023","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Fanwood","address_1":"257 Midway Avenue","name":"Dhammakaya Mediation Center","lon":-74.39093,"id":12796962,"state":"NJ","lat":40.645134,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.2624187469,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457634663000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are invited to join the next meetup.Our meditation meetups are conducted by Dhammakaya meditation instructors, and practitioners who have committed their lives by ordaining to teach meditation and Dhamma(reality of life).

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we must be out of the gym no later than 8:00pm.

Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds.\u00a0<\/p> <p>6. Usually each team has 1-2 subs. Subs should enter mid-game (one of the teams reaches 6 points) and should start the following game.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages. Bhante Saddhasara speaks fluent English and very much enjoys the back and forth of his conversations with Americans.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group\/events\/226150760\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":9000000,"name":"Join Us for Guided Meditation and Discussion with Bhante Saddhasara!","id":"cltxklyvfbjc","time":1459029600000,"updated":1459041087000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1442935315000,"name":"Manhattan Buddhist Meditation Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18957225,"urlname":"Manhattan-Buddhist-Meditation-Group","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":" Merrick","address_1":"1960 Bayberry Ave","name":"Anchor Down: Seafood Bar & Grill","lon":-73.539482,"id":24194702,"state":"NY","lat":40.643467,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":24.7719306946,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458421896000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anchordownny.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anchordownny.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.anchordownny.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>There is street parking available.<\/p> <p>The seafood is fresh and delish!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will start by meeting at the bar area 15 minutes before we are seated","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CRUSTACEAN-NATION-LONG-ISLAND\/events\/229719495\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Meet and enjoy delicious seafood !!","id":"229719495","time":1459029600000,"updated":1459046810000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1458418596000,"name":"Crustacean Nation","group_lon":-73.6399993896,"id":19731247,"urlname":"CRUSTACEAN-NATION-LONG-ISLAND","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Seafood lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11101","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Astoria","address_1":"35th Avenue at 37th Street","name":"Museum of the Moving Image","lon":-73.923698,"id":1528033,"state":"NY","lat":40.755882,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.50103640556,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457995147000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/c\/1\/600_447860929.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/c\/b\/600_447860939.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Messiah of Evil:<\/p> <p>This enigmatic, artsy horror film from the early 1970's is a lost classic waiting to be rediscovered. The dreamlike storyline echoes elements of Night Of The Living Dead and Carnival Of Souls but manages to chart a surrealistic course all its own, carefully weaving shocks into its hazy mood to build a very personalized sort of nightmare feel. Marianna Hill and Michael Greer offer subtle, nicely stylized performances, both slowly sliding from self-possessed cool into numb fear in a believable style. There are also effective character turns by Elisha Cook, Jr. as a drunk whose ramblings serve as an early warning of the horrors to come and Bennie Robinson's supremely unnerving turn as an otherworldly agent of the evil that infects the film's small-town setting. However, the most distinctive aspect of Messiah Of Evil is its striking visual design: Jack Fisk's production design is dazzling, with the nightmarish pop-art look of the artist's home being the highlight of his work here, and Stephen Katz's crisp widescreen lensing effectively deploys the kind of eerie, primary-colored lighting that genre fans usually associate with Italian horror films. First-time director Willard Huyck (better known for writing scripts for George Lucas with co-writer Gloria Katz) does a fine job of mixing all these distinctive to create a uniquely Californian variant on its gothic horror inspirations. In short, Messiah Of Evil is a macabre little gem and a must for any fan of 1970's horror.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nDarktown Strutters:<\/p> <p>New World Pictures released some unusual films in an attempt to corner the exploitation market's whims during its history - but Darktown Strutters definitely takes the cake. George Armitage's script mixes barbed social commentary, slapstick comedy, action and free-form craziness to create a thoroughly unpredictable storyline. Director William Witney has fun with the material, getting the most out of some bizarre Jack Fisk-designed sets and maintaining a machine-gun pace to keep up with story's manic, unpredictable style. Trina Parks makes a suitably statuesque heroine and shows some nice comic timing while Roger Mosley lends nice support as the gang leader who acts as her second banana. There's also a scene-stealing turn from Norman Bartold as the Colonel Sanders-styled villain. The resulting film may be too frenetic and odd for a lot of viewers but exploitation film fans who can tune in to its odd wavelength will find Darktown Strutters to be a fast-paced and highly original slab of b-movie ephemera.<\/p> <p><br\/>A tough biker gang comprised of African-American women heads off to find a member's mother and her abductor in this exploitation comedy ostensibly designed to make fun of racial stereotypes.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36nKCu1CkJ0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=36nKCu1CkJ0<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Oi3TKozz7EY\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Oi3TKozz7EY<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/229592759\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Messiah of Evil & Darktown Strutters 35mm film prints movie starts at 7pm","id":"229592759","time":1459031400000,"updated":1459068607000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"157 West, 47th Street","name":"Maple Lounge (Aspen Social Club)","lon":-73.983704,"id":23567504,"state":"NY","lat":40.759079,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.709961950779,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455584557000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\u00a0 Come &amp; Play Holi With Real Colors<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/6\/3\/1\/600_446426161.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/holi-bollywood-dance-party-play-with-real-colors-tickets-20967829342\">Buy Tickets Here<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Time for Masti and some fun too\u2026 Time for us to look forward to some\u00a0HOLI Bash with\u00a0Real Holi Colors\u00a0with YOU.<\/p> <p>Come and make our\u00a0Bash\u00a0a real\u00a0Splash.<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/holi-bollywood-dance-party-play-with-real-colors-tickets-20967829342\">Buy Tickets Here<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Featuring\u00a0DJ Dyn Amite\u00a0from Yuva\u00a0 playing the latest\/80s\/90s and requests<\/b><\/p> <p>Join\u00a0in for the spectacular\u00a0festival of Colors!<\/p> <p><b>Dry Colored powder will be provided to play Holi the real way.There is no dress code.

Our timeless songs written in Germany in the 20s and 30s about love, war, peace, gay rights, and women's rights are more trenchant than ever. Hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>From their recent press release:<\/b><\/p> <p>\"[...]On Saturday, March 26, international cabaret singing stars <b>KT Sullivan<\/b> (who is the Artistic Director of the Mabel Mercer Foundation) and Brooklyn-resident <b>Karen Kohler<\/b> (a multiple cabaret award-winner) will present their celebrated and Award-winning show <i>Vienna to Weimar.<\/i> The show\u2019s Musical Director\/Pianist is <b>Jed Distler<\/b>. Show time is 7:30 pm at the <b>Union Temple Third Floor Social Hall<\/b> and tickets for the event will be $25 ($30 at door).\u00a0<\/p> <p>In Vienna to Weimar, Sullivan and Kohler take the audience on a journey through 1870s Vienna, Austria and the operettas of Johann Strauss and Franz Lehar to 1930s Berlin, Germany and the cabaret music of Friedrich Hollaender, Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht, Mischa Spoliansky, Leonard Cohen, and more. With their provocative blend of voices and feminine sensibilities, Sullivan and Kohler offer compelling interpretations of the Great American and European songbooks and prove that love, lust, power, and illusion are as timeless today as they were nearly 100 years ago.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Vienna to Weimar<\/i> won the 2012 BroadwayWorld.com New York Cabaret Award for \u201cBest Revue\u201d and Sullivan and Kohler were nominated for a 2013 Manhattan Association of Cabarets and Clubs Award for \u201cMajor Duo\/Group.\u201d During 2012, the show played to sold-out houses at Stage 72 (Triad Theater) in New York and Crazy Coqs in London and received rave reviews:\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cYou had the feeling that [Sullivan and Kohler] could take on the world.

The scents and applications of essential oils are transmitted on a molecular level directly to the part of your brain that controls emotional response and memory. Essential Oils also help the practitioner with balance, energy, and deep relaxation.<\/p> <p>Class Description : Class begins with a short centering.

The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floyd\u2019s extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machine\u2019s stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.<\/p> <p>In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970\u2019s Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980\u2019s. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.

From Columbus Circle, we head west and then noodle our way north, exploring Riverside Park's bicycle-friendly pedpaths. Nearing the northernmost point on our ride, we pass Riverside Church and Grant's Tomb. (Who's buried there?) Southbound, we ride the Hudson River Greenway enjoying grand vistas of the Hudson River. Many folks head home on the Greenway, but for those who want to return to our starting point, it's a pleasant ride on city streets back to Columbus Circle where the ride ends between midnight and 12:30am.<\/p> <p>This ride covers 8-10 miles and lasts about 2 hours. Weather? We only cancel when no one in their right mind would have fun. Dress for the weather. We hope these rides encourage folks to enjoy our parks at night: quiet, safe, and relaxed.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LongboardingNYC\/events\/229344026\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Riverside Ride - March 2016","id":"229344026","time":1459044000000,"updated":1459056199000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1250258567000,"name":"Longboarding New York City","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1506406,"urlname":"LongboardingNYC","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Longboarders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10036","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"621 West 46th Street ","address_2":"Between 11th & 12th Aves.","lon":-73.997543,"phone":"212-315-9400","name":"Hudson Terrace","id":852766,"state":"NY","lat":40.764057,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.05060696602,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458592118000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us this weekend for our fun Saturday evening @ Hudson Terrace.\u00a0This is a very popular party with an amazing crowd.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We will be on the first floor of the venue near the coat check area.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Feel free to invite your family, friends and colleagues to join us at Hudson Terrace.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Gents reduced all night long- $20.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/229719047\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvfbkc","time":1459083600000,"updated":1459095849000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Hartsdale","address_1":"475 w hartsdale ave, hartsdale NY","name":"Pat Capone rd football field","lon":-73.79995,"id":24225494,"state":"NY","lat":41.030727,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":28,"headcount":0,"distance":21.8332195282,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1406687537000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ATTENTION!

The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together.

Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And <b>no athletic skill is necessary<\/b>, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

This is a group for all new mamas, including second-timers and formula-feeding mamas. The group size varies from week to week, but it's typically 6-10 moms. Further information is available here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rivertownmamas.com\/groups.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.rivertownmamas.com\/groups.html<\/a><\/p> <p>The group operates on a pay-what-you-wish model, and payment is made anonymously (unless paid by credit card).

Our strategy is a little different from most other teams in this Kaggle competition, where we generated a work flow that starts from text cleaning, passes through feature engineering and ends with model selection and parameter tuning in attempt to stand out among thousands of competitors.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Project 3: Predicting Customer Satisfaction at Santander Bank from Anonymized Data by Anna Bohun, Thomas Boulenger, Adam Owens &amp; Ashwin Swamy<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>As part of an ongoing Kaggle competition, NYCDSA Data Scientists tackle Santander Bank\u2019s question of how to identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Santander aims to take proactive steps to improve their customers' happiness, but faces a major roadblock in trying to make sense out of information that has been anonymized to protect customer privacy. This issue is common in retail today -- how can retailers cater to customers without knowing who they are?<\/p> <p>The Data Scientists designed and engineered a data balancing neural network and compared it to popular gradient boosted machine algorithms. The data scientists will touch on the importance of feature engineering, dimensional reduction, and computational efficiency. The results provide interesting insights into the complications of neural network precision and the operational efficiency of gradient boosted machines.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Open-Data\/events\/229488009\/","yes_rsvp_count":150,"duration":9000000,"name":"Machine Learning project demo

In the late 1920s, he was one of the founding members of the Pan-American Association of Composers (PAAC) in New York, working closely with Henry Cowell and Edgar Var\u00e8se. Ch\u00e1vez, alongside Cuban avant-gardists Amadeo Rold\u00e1n and Alejandro Garc\u00eda Caturla, were the composers whose music was most often performed at the PAAC concerts, and all embraced a firm desire to combine elements from their countries' popular music with traditional concert forms and instruments, creating uniquely American music.

This month, let's explore another challenging topic -\u00a0<i>Stress<\/i>.<\/p> <p>According to <i>Psychology Today<\/i>, \"stress is simply a reaction to a stimulus that disturbs our physical or mental equilibrium. In other words, it's an omnipresent part of life.\" I'd like to add to that to say that the stimulus can be\u00a0a physical threat that triggers an immediate \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response, or it can be more chronic\u00a0and long-term,\u00a0such as in the case of illness, or emotional upset, including separation from or loss of a loved one(s),\u00a0job loss,\u00a0financial difficulties, or even day to day survival.\u00a0Some types of stress, such\u00a0short-term \"butterflies\" before a\u00a0job interview or\u00a0exam can be positive and aid performance. But long-term chronic activation of the internal stress response can have detrimental effects on health. The good news is, although you may not be able to eradicate all of the stressors in your life, it is possible to alter your reaction to them and maintain your \"equilibrium.\"<\/p> <p>Let's explore these questions:<\/p> <p>1. How do you personally define \"stress?\"<\/p> <p>2. Why do we feel it?<\/p> <p>3. When is it positive\/negative?<\/p> <p>4. Why do some people seem more resistant to stress than others?<\/p> <p>5.

Drawing on a wide range of contemporary and classical sources from David Byrne of the Talking Heads to the 18th century German Idealist Immanuel Kant, Jeff Carreira, explains that we are currently caught in an identity of separation and isolation from each other and the world. This book takes the reader step-by-step into the realization that we are part of an unfolding continuity \u2013 a wholeness that grows. As we embrace our potential for living in unity together we open into a new phase of existence.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\nAvailable March,[masked], but Jeff should have advance copies at the event. A small donation will be collected for space rental costs.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nEndorsements for The Soul of a New Self:<\/p> <p>\u201cThe Soul of a New Self is a message from the future, an invitation from an intrepid explorer who has dared to leave behind the familiar and explore the leading edges of humanity\u2019s next evolutionary stage.\u201d\u00a0<br\/>\u2013 Craig Hamilton, Spiritual teacher &amp; founder of Integral Enlightenment\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nJeff has developed a unique and delightful narrative style, weaving a new kind of inquiry he calls \u201cwormholing\u201d with a personal account of his own journey and aspirations. His personal story draws us in as intimate partners in a deeply holistic universe of lived experience. His invitation to \u201cwormhole\u201d with him, helps us to examine the assumptions that underlay the metaphysical foundations of our existing paradigm that constrain all our current worldviews. This is as challenging as pointing out water to a fish \u2013 and yet Jeff guides us through his thought experiments with natural language and playful prodding. This gives us the opportunity to see the world through his enlightened eyes and experience his expansion of the ordinary self into a far greater possibility than we could ever know.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Bonnitta Roy, Founder of Alderlore Insight Center, Associate Editor, Integral Review Journal, Program Coordinator, MA in Consciousness Studies, the Graduate Institute<\/p> <p>\n\nThis is an important book. In writing this Jeff Carreira is prompting us not only to find our individual enlightenment, not only to seek enlightenment collectively, not even to open ourselves to a higher source of wisdom, but to escape the limitations of our dimensionality and actually recognize the relational field as a being. Then to see not only that \u201cI am that\u201d but also we all are that, and \u201cthat\u201d, now and forever, is the soul of the new Self.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Dr. Jeffrey Eisen, author of Oneness Perceived and founder of The PsychoNoetics Science Institute<\/p> <p>\n\nThe Soul of a New Self explores the most vital question of our time: Who are we? Jeff Carreira\u2019s passionate quest and response to this question moves me deeply. He describes his recognition that \u201cI\u201d, the being that I am right now, is the universe awakening to its own existence. Yet it is also true that the individual self is an expression of the universe in unique form. I love this book. It is worthy of true dialogue among us. I hope you will read it and that we will explore it together.<\/p> <p>\u2013 Barbara Marx Hubbard, author of Conscious Evolution, and founder of The Foundation for Conscious Evolution<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout the Author:<\/p> <p>Jeff Carreira is no stranger to the Integral NY Community. He is a mystical philosopher, spiritual guide, and author who teaches meditation and transformative philosophy to a growing number of people throughout the world.<\/p> <p><br\/>Jeff offers retreats and courses in a form of meditation he calls \u201cThe Practice of No Problem.\u201d Through this simple and effective meditation technique Jeff has led thousands of people in the journey beyond the confines of fear and self-concern into the expansive liberated awareness that is our true home.<\/p> <p>As a philosopher, Jeff is interested in defining a new way of being in the world that will move us from our current paradigm of separation and isolation into an emerging paradigm of unity and wholeness. He is exploring and teaching some of the most revolutionary ideas and systems of thought in the domains of spirituality, consciousness, and human development. He leads courses in this new understanding of reality and teaches people how to question their experience until previously held assumptions about the nature of reality fall away to create the space for a dramatically new understanding to emerge.<\/p> <p>Jeff is passionate about philosophy because he is passionate about the power of ideas to shape how we perceive reality and how we live together. His enthusiasm for learning is infectious, and he enjoys addressing student groups and inspiring them to develop their own powers of inquiry.<\/p> <p>Jeff is the author of six books. Three of these, The Miracle of Meditation, The Practice of No Problem, and Embrace All That You Are, clarify his teachings of meditation. The other three, Philosophy Is Not a Luxury, Radical Inclusivity, and The Soul of a New Self, offer a continuously expanding presentation of his philosophical investigations into the nature of reality and how it evolves.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The board above the desk will identify which room we will be in.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/kenwilber-58\/events\/229371638\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"THE SOUL OF A NEW SELF - Book Launch with Jeff Carreira","id":"229371638","time":1459206000000,"updated":1459279126000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1044065632000,"name":"Integral New York's Ken Wilber Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":91120,"urlname":"kenwilber-58","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Integralists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"15 Gramercy Park South","name":"The National Arts Club","lon":-73.986702,"id":15895142,"state":"NY","lat":40.737694,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":19,"headcount":0,"distance":0.869528889656,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457187941000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for our weekly figure drawing session at The National Arts Club.<\/p> <p><b>This session is open to all levels.\u00a0Open to the public.<\/b><\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Let us know you're coming.&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>We operate on a first come first served basis.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Centuries after the cryptically cataclysmic Something That Happened, a Colortocracy, founded on the inflexible absolutes of the chromatic scale, rules the world. Amiable Eddie Russett, a young Red, is looking forward to marrying a notch up on the palette and settling down to a complacent bourgeois life. But after meeting Jane G-23, a rebellious working-class Grey, and a discredited, invisible historian known as the Apocryphal man, Eddie finds himself questioning the hitherto sacred foundations of the status quo. En route to finding out what turned things topsy-turvy, Eddie navigates a vividly imagined landscape whose every facet is steeped in the author's remarkably detailed color scheme.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

Bodhi meditation is unique because they offer free sessions to the community. Nan is a wonderful teacher, and very compassionate person. You can sense that she has extensive experience in oriental medicine including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and energy healing,. Thank you Nan.\u00a0\u201d Joe, Bodhi Meditation class Wednesday October 29, 2014<\/p> <p><br\/>\"It's like looking into the eyes of Pure Love. I've been around meditation, acupuncture, and \"Spiritual Healers\" for over 20 years. In that time I've worked with several healers. Not until I had privilege of meeting Nan Ni did I experience a true healer. Having a session with Nan Ni or \"Nan\" is like looking into the eyes of Pure Love - the kind of selfless Love that you hoped was \"out there\", but didn't really expect to find. Nan has a profound sense of commitment to her patients and students. Her caring, genuine smile comes from deep within and warms you the moment that you meet her. Nan's healing, insightful ways never cease to amaze me and fill me with gratitude. Nan can look at you and know what you need. How many times was I shocked when, without my uttering a word, did she know exactly was what troubling me. I wish I were eloquent enough to express my sincere appreciation for the gift of meeting and working with Nan. Nan's answer to that would be to greet each and every person I meet with an open and loving heart. It is my hope that if you are searching for a healer and\/or a meditation practice and come across these words, that you will know that you've found what you've been searching for. Thank you, Lynn\" Bodhi Meditation Class Saturday March 14, 2014 \u201c Very strong healing energy tonight. I got there feeling very tired. I had stomach pain all day, and during the first meditation of the evening it got a lot better. By the end I wasn't thinking about it at all. I left full of energy. \u201d Pam, Bodhi Meditation class November 22, 2013<\/p> <p>\u201c I didn't realize I would be reaping the benefits of Bodhi Med so quickly after attending only two classes. After my second class I felt even more relaxed. I have insomnia, but after the second session I fell asleep faster and deeper which has not happened for a long time. \u201d Dee, Bodhi Meditation class September 18, 2013<\/p> <p>It was enlightening!!!

Come cuddle with us!<\/p> <p>About Cuddle Party from Monique:<\/p> <p>I have facilitated 100\u2032s of Cuddle Parties. I am as passionate about the Cuddle Party experience today, as I was the first one, over five years ago. YES! It helped me reclaim my voice and I am passionate about helping others do the same.<\/p> <p>Cuddle Party experiences teach participants, they alone create their own safety container. How did it change my life? When I was growing up and received a NO, it felt like I was being rejected. The result was my emphasis on being nice, being lovable and being unconditionally available. The profound learning came when I realized my unyielding YES\u2019s became a subconscious inability to trust another person\u2019s YES, without their own personally vocalized NO!<\/p> <p>I am very appreciative and honored by the courage shown by those who have clear boundaries, and an ability to voice their YES and NO decisions without guilt, shame or fear. It gives me the confidence to ask for what my own heart desires, instead of censoring myself, knowing the receiver of my request has the voice and courage to embrace or withdraw, based on their own perimeters. \u201cThank you for taking care of your self\u201d<\/p> <p>After the Welcome Circle, Reid will offer a mini version of his speed flirting class, to help break the ice and dive us into getting to know one another.<\/p> <p>Speed-Flirting is a rambunctious, social event for men, women, humans of all ages.

This particular event aims to raise $100,000 to go directly to the<br\/>New York Abortion Access Fund. Only heavy balls - and generous donations - will combat such a heavy topic.<\/p> <p>Some of you maybe be wondering why New York would need such a fund, since the state is considered one of the most liberal when it comes to abortion services. Decades before Roe V Wade, New York was a destination for women in need of safe abortions and will continue to be, especially for women from Pennsylvania where the state's restrictions on abortions went into effect last December. Furthermore, 12% of New York women live in counties with no abortion providers. The money you donate will be helping women from New York and other states, fund their procedure, travel and lodging so they can get the help they need.<\/p> <p>We are having a fundraiser at grassroots tavern to raise money for the event. Please join us to learn more about abortion access and donate whatever you can for the cause.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>\n\nBOOKER T.

Written rules for SuperFight:<\/p> <p>SUPERFIGHT BASIC RULES<\/p> <p>The Setup:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Youngest player goes first. Player one<br\/>starts by drawing three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them,<br\/>but don\u2019t let anyone else see them.<br\/>Player two (the next player to the left) does<br\/>the same.<\/p> <p>Each player chooses one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hand to create a<br\/>fighter and places those cards face down.<br\/>Then they discard their remaining cards<br\/>into two separate piles (one for characters,<br\/>one for attributes).<br\/>Next, both players turn over their cards and<br\/>reveal their fighters.<br\/>Each player then draws a random black<br\/>card from the deck and adds it to their<br\/>fighter.<\/p> <p>The Superfight:<br\/>Both players argue and plead their cases<br\/>about why their fighters would win the fight.<br\/>Once the arguing is done, the table votes<br\/>for a winner.<\/p> <p>In the event of a tie, both players draw a<br\/>random white card and fight to the death<br\/>with no attributes. The table votes again. Do<br\/>this until there is a winner, then discard the<br\/>white cards from the tiebreaker fights.<br\/>The winning fighter stays on the table for<br\/>the next player to fight and will not get any<br\/>new attributes in the next fight. The player<br\/>who won the fight earns one point.<\/p> <p>The Next Match:<br\/>Player three (the next player to the left) now<br\/>creates a fighter to battle the winner from<br\/>the last match, following the same rules for<br\/>fighter creation as in The Setup. Then The<br\/>Superfight begins again.<\/p> <p>ALTERNATE RULES<\/p> <p>Villain Battle:<br\/>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>Every player draws three white cards and<br\/>three black cards. You can look at them, but<br\/>don\u2019t let anyone else see them. The least liked<br\/>person at the table takes the first turn<br\/>as the Villain.<\/p> <p>The Villain chooses one white card and one<br\/>black card from their hand and places those<br\/>cards face up on the table. Then the Villain<br\/>draws one random black card from the<br\/>deck and adds it to their fighter.<\/p> <p>All other players choose one white card and<br\/>one black card from their hands to create<br\/>fighters to defeat the Villain. When everyone<br\/>is ready, reveal the fighters one at a time and<br\/>announce them to the table. Starting with the<br\/>player to the left of the Villain, play an<br\/>additional black card from your hand onto<br\/>any fighter on the table (including the Villain<br\/>or yourself!) and then discard the rest of your<br\/>hand.<\/p> <p>Next the Villain picks who would do the best<br\/>against his or her fighter. That fighter wins<br\/>the battle and gets one point.<br\/>The player to the left of the current Villain<br\/>becomes the new Villain. Every player draws<br\/>three new white cards and three new black<br\/>cards, and a new battle begins.<\/p> <p>Battle Royale:<\/p> <p>Separate the white-backed cards<br\/>(characters) and the black-backed cards<br\/>(attributes).<\/p> <p>All players draw three white cards and three<br\/>black cards. You can look at them, but don\u2019t<br\/>let anyone else see them. Each player places<br\/>one white card and one black card face<br\/>down on the table. One at a time, players<br\/>reveal their fighters and announce the<br\/>fighters to the table.<\/p> <p>Before playing the second black card, select<br\/>one of the following game modes:<\/p> <p>A) Each fighter\u2019s second black card is drawn<br\/>randomly from the deck.<\/p> <p>B) Players may play one additional black<br\/>card from their hands onto any fighter at<br\/>the table (including themselves).<br\/>Everyone votes on which fighter would be<br\/>the last one standing.<\/p> <p>Pacifists:<br\/>Follow any of the rules outlined above, but<br\/>this time choose the winner based on who<br\/>is the funniest, or imagine it\u2019s a dating<br\/>website and you\u2019re picking the best match.<br\/>Pick who would be the best construction<br\/>worker, or nanny, or use your imagination!<\/p> <p>Finally:<br\/>Unlike other judge-based games, this is not<br\/>anonymous. If a player is being biased, for<br\/>whatever dumb reason, never play with<br\/>that person again. They are lame, and<br\/>should go play charades with their cats<br\/>until they learn how to play with people.<br\/>Imagine the fighters are fighting on an<br\/>island or anywhere you want, but New York<br\/>is a good default.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC\/events\/229488492\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Anime Rosario & Vampire -  ANIME SUPERFIGHT Card game night.","id":"xttjmlyvfbmc","time":1459288800000,"updated":1459301356000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427264208000,"name":"Anime, Cosplay, Food, Super Smash Bros & Karaoke Fans NYC","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":18519287,"urlname":"Anime-Cosplay-Food-Super-Smash-Bros-Karaoke-NYC","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Anime & Cosplay lovers NYC"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10954","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nanuet","address_1":"148 New York 59","name":"Growler & Gill Craft Beer Shoppe","lon":-74.005318,"id":12155462,"state":"NY","lat":41.094646,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":23.8746814728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1404759557000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Best \u00a0Early Start Open Mic Around!
