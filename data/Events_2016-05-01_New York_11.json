So please come.<\/p> <p>Details for the outing are:<\/p> <p>-- Arrival: Come by 12:50 so you have time to pay for your round.<\/p> <p>-- Where to meet: We will meet at the counter area where you pay for golf.<\/p> <p>-- Reservation time: We have a threesome at 1:09.<\/p> <p>Let me add some information on Galloping Hill. This course recently aerated its greens. That can sometimes make a perfectly good put go off line. Also, as said in my earlier note (on the tentative outing) this course is a bit hilly. It\u2019s still walkable but you might want a cart. As for cost, it\u2019s $55 for the 18 holes (for those who don\u2019t have a Union County player\u2019s card) and $16 for a cart.<\/p> <p>Feel free to contact me as needed.<\/p> <p>Hill Rose<br\/>cell:[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cranford-Social-Golf-Club-Meetup-for-Young-Seniors\/events\/230660067\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"DEFINITE golf meetup for Fri. 4\/29","id":"230660067","time":1461948300000,"updated":1461960958000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443728474000,"name":"Cranford Social Golf Club Meetup -- for Young Seniors","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":18986565,"urlname":"Cranford-Social-Golf-Club-Meetup-for-Young-Seniors","group_lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Golf for young seniors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10960","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Nyack ","address_1":"35 South Broadway","lon":-73.918089,"phone":"914-328-2874","name":"Nyack YMCA","id":863459,"state":"NY","lat":41.089652,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":23.8145484924,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413733115000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for Friday afternoon inspiration-- we'll share a writing prompt and hear readings of each other's fresh-on-the-page work.

Opening on Wednesday, April 27, the exhibition is the presentation of bas-reliefs.<\/p> <p>\u201cI believe in staying true to myself throughout the creative process of wordless expression, regardless of past influences and current trends.\u201d<br\/>- Janusz Obst<\/p> <p>Janusz Obst is a classically trained artist from Zamosc, Poland, where he was born in 1946. As a young marine, he travelled the world, having spent much of his young adult life in Europe, China, Africa, and India. It was in India where he was captivated by sculpture, and for the last three decades he has focused his work on bas-relief.<\/p> <p>Bas-reliefs, traditionally having been painted, give Janusz the opportunity to resurrect his love for this classic art form and marry his passion for sculpture and painting. This methodology allows him to freely build three-dimensional space and to broaden the narrative possibilities within each piece. His art permeates the interaction between the history of civilization, individual fate, current social and community-based issues, and his unfaltering interest in the interpersonal relationships within the context of the modern world.<br\/>Janusz moved to the United States in 1991, and he currently lives in New York City.<\/p> <p>The opening reception for Wordless Dimension will be on Friday, April 29, 2016.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ashokjaingallery\/events\/230421262\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Janusz Obst's Wordless Dimension","id":"230421262","time":1461967200000,"updated":1461975765000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454785015000,"name":"Ashok Jain Contemporary Art","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19524967,"urlname":"ashokjaingallery","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Parsippany","address_1":"1735 Route 46","name":"Houlihan's","lon":-74.408546,"id":24477240,"state":"NJ","lat":40.865234,"repinned":false},"headcount":2,"distance":23.3394088745,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460172214000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Drink &amp; App Specials<\/p> <p><br\/>$1 off:<br\/>domestic &amp; import draft beers<br\/>featured drinks on our drink menu<br\/>all house wine<\/p> <p>Appetizer specials starting at $5<\/p> <p>***you could also join Houlihan's and you get a $10 off coupon!<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.houlihans.com\/email-club\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.houlihans.com\/email-club\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.houlihans.com\/email-club<\/a><\/a>\u00a0(I did)<\/p> <p>Join our email list for special events and offers.

The added value with the event is that we will also have an audience in attendance watching the process, and we hope that this will create an event where the community can learn alongside the entrepreneurs as they develop their pitches and startups.<\/p> <p><b>Here are the list of startups pitching on the night of:<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nLaunchable Labs -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.launchablelabs.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.launchablelabs.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.launchablelabs.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Picketfencer -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.picketfencer.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.picketfencer.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.picketfencer.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Vocate Academy -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vocateacademy.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vocateacademy.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.vocateacademy.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nHope to see everyone out that evening!<\/p> <p><br\/>Schedule:<\/p> <p>6:30pm - 7:00pm Open networking and food<\/p> <p>7:00pm - 8:45pm Startup pitches and feedback<\/p> <p>8:45pm - 9:30pm After party in Mead Hall<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDirections:<\/p> <p>The event will be held at Brothers College at Drew University.

The number one complaint of cyclists was always safety. Group bicycle rides, like the critical mass, were one of the few places where cyclists could ride together and be safe. Besides their safe and fun dynamic, the group rides steadily attracted new riders which in turn built up the confidence in the riders to become everyday commuters.<\/p> <p>In early 2000, the New York City critical mass started gaining huge popularity due to it's celebratory spirit and safe community environment. Bikers of all types would meet the last Friday of every month, as they do in over two hundred cities around the globe, for the monthly critical mass rides. The critical mass ride in New York City has always been a place where new riders could feel safe while building a strong community voice for non polluting transportation.<\/p> <p>Eventually, after much persistence and global media embarrassment, the bicycle community got their way and New York City hired a new and bike friendly D.O.T commissioner who had vision. Today, our new greener, safer and bike friendly city is now enjoyed by all. In fact, the very spot in Times Square where each month thousands of cyclists raised their bikes over their heads is now an auto free zone.<\/p> <p>Thank you New York City critical mass for this positive sustainable change!<\/p> <p>For more information check out <a href=\"http:\/\/times-up.org\/rides\/critical-mass\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/times-up.org\/rides\/critical-mass\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-bike-food\/events\/230158593\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Monthly Critical Mass Ride","id":"230158593","time":1461970800000,"updated":1461983205000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1153865434000,"name":"NYC Cycling & Food","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":291209,"urlname":"nyc-bike-food","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"cyclists\/foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"08840","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Metuchen","address_1":"215 Durham Avenue","name":"Metuchen Sportsplex","lon":-74.371872,"id":8697892,"state":"NJ","lat":40.542461,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6755084991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":5,"created":1461424391000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Details on how to pay are here:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/events\/230591460\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Volleyball Open Gym","id":"230591460","time":1461970800000,"updated":1462020717000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344491820000,"name":"Greater Metro Area Volleyball Club (GMAVC)","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":4504982,"urlname":"Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club","group_lat":40.5400009155,"who":"VBallers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"55 Lexington Avenue","name":"Engelman Recital Hall, Baruch College","lon":-73.983986,"id":15754682,"state":"NY","lat":40.740047,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.757913470268,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460415755000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Desire of nations presents Sweet Surrender Concert<br\/>featuring gospel singer Vashawn Mitchell<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYChristiansandFriends\/events\/230303737\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Free worship concert featuring Vashawn Mitchell","id":"230303737","time":1461970800000,"updated":1461983223000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1283481435000,"name":"NY Christians & Friends","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1700984,"urlname":"NYChristiansandFriends","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":" 241 W 30th Street, 2nd Fl.","name":"Edgar Cayce's A.R.E of New York","lon":-73.993835,"id":24201493,"lat":40.749207,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.208733320236,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456026898000,"fee":{"amount":35,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for this fascinating exploration of mediumship.

The third annual 7 Piscos: 14 Cocktails \u2013 Ceviche and Pisco Party will take place on April 29 from 7-10 pm and will allow you to personally experience delicious ways to utilize Pisco, apart from the traditional Pisco Sour and Chilcano. You will have complete access to 14 mouth-watering summer cocktails from seven different Pisco brands. This makes a total of fourteen innovative drinks made by very creative mixologists that blend Peruvian flavors such as our yellow spicy pepper and tropical fruit like mango, into the perfect refreshing combination. The summer is coming up and we want you to choose which cocktail will be in season. A DJ will help us set the mood while we show off how versatile, easy to blend and tasty it is to use Pisco instead of other liquors while you enjoy the party.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Served by 2 restaurants, Coco Roco and Runa, the menu will feature two different kinds of ceviches. The first one, \u201cclasico,\u201d made with fresh fish and lemon while the second one, called \u201cmixto,\u201d includes shrimp, artichoke and a variety of fish. These dishes are Peruvian classics and luckily we have chosen two restaurants that truly master the dish. Apart from ceviche, we will also be serving fresh salads, one with Peruvian avocados and the other with quinoa. Our typical \u201cAji de Gallina,\u201d which is shredded chicken in a yellow pepper sauce, will also be served along with Shrimp \u201cQuinoto,\u201d which will surely leave you satisfied. To sweeten the deal, Peruvian truffles and alfajores are for dessert.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Tickets cost $78.00 each and include as many Pisco cocktails as you can drink (hopefully you will have the opportunity to try all 14) as well as complementary appetizers (as mentioned before) that have been meticulously prepared. Your ticket pre-purchase enters you into a draw for some exciting raffle prizes including bottles of Pisco, a trip to Lima, Peru for two and other prizes.<\/p> <p>Our Pisco is produced from eight kinds of grape grown in Pisco, Peru. Those eight varieties are evenly divided into Non-Aromatic (Quebranta, Negra Criolla, Mollar, Uvina) and Aromatic (Italia, Toronelo, Moscatel, Albilla).\u00a0<br\/>Then, each grape can be processed using three styles: Puro (uses only one grape), Acholado (blends different types of grapes), and Mosto Verde (in which the fermentation process is halted).<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at #7Piscos on April 29, 2016 at the Midtown Loft and Terrace located on 267 5th Ave.<br\/>Supported by the Trade Commission of Peru in New York<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTickets: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.naturallyperu.nyc\/new-events\/2016\/4\/29\/7-piscos-14-cocktails-1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.naturallyperu.nyc\/new-events\/2016\/4\/29\/7-piscos-14-cocktails-1\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.naturallyperu.nyc\/new-events\/2016\/4\/29\/7-piscos-14-cocktails-1<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/9\/3\/600_449133683.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bestgastronomictours\/events\/230524279\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Peruvian night party: 7 Piscos 14 Cocktails","id":"230524279","time":1461970800000,"updated":1461983248000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1454105671000,"name":"New York  to Peru Foodie Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":19461612,"urlname":"bestgastronomictours","group_lat":40.75,"who":"foodies travellers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"520 8th Avenue","name":"Ripley-Grier Studios","lon":-73.991768,"id":15607412,"state":"NY","lat":40.753613,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.266807258129,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1460685354000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Friday Chicago Stepping Lesson in Midtown<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>Join the Empire Steppers to learn Chicago stepping.

It is a life in which we set high standards for ourselves in all areas; a life in which we use our God-given talents to elevate ourselves and our communities to the best of our abilities. It is a life in which we approach God through the totality of the faculties he gave us; a life in which our worship of God, in this broad sense of the word, constitutes the very meaning of our existence. It is, all around, a life of excellence.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Sheikh Muhammad \u2018Abduh [masked]) was an Egyptian religious scholar and reformer. He believed in reason and opposed a rigid, ritualistic or dogmatic approach to Islam. He held high religious posts, including that of Mufti of Egypt. His goal was to reform Islam and put it in harmony with modernity by returning to primitive purity. He is considered the founder of the modernist school in Islam.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Please feel free to bring healthy snacks to share. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>We ask attendees to contribute $5 each for the rental of the location.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Muslim-Reform\/events\/229949358\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"The Pursuit of Knowledge, Excellence and Progress in Islam","id":"229949358","time":1461972600000,"updated":1462058567000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1433732950000,"name":"Muslim Reform","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18656555,"urlname":"Muslim-Reform","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"172 Rivington St.","name":"Black Cat Cafe","lon":-73.984512,"id":18325152,"state":"NY","lat":40.719128,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.15671300888,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461800057000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Free Admission and NO Drink Min.

Viewers should be warned: this is not an easy film to watch by any stretch of the imagination. The entire film is a series of increasingly violent and humiliating exercises in sadism, which become increasingly graphic as the film progresses; the final \"Circle of Death\" is excruciating to view. Yet it is not simply the explicitness of the decadence and cruelty on display that makes Salo the uniquely disturbing experience that it is. Indeed, other films are more graphic in this area. But these other films tend to present these experiences in an ironic, campy or otherwise contextual manner that lessens their impact. Salo takes a purposely distancing view, a \"hands off\" approach that is much more harrowing and that relentlessly drives home its intended atmosphere of hopelessness and impotence. Its creator, Pier Paolo Pasolini is intent on getting across his message that there are depths of humanity that are intensely vile and repulsive and that to ignore the existence of this can only lead to its re-emergence and domination. He is also making implicit statements about how this depravity is a feature of both Fascism and capitalism. Pasolini purposely makes Salo a disturbing and disgusting experience to drive home his points; whether a viewer feels that sitting through two hours of sadism in order to absorb this point is worthwhile or not will influence his reaction to the work. Objectively, however, it can be said that Pasolini's intentionally static direction is impressive, as is his ability to create tension despite this static quality, and that Torino Delli Colli's cinematography and the physical production are stunning.<\/p> <p><br\/>The final work of notorious Italian director\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/pier-paolo-pasolini-p105725\">Pier Paolo Pasolini<\/a>, this film updates the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/marquis-de-sade-p314485\">Marquis de Sade<\/a>'s most extreme novel to fascist Italy in the final days of WW II.

What seems merely to be a third-rate gig escalates into something much more sinister when they witness an act of violence backstage that they weren\u2019t meant to see. Now trapped backstage, they must face off against the club\u2019s depraved owner, Darcy Banker (Patrick Stewart), a man who will do anything to protect the secrets of his nefarious enterprise. But while Darcy and his henchmen think the band will be easy to get rid of, The Ain\u2019t Rights prove themselves much more cunning and capable than anyone expected, turning the tables on their unsuspecting captors and setting the stage for the ultimate life-or-death showdown.<\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4DF-7rHKsu4\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4DF-7rHKsu4<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>You can buy tickets <a href=\"https:\/\/tickets.fandango.com\/transaction\/ticketing\/express\/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=128723319&amp;mid=188399&amp;tid=AABQI\">here<\/a>.

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in NYC?<\/p> <p><br\/>We play 3 communication game (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:40p.

Holi Hai is an ancient Hindu religious festival observed in India and Nepal that celebrates the coming of spring and the joy of friendship. Also known as the Festival of Colors this event is a free-for-all carnival of colors, where participants play, chase, toss and sprinkle a variety of vividly colored powders on each other (powders are safe, non-toxic, and FDA approved). Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. Holi has further social significance as a day to forgive one's past mistakes, to end conflicts with others and repair damaged relationships, and to just celebrate and let go. As a result expect loud music, lots of food, noise, and fun!<\/p> <p><b>Date: <\/b>Saturday, April 30, 2016<\/p> <p><b>Time:<\/b> 9:30 AM<br\/><b>Meeting place:<\/b>\u00a0Corner of Canal and Forsyth Street near the Manhattan Bridge.<\/p> <p><b>Register for for FREE<\/b> at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/nyc-holi-hai-2016-tickets-21441584356\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/nyc-holi-hai-2016-tickets-21441584356\/<\/a>.

Recently there have been complaints from a camp outside East Barrow, concerning an outspoken worshiper of Tyrus, the god of darkness, who has been trying to convert his fellow refugees. This man has not technically broken any laws, but given the sinister reputation of Tyrus's following, the Frankish military is concerned. The Franks have quietly asked that a group of freelancers travel to this camp posing as refugees, meet this priest of Tyrus, and determine whether he has any hidden agenda. They are willing to pay for any information gathered.<\/p> <p>\n\nA refugee camp makes for an uneasy place, where once-separate walks of life are abruptly forced together. They all seek a refuge from war, but some bring the war with them...<\/p> <p>\n\nEvent Info:<\/p> <p><br\/>This is a Level 30 Cap Event. For this event, players can choose whether their character is working with the Frankish military, or if that doesn't suit their backstory, they can be one of the refugees already in the camp.<\/p> <p>\n\nIMPORTANT: If at all possible, please pay by Pay-pal! (we are [masked])\u00a0It's a lot easier for us to account for everything. Events are $15 per player, but for first-time players it's free. Helping to run the event on monster crew is of course free as well.<\/p> <p>\n\nUsual bit here everyone, try and be in kit and ready by 10am.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

Needless to say, please take the RSVP process seriously and be considerate. If you have been a NO SHOW on any previous AMC Meetup event that I have led or are an abuser of the RSVP process\u2013see your Attendance History- please do not sign up for this event because I am just going to delete your RSVP.

You have more than enough information to do this once you get the meeting details. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to know-and probably neither does anyone else- what you are doing that day if you can\u2019t make it or what you think the weather will be. AFTER the event, post as many comments and photos as you like.<\/p> <p>If the weather forecast is really bad, See the Accuweather website like I do, I will post a notice on the day of the hike by 8:00 A.M.

At these critical points, system forgets about the microscopic details, it becomes scale invariant and the dynamics is governed by the long wavelength degrees of freedom, which explains the universal behavior of di\ufb00erent microscopic systems (such as: proteins, water, magnets) at the critical points, characterized by the critical exponents. In addition, detailed analyses of these concepts have helped us clarify old issues related to renormalization in Quantum Field Theory and these critical exponent\u00a0could surprisingly be calculated using Feynman Diagrams\u00a0(an epsilon expansion).<\/p> <p><br\/>Reference:<\/p> <p>1] <a href=\"http:\/\/www-math.unice.fr\/%7Epatras\/CargeseConference\/ACQFT09_JZinnJustin.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www-math.unice.fr\/~patras\/CargeseConference\/ACQFT09_JZinnJustin.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www-math.unice.fr\/~patras\/CargeseConference\/ACQFT09_JZinnJustin.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>2] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scholarpedia.org\/article\/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scholarpedia.org\/article\/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.scholarpedia.org\/article\/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>3] <a href=\"http:\/\/staff.washington.edu\/bdjwww\/1973WilsonKogut.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/staff.washington.edu\/bdjwww\/1973WilsonKogut.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/staff.washington.edu\/bdjwww\/1973WilsonKogut.pdf<\/a><\/a> \u00a0 I've found the introductory discussion (pages78-83) extremely useful.<\/p> <p>4] An Introduction of Quantum Field Theory, Peskin and Schroeder (Chapter 12 &amp; 13)<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Note: <\/b><\/p> <p>The NY Quantum Theory Meetup group is most thankful to ThoughtWorks for gracefully allowing us to use their premises.

Brimming with hometown pride, it\u2019s a small neighbourhood within the fourth largest city in the world. Most people from Bay Ridge are born there and live there until the day they die - commuting to Manhattan for work but always returning to the block they call home. Ask people here where they\u2019re from and they don\u2019t say Brooklyn, they say Bay Ridge.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Destinations and Attractions:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>#1 -LESKE'S BAKERY - 7612 Fifth Avenue, (718)[masked] (R train - 77 Street Station)<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>We will begin our day with a sweet light breakfast at LESKE'S BAKERY. After over half a century in Bay Ridge, Leske's has firmly established itself in the culinary fabric of the neighborhood. It's a bakery in the truest sense of the word; everything is baked at their Fifth Avenue facility, leaving just enough room for a long glass case to display all the goodies. Seating inside? Fuggedaboutit. Luckily, many of their treats are meant to be consumed sans knife and fork, like their legendary Black and Whites ($2.50), oodles of cookies and maple bacon-covered doughnuts ($1.75). But for the ultimate hostess gift or to snag brownie points with visiting family, be sure to snag one of their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leskesbakery.com\/kringlerklub\/\">Kringlers<\/a> ($11), pretzel-shaped pastries filled with fruits like apricot and raspberry. Then there are the incredible Pecan Rings ($14.75), frosted and topped with nuts and cheese, if you wish. There's almost no end to the parade of delicious baked goods they offering, from their traditional Scandinavian rye bread, Irish soda bread, almond croissants, cheese cake, black out cake, danish, breads and rolls.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.leskesbakery.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.leskesbakery.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.leskesbakery.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>#2- BROOKLYN BEET COMPANY -[masked]rd Avenue, (347)[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>BROOKLYN BEET COMPANY If you don't like communal seating, you may not get on board with the third in the fleet of Korzo restaurants. If you like delicious burgers, however, this is a must-see on your tour of Bay Ridge.

If you'd like to keep your arteries open for a few more trips around the sun, consider the restaurant's lighter fare, like Steamed PEI Mussels ($16) in a fragrant shallot, cilantro, jalapeno, pork belly and mushroom broth or the Organic Quinoa Trout Salad ($17), stuffed with arugula, blackened corn, summer squash, trout and a poached farm egg.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.korzorestaurant.com\/bbc-brunch\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.korzorestaurant.com\/bbc-brunch\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.korzorestaurant.com\/bbc-brunch\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>#3- KARAM -[masked]th Avenue, (718)[masked]<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>KARAM \"You know a place is good when it's the size of a shoe closet, has looked the same for 20 years, and is always packed to the gills with middle eastern men.\" That's how Allison Robicelli describes this lively schawarma spot, where they're roasting seasoned meats right in the window and displaying all sorts of other Middle Eastern treats in glasses cases inside. You'll find quite a few of these no frills spots to grab an inexpensive plate of falafel in the neighborhood, but the playful staff and generous portions here make this a local favorite. They're not going to win any design awards, but it's what's inside the pita the counts. Like thinly shaved marinated lamb ($5), spicy beef and lamb sausages ($7.50) and babaghanouj ($5) topped with tahini.

One reason they do comes from a misperception we have of being separate and isolated from everything else. And, it\u2019s true that\u00a0our perceptions seem to \u201cprove\u201d that separation is true. \u00a0But, in moments of clear awareness, we also have glimpses of being an integral part of a kind of universal everything. Those glimpses seem reason enough to investigate our misconception about absolute separateness and expand our view toward knowing more open and expansive awareness.<\/p> <p>And, we can apply this investigation toward a better understanding of our relationship to greed and wanting and desire. If the body needs nourishment, our hunger lets us know to look for food. \u00a0But when we get overwhelmed or consumed by the desire, it\u00a0can be a short trip from satisfying basic needs to incessant seeking anything and everything we believe will let the isolated and separate \u201cme\u201d feel safe and happy.<\/p> <p>Trying to look at our relationship with greed\u00a0is tricky because it has many flavors from powerful to subtle. It\u2019s easy to\u00a0miss how it operates in us since we tend to only\u00a0pay attention to what we want, not that we are wanting. We also often\u00a0know what needs\u00a0to happen to satisfy our \u201cseparate self,\u201d but we miss the fact\u00a0that we created those\u00a0expectations in the first place.

It is currently available for pre-order on Amazon.com<\/p> <p>Book Summary: A warm, funny and acutely perceptive debut novel about four adult siblings and the fate of the shared inheritance that has shaped their choices and their lives.<\/p> <p>Every family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs' joint trust fund, \u201cThe Nest,\u201d which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest\u2019s value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems.<\/p> <p>Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can\u2019t seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the futures they\u2019ve envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.<\/p> <p>This is a story about the power of family, the possibilities of friendship, the ways we depend upon one another and the ways we let one another down. In this tender, entertaining, and deftly written debut, Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney brings a remarkable cast of characters to life to illuminate what money does to relationships, what happens to our ambitions over the course of time, and the fraught yet unbreakable ties we share with those we love.<\/p> <p>I look forward to seeing you all at this month's book club event!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s\/events\/229350782\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"April Book Club Brunch","id":"229350782","time":1462030200000,"updated":1462038348000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1400015507000,"name":"Girl Friends near Millburn\/Cranford NJ (late 20's - 30's)","group_lon":-74.3000030518,"id":14438052,"urlname":"Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"358 West 44th street ","name":"The Producer's Club Theaters ","lon":-73.990753,"id":23752357,"state":"NY","lat":40.759289,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"distance":0.644349515438,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461783855000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Tickets are $15 and must be purchased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nycindieff.com\/event\/panel-vr-cinema-presentation\">at this link<\/a>. \u00a0The presentation will be similar to the \"VR as a New Medium\" presentation from a few months back. \u00a0If you missed the first talk, I'd recommend this one, otherwise you can wait for the next original VR talk. \u00a0Talks we will have coming up - but are still scheduling - are pre-production and screenwriting for VR, and spatial audio in VR.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Cinematic-Virtual-Reality\/events\/230694655\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Field Trip: NYC Independent Film Festival VR Talk","id":"230694655","time":1462030200000,"updated":1462060157000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444235775000,"name":"Cinematic VR NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19005133,"urlname":"NY-Cinematic-Virtual-Reality","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"CVR Filmmakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"15 Main St","name":"Atrium Dumbo","lon":-73.990677,"id":21470072,"lat":40.7034,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":3.22667860985,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458491619000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>$20.00 Deposit to reserve your spot - we are offering refunds until April 14th.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"TBC","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club\/events\/229735914\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Brooklyn Brunch!","id":"229735914","time":1462030200000,"updated":1462042872000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1300804164000,"name":"The New York Girly Book Club","group_lon":-74,"id":1802703,"urlname":"The-New-York-Girly-Book-Club","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"101 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY","name":"Outside of the entrance to the Bean Coffee Shop","lon":0,"id":22641702,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":32,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":66,"created":1458305723000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY, ESPECIALLY THE BOLD TYPE.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you are registered for this walk and can't attend, please change your RSVP online from \"YES\" to \"NO\".

In particular, our meetup plays games that encourage socializing, fragile partnerships and everyone\u2019s favorite, lying!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/4\/b\/9\/600_446858073.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u201cBut Bill\u201d you might say, \u201cNoon? Really?\u201d I know, it's super early for a Saturday but we'll be there for at least seven hours so show up whenever your bedroom stops spinning and you can comfortably handle \u00a0the thought of beer. \u00a0<\/p> <p>As day turns to night Diana will arrive to take over, ushering in an evening of more drinks and even more games!

Don't bend the cards and be mindful of drinks and food. Also, we've created a culture of gracious winners and losers so remember the games are all in good fun. \u00a0Lastly, rules are harder to explain then you might think so be patient with the anyone trying.<\/p> <p>And for those experienced gamers, the emphasis at this event will be on gateway and family weight games for a beginner-friendly experience. That said, feel free to bring your copy of The Cones of Dunshire--just don't push it on less experienced gamers.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Suggested Price of Admission<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>For $3, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.impactnetwork.org\/\"><b>Impact Network<\/b>\u00a0<\/a>can educate a student in Zambia for a month.\u00a0 With that in mind, I'm going to suggest everyone who comes chip in $3.\u00a0 What do you get for your money?\u00a0 Me, my sparkling smile and a pile of games to play with for hours.\u00a0 And with any luck, they'll be spinning vinyl records. \u00a0So come, have a beer, meet good people, listen to some funky music and play great games for a good good cause.\u00a0 I challenge you to find a better deal for three bucks!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/f\/4\/highres_370741012.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"516 314-0228","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/friendsneighborsandco\/events\/229400092\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":21600000,"name":"Board Gameday--Internatio\u00adnal Tabletop Day","id":"229400092","time":1462032000000,"updated":1462105897000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1339437557000,"name":"Friends, Neighbors & Co.","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":4054132,"urlname":"friendsneighborsandco","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"New Yawkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Tarrytown","address_1":"635 South Broadway","name":"Lyndhurst Castle","lon":-73.860954,"id":24192002,"state":"NY","lat":41.054131,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.1126079559,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458507214000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>For those of you who haven't been to the Lyndhurst Castle, the castle and grounds are gorgeous, right on the Hudson, and the crafts fair is supposed to be one of the best in the nation.<\/p> <p>Tickets are $12.

The creek's source is Thompson Pond near Pine Plains, and it heads southeastward towards its mouth in the Hudson River near New Hamburg. Along the way, it goes through fluctuations in width and follows an erratic path; in Wappingers Falls, it forms Wappinger Lake, a man-made reservoir. The initial .25 mi (0.40 km) of the creek runs through rocky, steep, wooded terrain. However as it approaches the Hudson it enters the river's tidal range, and has sandbars, mudflats and marshes. The creek is also home to numerous species, and is an important spawning area for anadromous fish, which thrive in the creek between April and June. Largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, red-breasted sunfish, and brown bullhead, however, are resident species. Also, the creek is annually stocked with various species of trout for the purpose of recreational fishing.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/d\/c\/0\/event_357851712.jpeghttp:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/2\/6\/event_435252326.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet by the baseball park","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-River-and-Beyond-Kayaking\/events\/229690105\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":10800000,"name":"Wappinger Creek Post Derby Paddle","id":"229690105","time":1462032000000,"updated":1462124968000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1134157270000,"name":"Hudson River and Beyond  Kayaking Club","group_lon":-73.8700027466,"id":216001,"urlname":"Hudson-River-and-Beyond-Kayaking","group_lat":41.0099983215,"who":"Kayakers and Fun Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"54 Coles St","name":"Grassroots Community Space","lon":-74.047409,"id":23712570,"lat":40.72364,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.52146553993,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461811378000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The weekend is almost here!!

When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Blessings\u00a0<\/p> <p>Simon\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u00ae \u201cVortexHealing\" is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

It was evident that the power of the construct raiding party was far too powerful for any one organization to muster, but rather a complex conspiracy possibly with one or more of the Kraken Society, Cultists of the Dragon or Zhentarim involved. An offhand comment by a Nothic during the encounter referred to the party as Demon Slayers. The party has now christened themselves the \"Demonsbane\" party which speaks volumes of their bravery. Such a name is likely to attract unwelcome attention in Faerun to test their mettle. Upon their return to Silverymoon, the party accepted Mirabel's quest to find her lost son Farlien who disappeared in the Savage Frontier region. He last spoke of the Evermoors and Trackless Sea in his last communication. The party earned 425XP for the last adventure, the good favor of the Sundahar leadership and is waiting on craftsmen to add silver to their bladed weapons.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation\u00a0of $10.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. \u00a0Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> by the name Krishna.<\/p> <p>Here is\u00a0the general schedule of our\u00a0meetups:\u00a0we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 Then, we\u00a0have a class on <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>, which lasts\u00a0for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the class, we will go through verses of the <i>Gita<\/i> in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. \u00a0By about 7:30, the last kirtan\u00a0begins;\u00a0it lasts for about 30 minutes. \u00a0A\u00a0sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p> <p>Admission to each meetup is free. \u00a0Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p> <p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in courts throughout the country, with his office in Long Island, and his concentration in securities and derivative litigation. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/230079100\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Bhagavad-gita Class & Kirtan @ 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays at 26 2nd Avenue, NY, NY","id":"mptgrlyvgbnc","time":1462051800000,"updated":1462064174000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10032","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"65 Jumel Terrace","name":"Morris-Jumel Mansion","lon":-73.938866,"id":13313142,"state":"NY","lat":40.83453,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.436668396,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459133167000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NEW FLYER WITH DETAILS ON SOME AWESOME BONUSES FOR ATTENDEES!:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/1\/e\/600_448586398.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nA haunted mansion, the oldest on Manhattan, ghost stories, and an evening of entertainment showcasing the talents of several of our members.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/b\/0\/9\/600_448307881.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nLeanna Renee Hieber is an actress, playwright, author, and TGTSNBN member, whose gothic fantasy novel Strangely Beautiful is being rereleased by a new publisher with expanded content, and a wonderful new cover.<\/p> <p>Celebrate the reissue at Manhattan's most beautiful (and haunted) historic mansion!<\/p> <p><br\/>Leanna's theatrical reading from this iconic, ghostly tale will be accompanied by a Fashion Presentation of a Strangely Beautiful inspired line, courtesy of<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Wormwood-Gall-1455709274701551\/\">Wormwood &amp; Gall<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe event also features a Costume Contest (come dressed in your best Gothic, Neo-Victorian and\/or Steampunk finery!) and the evening will wrap up with a discussion and Q and A with Leanna and MJM staff about the delightful process of using real live ghost stories in fiction and as a part of historic preservation (learn all about the Morris-Jumel Mansion's haunts!).<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Tickets are $15 at the door, all proceeds going to help keep this amazing, historic property standing for centuries to come!

Juliet Prowse portrays Nora, a deejay and hostess at a sleazy midtown discoth\u00e8que who starts to receive obscene phone calls. Nora dismisses them, until she crosses paths with Bill Madden (Jan Murray), a grim, obsessive police lieutenant specializing in sex crimes (his obsession, as he later reveals, derives from the fact that his own wife was assaulted and murdered while out alone one night); he manages both to offend and frighten Nora with his depth of knowledge and suspicions about the kinds of people who commit those crimes. They develop a close but wary relationship even as the caller, whoever he is, proves to know not only a great deal about her personal life, but also about events transpiring right inside her apartment. She goes about her life as best she can, attending auditions and making the rounds of theaters, and socializing with her co-workers at the club, including the bus boy, Larry (Sal Mineo), who seems lonely and has a very sweet younger sister who is mildly retarded, and the club manager (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/elaine-stritch-p68342\">Elaine Stritch<\/a>).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C2M8JKrAniE\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C2M8JKrAniE<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/230475602\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Who Killed Teddy Bear?

Try to arrive 15 minutes early so we can go live at 9:00 PM!!!\u00a0 See you Saturday!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyorklacrosse\/events\/230461490\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":5400000,"name":"Men's Lacrosse Open Play @ Pier 40","id":"bvgfslyvgbnc","time":1462064400000,"updated":1462071734000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1066858789000,"name":"New York Lacrosse Club","group_lon":-74,"id":93155,"urlname":"newyorklacrosse","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"NYC Laxers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Totowa","address_1":"1 Us Highway 46","name":"ruby lounge totowa","lon":-74.222054,"id":23833994,"lat":40.891842,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.6287164688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461950422000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0Admission $10\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Guest list special $5 call \/text[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/b\/600_449283531.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Formally known as Docs","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mix-It-Up-Nights-Dancing-Meetup\/events\/230747013\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Get Ready to Dance, Dance and Dance...It'\u00ads Saturday Night @ Ruby Lounge!!!!","id":"230747013","time":1462064400000,"updated":1462077140000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432930496000,"name":"Mix It Up Nights Dancing Meetup","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":18635000,"urlname":"Mix-It-Up-Nights-Dancing-Meetup","group_lat":40.9000015259,"who":"dance and social friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Totowa","address_1":"1 Us Highway 46","name":"ruby lounge totowa","lon":-74.222054,"id":23833994,"lat":40.891842,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":15.6287164688,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461026034000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":2},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u2022\u00a0Admission $10\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Guest list special $5 call \/text[masked]<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/b\/600_449283531.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Formally known as Docs","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Mix-It-Up-Nights-Dancing-Meetup\/events\/230477819\/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"name":"Get Ready to Dance, Dance and Dance...It'\u00ads Saturday Night @ Ruby Lounge!!!!","id":"230477819","time":1462064400000,"updated":1462107235000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1432930496000,"name":"Mix It Up Nights Dancing Meetup","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":18635000,"urlname":"Mix-It-Up-Nights-Dancing-Meetup","group_lat":40.9000015259,"who":"dance and social friends"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"","method":"OpenEvents","total_count":9527,"link":"https:\/\/api.meetup.com\/2\/open_events","count":725,"description":"Searches for recent and upcoming public events hosted by Meetup groups.
