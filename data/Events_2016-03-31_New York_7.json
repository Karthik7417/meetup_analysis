Purchase both at the same time and pay only $20 for the night!<\/p> <p>****************************************************************************<\/p> <p><b>Volunteers get in for\u00a0FREE!<br\/><\/b>Email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>\u00a0to inquire about volunteer opportunities.<\/p> <p>Stay informed:\u00a0<b><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/fGoUk\">join our mailing list<\/a>!<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/friday-night-blues-new-york-3\"><b>Friday Night Blues NYC is on Yelp!<\/b><\/a>\u00a0If you enjoy our event, please consider leaving us a review.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/www.fridaynightblues.nyc\/about\/locations","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Friday-Night-Blues-NYC\/events\/229397823\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":16200000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","id":"zxkmqlyvfbxb","time":1458347400000,"updated":1458364494000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1446516679000,"name":"Friday Night Blues NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19085086,"urlname":"Friday-Night-Blues-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Dancers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"265 West 72nd Street","name":"World Yoga Center","lon":-73.983866,"id":1312825,"state":"NY","lat":40.779866,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.09254765511,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457271419000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and join us for an evening of fun and TurnOn. How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in NYC?<\/p> <p>We play 3 communication game (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:40p.

Gertrude\u2019s Nose looks like the prow of a great ship, with massive blocks of fallen rock below.\u00a0 From the peak, you have stunning views of The Catskill Mountains to the north and the Hudson Valley to the east.<\/p> <p>But the fun does not stop there!\u00a0 Rather then walking right over the surface of this natural beauty we will get down and dirty doing whatever it takes to reach the bottom and fully explore the numerous crevices interlaced throughout Gertrude's Nose. (That's right folks - I'm bringing the webbing!)<\/p> <p>Finally we will complete our hike through dense hemlock forest and over streams as we marvel at the crags and crevasses of the Shawangunk Ridge.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/c\/600_440824460.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>WHERE TO MEET?<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/41%C2%B043%2743.9%22N+74%C2%B014%2714.1%22W\/@41.7284176,-74.2367183,298m\/data=%213m1%211e3%214m2%213m1%211s0x0:0x0\">WE WILL START AT THE UPPER PARKING AREA ADJACENT TO LAKE MINNEWASKA ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRANCE GATE.<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b>\u00a0 approx 8 miles<\/p> <p><b>Hiking Pace:<\/b>\u00a0 Up to 2.0 mph - In the Crevices it will be Slow but physically challenging<\/p> <p><b>Estimated Hike Time:<\/b>\u00a0 7 hours<\/p> <p><b>Difficulty:<\/b>\u00a0 Advanced Beginner\/Intermediate - Rocky Terrain and Crevices with possible exposures - I will bring a 50 ft. handline to help navigate any hard terrain.<\/p> <p><b>Current Weather Forecast:<\/b> Partly Sunny with a high of 48 Degrees\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Fee:<\/b> $10. per car<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/7\/7\/600_440824471.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>RECOMMENDED GEAR:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>\u2022<\/b> <b>Raincoat\/Windbreaker<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Hiking Poles<\/b> (if desired)<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 \"Scrambling\" Gloves<\/b> - Lightweight with good grip - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/West-Chester-Latex-Gripper-Knit-Glove-HD30501-SHSP36\/100398993?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-100398989-_-100398993-_-N\">Gardening gloves from Home Depot work great!<\/a><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Shoes with good grip<\/b> - preferably with ankle support<\/p> <p><b>\u2022 Headlamp with spare batteries<\/b> - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/t\/202968174?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=rayovac&amp;storeId=10051&amp;N=5yc1v&amp;R=202968174#.UWDkcVfzBQg\">Home Depot has a great 100 lumen headlamp for only $12.99!<\/a><\/p> <p><b>\u2022 A Small Pack<\/b> - nothing too large that will become a hindrance in the scrambles<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Related maps<\/b>, a <b>Compass<\/b> or <b>GPS<\/b>, <b>Water<\/b>, <b>Snacks<\/b>, <b>First Aid<\/b>, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/a\/b\/600_440824523.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/c\/c\/600_440824556.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i><b>RELATED MAPS:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nynjtc.org\/product\/shawangunk-trails\">New York - New Jersey Trail Conference - Shawangunk Trails Map Set<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/b\/e\/600_440824542.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/e\/0\/600_440824576.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Afterwards feel free to join us for some food and drink at a venue to be decided in the New Paltz area.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><i><b><br\/><\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>**HEAVY RAIN WILL CANCEL THIS EVENT**<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><i><b>NYC HIKING &amp; OUTDOOR ADVENTURE GROUP LEGAL DISCLAIMER<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Waiver of liability<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>You agree when you sign up for this group or any of the events that you have read and understand the below.<\/p> <p>If you join us for a hike (or any other event), please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness and well-being and will hold no one else liable in case of injury or mishap.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p>We'll play 3 simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with goals. There will be 6 teams on the field and we will play three games, 30 minutes\/game. Every 30 minutes we will have a short break and teams will switch to play against different team. Please check your email or our meetup message board on friday night or before 12.00pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>[img src=\"<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/>\"&gt;<\/p> <p><b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe's life is ever the same. Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran--and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home, after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder. As Joe writes about Carl's life, especially Carl's valor in Vietnam, he cannot reconcile the heroism of the soldier with the despicable acts of the convict. Joe, along with his skeptical female neighbor, throws himself into uncovering the truth, but he is hamstrung in his efforts by having to deal with his dangerously dysfunctional mother, the guilt of leaving his autistic brother vulnerable, and a haunting childhood memory. Thread by thread, Joe unravels the tapestry of Carl\u2019s conviction. But as he and Lila dig deeper into the circumstances of the crime, the stakes grow higher. Will Joe discover the truth before it\u2019s too late to escape the fallout?<\/p> <p>I look forward to seeing you all at March's event!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s\/events\/228555261\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"March Book Club Brunch","id":"228555261","time":1458397800000,"updated":1458749366000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1400015507000,"name":"Girl Friends near Millburn\/Cranford NJ (late 20's - 30's)","group_lon":-74.3000030518,"id":14438052,"urlname":"Meet-Girl-Friends-near-Millburn-NJ-late-20s-mid-30s","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07103","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"777 1st Avenue, East 44th Street","name":"Church Center of the United Nations","lon":-74.197952,"id":11967042,"state":"NY","lat":40.73127,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.985326767,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456780009000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Behind the historical silence of missing women and girls, forgotten by society.

If you are excited to sign up for a season of Tinkergarten, our trial class will give you the chance to see, first hand, what a class feels like and how we inspire authentic, play-based learning for children (and a great time for all)! This free trial class is designed to be the first class in the Spring season of Tinkergarten. This class is designed for children 18 months through five years old and a treasured adult.<\/p> <p>Tinkergarten classes are based on a progressive curriculum comprised of our blueprint activities. The curriculum for each class is tailored to the ages and prior knowledge of kids, and are appropriate for the geographic region and season of the class. Leaders further tailor classes to meet the needs of the individuals and artfully facilitate the activity to maximize the fun and the learning for all involved. Below is a sampling of the types of activities to expect in this class.<\/p> <p><br\/>SAMPLE ACTIVITY - MAGIC PETAL POTIONS<br\/>Skills: Creativity, Imagination, Behavioral Schema, Sensory<br\/>For petal potions, kids put water and anything from nature into a jar and mix it up, just like we did when we were kids. Making potions never gets old, and if done with some finesse, it helps kids develop creativity, imagination, sensory skills and several universal ways to encourage brain development known as behavioral schema. Although we call it magic \u201cpetal potion,\u201d you can make magic potion anytime of year with any natural ingredients.<\/p> <p>SAMPLE ACTIVITY - KINGS AND QUEENS OF WILD THINGS<br\/>Skills: Creativity, Imagination, Behavioral Schema, Fine Motor, Self Esteem<br\/>Combine the magic of Maurice Sendak's \"Wild Things\" with the power of double-sided tape to turn a day outdoors into a brain-boosting, unforgettable, wild rumpus!<\/p> <p><b>SPACE IS LIMITED.

ABOUT THE SHOW:<\/p> <p>Following up on their blockbuster \"Dino-Light\" show, Lightwire Theater presents a musical glow-in-the-dark adventure tale that celebrates differences. Marvin the mouse craves popularity, but the \u201ccool\u201d rats think he\u2019s just a nerd. To escape their taunts, he dives into a world of fantasy where he flies to the moon on a homemade rocket, meets a cast of misfit creatures, and learns a valuable lesson about celebrating difference. But most of the fun comes from Lightwire Theatre\u2019s eye-popping visuals, in which puppets that are seemingly drawn on a darkened stage with electroluminescent wire take on personalities as vibrant and inspiring as their exteriors<\/p> <p>\n\n\nLUNCH AT BIG DADDY'S:<\/p> <p>Nearby family-friendly restaurant Big Daddy's (2454 Broadway, at 91st - <a href=\"http:\/\/bigdaddysnyc.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bigdaddysnyc.com<\/a>) offers FTUWS Moms Meetup 20 percent off all meal purchases on Saturday, March 19th.

First of all, thank you to all who attended our past \"Werewolf In the Park\" events, they've been great! For everyone else, it's never to late to get in on the fun -come one, come all, and tell your friends as well.<\/p> <p>On Saturday, March 19th, we'll be returning to the event that is not unfamiliar to some of our members: Ultimate Werewolf.\u00a0 Due to the possibility of cold weather, we'll be holding the event at the OSA Community Center -which we've used for a few of our other, general game days.\u00a0 Ultimate Werewolf is a social game in which players are randomly assigned to one of two (or possibly more) teams: the villagers or the werewolves. The villagers must deduce who the werewolves are over a series of rounds using various techniques and social intrigue; this must be done before the werewolves are able to eliminate the villagers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Ultimate Werewolf, check out Tom Vasel's review at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kr1ZyYycUdQ<\/a><\/p> <p>Ultimate Werewolf is the perfect game for beginners and veterans alike! All you need is the game (which I will supply) and the willingness to communicate with others. Also, if you do not know how to play Ultimate Werewolf, never fear, it is quite simple and several of us will be able to teach it to you within minutes; don't let that hold you back! We'll be meeting at the OSA (Our Savior's Atonement) Community Center.\u00a0 Enter on the Southern end of the building (left as you look at it) and take the stairs to the second floor.<\/p> <p>Please note: while OSA is a Lutheran church, our group has no religious affiliation; we are renting the Community Center purely for purposes of table-top gaming.\u00a0 Also, Because we are renting this community center, I must collect a fee of 8 dollars to cover the expenses.<\/p> <p>Space is limited, so please DO NOT RSVP UNLESS YOU ARE FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT YOU CAN ATTEND!<\/p> <p><br\/>OSA is located between the 181st street and 190th street lower-street level stops of the A-train; it is also very close to the 191st street stop of the 1-train. We hope to see you there! Message me if you need more information. Beginners and experts welcome<\/p> <p><br\/>So bring along some snacks and (non- alcoholic) beverages (if you'd like) and prepare for an afternoon of team-deduction and social intrigue.\u00a0 Hopefully you will not end up as the werewolf's next meal!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-NYC-Board-Gamers\/events\/229074095\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":14400000,"name":"Ultimate Werewolf at OSA!

We'll have some up-to-date information and ways to take immediate action so that YOU can make a difference.<\/p> <p><b>About the Movie<\/b><br\/>\u201cIn the spring of 2005, acclaimed environmental photographer James Balog headed to the Arctic on a tricky assignment for National Geographic: to capture images to help tell the story of the Earth\u2019s changing climate. Even with a scientific upbringing, Balog had been a skeptic about climate change. But that first trip north opened his eyes to the biggest story in human history and sparked a challenge within him that would put his career and his very well-being at risk\u2026.<\/p> <p>With a band of young adventurers in tow, Balog began deploying revolutionary time-lapse cameras across the brutal Arctic to capture a multi-year record of the world\u2019s changing glaciers. His hauntingly beautiful videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. Chasing Ice depicts a photographer trying to deliver evidence and hope to our carbon-powered planet.\u201d<\/p> <p><b>Discussion After the Movie<\/b><br\/>Dr. Debra Tillinger will bring us up to date on the latest information regarding ice-melt and sea level rise and lead a discussion. Dr Tillinger has spoken at one of our general meetings and she is a great presenter, so we're glad she's available to talk about the film after the showing. She teaches a course on climate change science at the AMNH.

The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie.

On view from March 18 to August 7, 2016, the exhibition explores Isaac Mizrahi\u2019s unique position at the intersection of high style and popular culture. While best known for his clothing designs, Mizrahi\u2019s creativity has expanded over a nearly three decade career to embrace acting, directing, set and costume design, writing, and cabaret performance. Spanning his first collection in 1988 to the present day,\u00a0An Unruly History\u00a0weaves together the many threads of his prolific career, juxtaposing work in fashion, film, television, and the performing arts.<\/p> <p><br\/>Isaac Mizrahi\u2019s inventive and provocative style advances complex issues within the fashion arena, igniting a spirited discourse about high versus low, modern glamour, and contemporary culture. For example, his runway shows were cast with unconventionally beautiful models of all ethnicities dressed in Star of David belts, Western-wear infused handmade lace, Adidas sneakers in place of high heels, handbags worn as hats, or humble cotton undershirts paired with floor-length taffeta skirts. Uniting opposites is a Mizrahi signature, which arises in his many combinations of evening and sportswear, formal and casual, and couture and mass market.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/6\/1\/3\/600_447950707.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Isaac Mizrahi: An Unruly History\u00a0is organized thematically, exploring key trends in Mizrahi\u2019s work \u2014 from the use of color and prints, to witty designs that touch on issues of race, religion, class, and politics. The core of the exhibition features iconic designs from the Isaac Mizrahi New York clothing label (1987 \u2013 1998), the \u201csemi-couture\u201d collections (2003 \u2013 2011), and the trailblazing line for Target (2002 \u2013 2008). The show is comprised of 42 \u201clooks\u201d that include clothing, hats, jewelry, shoes, accessories, and costumes for the theater, the opera, and the Mark Morris Dance Group. Also featured are the designer\u2019s original drawings, performance stills, and behind-the-scenes photographs. A bespoke multi-screen video installation showcases a variety of content drawn from film and television cameos and runway shows, as well as from the award-winning documentary\u00a0Unzipped; the television program The Isaac Mizrahi Show; scenes from the cabaret\u00a0LES MIZrahi; appearances on\u00a0Project Runway; and the current QVC network show\u00a0IsaacMizrahiLive!.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will be holding the meetup sign at the front of the museum that says \"MY NEW FRIENDS\"","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/My_New_Friends\/events\/229692154\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"**SHORT NOTICE - Free Admission - Isaac Mizrahi's \"An Unruly History\" exhibition","id":"229692154","time":1458410400000,"updated":1458495368000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1400194011000,"name":"!

To truly be open to Spring's potential, we have to be willing to let go of our old insecurities to step into something new. We all feel ready for Spring, but are we really open to the transformation that comes with it? We tend to cling to these old patterns because they feel safe compared to the unknown.<\/p> <p>Join Lorraine Goldbloom as she facilitates a free group healing to help let go of insecurity. Insecurity is a universal issue, and it prevents us from realizing our full potential. This healing will focus on re-patterning, balancing and harmonizing the system to help open your system to the new possibilities that come with Spring.<\/p> <p><i>VortexHealing\u00ae is an extraordinary healing modality that works through consciousness and matter.

From April 11th to April 16th over two thousand people will participate in a mass sit-in to get money out if politics by getting Congress to take urgent action. If you're interested in signing up for this mass civil disobedience, you can do so here.<\/p> <p>We want to ensure that everyone, no matter their socio-economic class, is able to participate in the march and\/or sit in. That's why on March 19th from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. we are going to have an Open Mic Fundraiser at the NY Society for Ethical Culture. Tickets are $10.00 online or $10.00 cash at the door. This will be a great chance to meet other activists, artists, and people interested in getting money out of politics.

Continue south on the right side. Jersey City has a greenway plan for the Morris Canal with a map that can be viewed here: <a href=\"http:\/\/morriscanaljc.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/techmemo2_revised_10-18-12.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/morriscanaljc.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/techmemo2_revised_10-18-12.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/morriscanaljc.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/techmemo2_revised_10-18-12.pdf<\/a><\/a><br\/>109.00 Just past where Clendenny Ave turns left away from Rt 440 on the opposite side is about where the Morris Canal came out to run parallel or on what is now Rt 440. Continue south on 440, the former canal route. Pass retail buildings and a jughandle.<br\/>109.15 Just after the jughandle, cross Rt 440 on a crosswalk directly over both north and southbound lanes. Turn right, continuing south parallel with Rt 440. Pass more industry and retail.<br\/>109.30 Shortly after crossing Clark Ave, and passing a building near to the road on the left, a large parking area which is almost like a side road follows Rt 440 on the left. This may have been the route of the Morris Canal, or a prior main road route next to the canal. Follow it south near to 440.<br\/>Pass Water Street and through more parking areas keeping to the left of 440.<br\/>109.52 Cross Culver Ave continuing south.<br\/>109.65 Large open parking ara on the left. Continue parallel with 440.<br\/>109.80 Cross entrance to a large box store and continue on a nice newer sidewalk.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xlf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/10469201_902428849793654_1854735185208929438_n.jpg?oh=33d35bae329997a6febcc377b1eb6355&amp;oe=573BAA55\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xlf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/10469201_902428849793654_1854735185208929438_n.jpg?oh=33d35bae329997a6febcc377b1eb6355&amp;oe=573BAA55<\/a><\/p> <p>109.95 Another box store entrance. Continue south and soon return to a sidewalk closer to Rt 440. Large building to the left, followed by car and truck lots.<br\/>110.26 Reach the diagonal intersection with Danforth Ave. Continue to cross the crosswalk over Danforth. At the intersection, walk behind a small eatery with Danforth Avenue slowly moving off to the left, while Rt 440 is slowly moving off to the right. The former Morris Canal route passes directly behind the eatery. Head in a straight line to the end of the pavement.<br\/>110.36 Reach the end of the pavement. The former canal is recognizable and easily walkable as an undeveloped strip between retail and residential areas. Soon, Sullivan Drive parallels the greenway. Follow the former canal trail south.<br\/>110.55 A line of parking spots is along Sullivan Drive to the left, parallel with the canal route. Continue along the former canal on the grass.<br\/>110.65 Reach and cross Batholdi Ave along the old canal route. Continue on the greenway between houses heading south.<br\/>110.75 Cross Mina Drive on the former canal route, after shortly pralleling Sayles Street. Pass between more homes in a very pleasantly surprising section of canal greenway. It is wonderful that such a nice section of the canal greenway has been preserved in Jersey City.<br\/>110.92 Cross a sidewalk which leads left to Gates Avenue or right to Sycamore Road. The canal greenway can be followed a short distance ahead, but when scouted, it led to a chain link fence that was extremely difficult to get over, and required backtracking anyway. Hikers should turn right on the sidewalk to Sycamore Road and turn left, parallel with the park (name of park???).<br\/>111.08 Reach the end of the park along Sycamore Road. Continue on the road ahead through residential area.<br\/>111.15 Reach West 63rd Street and turn left.<br\/>111.20 Eatery on the left, the canal passed directly behind it, partially through the parking lot. Continue ahead along the road.<br\/>111.30 Reach John F. Kennedy Blvd. Turn around, and look at the parking lot behind. It is apparent where the canal was up to this point. Perhaps in the near future this will be a continueous route. Cross over JFK on the crosswalk, and continue on Morris Canal trail sidewalk. The canal route is a fenced in greenway to the right, and is quite nice, parallel with city park (name???).<br\/>111.39 Reach Ruby Brown Terrace and turn right. The canal greenway continues next to the sidewalk along the road to the right.<br\/>111.44 Parking area on the right, built on the former canal.<br\/>111.48 At the intersection to Merrit Street, look straight ahead. The Morris Canal continued under the railroad tracks here, and the bridge is still in place. Unfortunately, it is badly overgrown, and beyond there is no good way under Rt 78. Turn left and follow Merrit Street.<br\/>111.62 Turn left from Merrit Street onto Avenue Cut and pass beneath the railroad tracks and Rt 78.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11070553_902429966460209_6680502407107871787_n.jpg?oh=eab5fa6c155f288a8dd63e4ebff99d68&amp;oe=576CDB91\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11070553_902429966460209_6680502407107871787_n.jpg?oh=eab5fa6c155f288a8dd63e4ebff99d68&amp;oe=576CDB91<\/a><\/p> <p>111.75 After reaching the south side of the Rt 78 underpass, note the gated former canal on the right, parallel with the highway. The canal route continues ahead to the left across a wide parking lot. Turn left to cross Avenue C and follow the canal route across the parking lot. A building is built over the historic route ahead, but pass around it to the right, then turn slightly left again to come to the intersectin of Broadway and 55th Street.<br\/>11.95 Intersection of Broadway and 55th Street. Carefully cross Broadway, then diagonally follow the canal route which is the right side of a parking lot continuing generally in the direction it has been travelling to the southeast.<br\/>112.07 After passing slightly to the right of a large box store, come to a small field of short pieces of utility poles. These exist at several locations for the purpose of testing different woods for these poles.<br\/>This unfortunately is the farthest south one can reasonably walk along the canal route. The canal made this sweeping south to north turn in order to negotiate the lower end of Bergen Hill, the southern terminus of the igneus intrusive basalt formation of the Palisades. The northern terminus is in NY wester of Haverstraw where the formation once again dips beneath the surface of the Earth. Turn around and head back to Garfield Ave at the start of the parking area, and turn right to pass beneath Rt 78 again.<br\/>For those who do not wish to do the long road walk, it is possible to hike south a bit further to the corner of Center Street and Avenue E to take a light rail train on or near the old canal route to the north and skip the following section. The station has Morris Canal signage stating the canal passed \"near\" here.<br\/>112.50 After passing beneath the railroad overpass, reach Catherine Court and cross it. This route can be followed to Princeton Ave, then to Cator Ave to be closer to the former canal route, but there are no remnants to see. It is better to remain on Garfield.<br\/>113.07 Pass Cator Ave on the right. There is a cemetery a block down Cater, off of Princeton Ave which has at times been open, and is very nice to walk through. It more closely parallels the railroad tracks and therefore the canal route as well, however cemeteries in urbanized areas such as this one tend to be locked at all but one entrance more often than not. It is likely that it will be necessary to remain on Garfield Ave northeast.<br\/>113.12 Willard Street enters the cemetery on the right. The expansive cemetery occupies both sides of the road making for a much nicer walking experience for some time.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/1977114_902431603126712_3341558900992828982_n.jpg?oh=b15c60fbaec9defce46d0e3b1a0583dc&amp;oe=576ECC7B\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/1977114_902431603126712_3341558900992828982_n.jpg?oh=b15c60fbaec9defce46d0e3b1a0583dc&amp;oe=576ECC7B<\/a><\/p> <p>113.47 Reach a park entrance road and parallel path to the right. Turn here, cross the entrance road on a path, and continue to the right parallel with the entrance road. Soon, cross the road once more and continue east northeast through the park on one of two parallel concrete pathways with intersection pathways between them. The canal was just off to the right beyond the railroad tracks on the south side of the park.<br\/>113.71 The paths converge and reach Richard Street. Turn left and head back out to Garfield Ave, then turn right to continue on Garfield once more.<br\/>114.0 Bayview Ave is on the right. A short walk down Bayview will lead to a swath of woods and trees over which a bridge crosses. This is the former canal route, though it is inaccessible at this point. Continue on Garfield.<br\/>114.31 Cross Caven Point Road and continue on Garfield. A block down Caven Point, at the intersection with Halladay Street, the canal crossed. There are very little remnants to see if any.<br\/>114.50 Carteret Ave on the right. The canal crossed this road as well. Some of the historic route makes up access roads through the industrial sites, but they are inaccessible to pedestrians at this time.<br\/>114.65 Pass beneath railroad tracks on Carteret (rail history???)<br\/>115.0 Reach the intersection with Communipaw Ave. There are possible opportunities for better re-routes in the near future on this section with the availability of the historic canal route due to intelligent development. We will try to update this guide as the better routes become available.<br\/>Turn right on Communipaw. The canal crossed at the intersection with Berry Lane on the right. Continue on Communipaw.<br\/>115.14 Turn left on Manning Ave<br\/>115.22 Reach the intersection with Lafayette Street. Cross diagonally to the right a bit, and continue along the north side of a park (park name???)<br\/>A development to the left bears the name \"Canal Circle\". The canal passed through the north side of the small community.<br\/>115.31 Reach Maple Street and turn right, remaining on the park path.<br\/>115.40 Reach Van Horne Street and turn left. Follow the road out and across Johnson Ave to where there is a vacant lot to the left.<br\/>115.53 Turn right on Carbon Street, which follows the historic route of the canal.<br\/>115.60 Reach and cross Halladay Street on an angle. Turn left slightly, then right onto a concrete path between buildings on the historic canal route.<br\/>115.68 Reach Pacific Ave in front of a through style truss railroad bridge. Note the width of the bridge is enough for both road and former canal to pass beneath. Turn left on Pacific Ave and pass beneath Rt 78. The canal headed due east, but is inaccessible here.<br\/>115.84 Reach Grand Street and turn right, across Pacific Ave eastbound.<br\/>115.97 Reach and turn right on Monmouth Street and parallel a sub station (electric) to the right.<br\/>116.04 After crossing an entrance road with a median on the left, cross a parking lot ahead. Enter the parking lot, not the parallel road to the right, and follow the lot to the south end. The south side of the lot is the former canal. Turn left at the end of the lot. The road exiting is called Canal Street.<br\/>116.20 Reach Varick Street, a parallel road next to Jersey Avenue. From here, two alternatives diverge. To the right, the Liberty-Water Gap Trail route leads down Jersey Ave to a foot bridge over the west end of the Morris Canal Big Basin (note that the foot bridge was destroyed during Tropical Storm Sandy in 2012 and may be closed for some time). Hikers can then follow paths parallel to Audrey Zapp Drive out to the Central Railroad of NJ terminal on the south side of the Morris Canal Big Basin, a little over a mile beyond depending on which route is taken.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11391550_902432753126597_2504165647734956113_n.jpg?oh=07d9d92b76bf05ca71895e62173ce2e0&amp;oe=57292AED\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/11391550_902432753126597_2504165647734956113_n.jpg?oh=07d9d92b76bf05ca71895e62173ce2e0&amp;oe=57292AED<\/a><\/p> <p>This guide will follow the main historic canal route as closely as possible.<br\/>Cross Jersey Avenue on a cross walk and pass the Jersey City Light Rail station on the right. Continue ahead through th eparking area and along Regent Street.<br\/>116.42 At the end of Regent Street, turn right on Tidewater Street. Go one block, then turn left closely parallel with the light rail tracks.<br\/>116.60 Reach Marin Blvd. Turn right briefly, then cross on a crosswalk, and follow along south side of the light rail tracks. If there is not an open greenway here on the south side of the tracks, continue to the nearest block and head east to Van Vorst Street, south to the railroad crossing. From Van Vorst Street, head to the north side of the light rail tracks and follow Essex Street east, still parallel with the tracks. It is also possible to head south to Dudley Street and head east. Either way, hikers will need to head one block south to Dudley Street at their discretion, OR head south on Van Vorst to the Waterfront Walkway along the north side of Morris Canal Big Basin.<br\/>116.96 Morris Canal Little Basin is at the intersection of Dudley Street and ????????????????.

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/229565336\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvfbbc","time":1458478800000,"updated":1458490770000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456090587000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i> (MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

Take the path leading into central park, and go left (up the slope) until you get to the clearing at the top of the hill. If it's rainy or bad weather, I won't be there, but if the suns out, you can find me under the hill. I will let the group know ahead of time if I have to cancel in advance. The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together. Look forward to seeing all of you!<\/p> <p>This meditation is free.

(Each person pays $1 cash at the meetings, just to help offset the costs of having the group hosted here on MeetUp.com.)<\/p> <p>Every week, we meet from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. Usually, we work through Julia Cameron's creativity building techniques (for example those in The Artist's Way and The Prosperous Heart). We start each session discussing the current week's activity (morning pages, artist's dates, synchronicities, creative endeavors, etc) and then participate in an agreed upon exercise\/task (bring paper and pen please).<\/p> <p><br\/>Normally, on the third Sunday of the month, we share our artistic projects in a kind of \"Show &amp; Tell\" so that we can get to know each other's work and support it.

Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of \u201crace,\u201d a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men\u2014bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<\/p> <p><i>Between the World and Me\u00a0<\/i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son\u2014and readers\u2014the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children\u2019s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage,\u00a0<i>Between the World and Me\u00a0<\/i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n***Where to Find the Book***<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates\/dp\/0812993543\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451426797&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=between+the+world+and+me\">Amazon<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/between-the-world-and-me-ta-nehisi-coates\/1121816158?ean=9780812993547\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/brooklyn.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/11876493062906_between_the_world_and_me\">Brooklyn Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huemanbookstore.com\/book\/9780812993547\">Hue-Man Bookstore<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/browse.nypl.org\/iii\/encore\/record\/C__Rb20728940__Sbetween%20the%20world%20and%20me__Orightresult__U__X7?lang=eng&amp;suite=def\">New York Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.npl.org\/search~S1?\/Xbetween+the+world+and+me&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=D\/Xbetween+the+world+and+me&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=between+the+world+and+me\/1%2C93%2C93%2CB\/frameset&amp;FF=Xbetween+the+world+and+me&amp;searchscope=1&amp;SORT=D&amp;1%2C1%2C\">Newark Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.queenslibrary.org\/node\/1879272\">Queens Public Library<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sistersuptownbookstore.com\/\">Sisters Uptown Bookstore<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club\/events\/227702815\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"\"Between the World and Me\" by Ta-Nehisi Coates","id":"227702815","time":1458489600000,"updated":1458507414000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1228498177000,"name":"Uptown Girl's Harlem Book Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1333170,"urlname":"Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Uptown Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07010","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Cliffside Park","address_1":"639 Anderson Avenue","name":"Shine Yoga Center","lon":-73.988136,"id":11591702,"state":"NJ","lat":40.825199,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.20712757111,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456092565000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us on Saturday, March 19th for 2 hrs of community, networking, learning &amp; a lively discussion about marketing basics for holistic women in business.<\/p> <p>BUY TICKETS NOW<\/p> <p>Knowing how to write &amp; talk about what you do is surprisingly challenging for entrepreneurs, especially for holistic women who offer services that help so many different areas of life &amp; business.

As most may or may not know, Mark will be leaving New Jersey for Seattle on the 26th, so once again we decided to open up this shoot to the public to enjoy on final shoot with new and old friends alike. This time around we have newcomers to the group, Stacy Winters and Kelly Larsen. We welcome them to the group and we're happy to have them be a part of the lineup. We also have returning beauty, Louise Ann who made a memorable impression on us all last time and looking forward to having her back for another amazing shoot.<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>This shoot will follow a free form style much like the group's usual Model Spotlight format. 3 looks from each model. (4th look pending time) Every shooter will have a certain amount of time with the model for each look so they can direct and have a mini one on one type of shooting experience. Weather permitting, we'll get to shoot outdoors in groups with the free form style and take advantage of the outdoor setting. Indoors, we'll have setups ready for the models to shoot in. (Strobe and LED lighting.)<\/p> <p><b>What to bring:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this shoot, feel free to bring your speed lights with your preferred modifiers, if you wish. There will be lighting setup at certain stations for the three models but if you are opting to shoot, lets say outdoors or a location that doesn't have lighting during your time to shoot then your speed light will be more convenient for portability.<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p>Deposit is required to secure a spot and also to have the financials in order for the models.

(Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please Meetup message me or email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/229361936\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"Mark G.

He\u2019s not a child at all, but somewhere in his mid-30s, which can seem light-years away for a woman who has been\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/07\/02\/magazine\/in-language-a-woman-of-a-certain-age.html\">of a certain age\u00a0<\/a>for decades. So when he jostles Doris (Sally Field), she braces for the usual morning-elevator scrum. Instead, he straightens her lopsided eyeglasses. With this one small, human kindness he does something that astonishes Doris, something that doesn\u2019t often happen to the world\u2019s invisible women: He sees her.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/d\/d\/600_447794557.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Not that Doris, who\u2019s in her 60s, tries to be invisible, exactly. From her cat-eye glasses to the headscarves that make her look hastily regifted, she seems like someone yearning to be seen. But wrinkles have a way of making women disappear one crease at a time, and Doris, who\u2019s in mourning when the movie opens, has done her part to vanish. When this kid \u2014 he turns out to be a new co-worker, John (Max Greenfield, an effortless charmer) \u2014 notices Doris, it changes everything. Doris is more than just surprised by his attention, she is also transformed. He makes her visible, most importantly to herself, a revelation that turns Doris into a woman who desires and is desired in turn. It\u2019s a ferocious awakening.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s also a fairly slow, gaudy bloom. Like his heroine, the director\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/movies.nytimes.com\/person\/269365\/Michael-Showalter?inline=nyt-per\">Michael Showalter<\/a>\u00a0eagerly oversells the goods. Right off, he throws in a lot that\u2019s hard on the eyes and ears. There\u2019s Doris\u2019s dowager-dumpster wardrobe and topsy-turvy Staten Island house, along with her mutterings and facial contortions, which seem one tic away from a medical diagnosis. As he puts these messy parts into play, I kept thinking no, no, no, no. It\u2019s all much too much (those shoes, that hair!) and together they announce that you\u2019re in for an ingratiatingly cutesy slog about a lovable kook \u2014 except that the movie and Doris aren\u2019t easy to love, which is partly why they work.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/8\/f\/e\/600_447794590.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Kindly pay the $3.00 event\u00a0fee to Paypal before you RSVP -this is to maintain the monthly Meet Up\u00a0Fee, the printing costs, \u00a0&amp; group costs, Thank you. If you don't have Paypal, just scroll down to the prompt\u00a0and pay with a credit or debit card.\u00a0 Much appreciated.<\/b><\/p> <p>The movie starts big and broad at the funeral for Doris\u2019s mother, where everyone is shedding stage tears. Seated pointedly alone, Doris looks ashen enough that she wouldn\u2019t be out of place next to Mom in the open coffin. The whole thing is as dire as the priest\u2019s eulogy, but a few beats later, when Doris\u2019s brother, Todd (the great character actor Stephen Root), speaks to her with unforced feeling, the movie shifts into something more complex. Mr. Showalter continues to play with comic tone and mood \u2014 he folds in some slapstick, enables the mugging and stages several cringing fantasy sequences that encourage you to laugh at Doris. It feels cruel, specifically because she isn\u2019t an ordinary American movie protagonist: She\u2019s an older, frumpy, lower-middle-class woman who works in a cubicle.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/9\/3\/1\/600_447794641.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Indirection can be a beautiful tool in comedy and so it is in \u201cHello, My Name Is Doris,\u201d which uses this funny, outwardly ridiculous character to tell a simple story about a love that rarely speaks its name, including in movies: that of an older woman for a much younger man. These kinds of screen stories have always been few and far between, and it\u2019s instructive, given the prevailing cultural horror of aging, that some of the more memorable ones turn on her-or-his pathology, whether it\u2019s the deranged actress in \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcm.com\/this-month\/article\/357054%7C373028\/Sunset-Blvd-.html\">Sunset Boulevard<\/a>\u201d or the traumatized boy-man in the cult film \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5mz3TkxJhPc\">Harold and Maude<\/a>.\u201d Doris has issues, mostly grief and social isolation, which Ms. Field makes movingly real with a performance that reveals its truth incrementally.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be in the lobby inside with a GG sign and a big smile!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/women-903\/events\/229556814\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Come & see, Sally Fields movie, \"Hello, my name is Doris\", Sun. 20th at 1:15pm","id":"229556814","time":1458494100000,"updated":1458518910000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1205379482000,"name":"Great Girlfriends Group ~ 45+","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1060835,"urlname":"women-903","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Great Girlfriends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"330 Seventh Avenue, 7th Floor, btwn 28th and 29th St","name":"Opera America - Board Room","lon":-73.99575,"id":24378400,"state":"NY","lat":40.749054,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":0.308668583632,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453428590000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Theme for March: \"Things that Fly\"<\/p> <p>Bring a set you'd like to build with friends*, show something interesting you've already built (or pictures), or just bring yourself!

For medical professionals, the terms can be seen as being used to determine biological dysfunctions and suggest courses of treatment. For patients, determining whether something is a \u201cdisease\u201d may guide them to seek out solutions from the medical establishment in the first place. Concepts of health and disease also seem to have normative import at both the personal and societal levels. At the personal level, these terms suggest whether or not one \u201cshould\u201d seek solutions to a purported problem at all and whether people \u201cshould\u201d be blamed for their maladies. At the societal level, labelling something as a disease can guide policy, funding, and insurance decisions.<\/p> <p><br\/>But pinning down what is \u201chealth\u201d and what is \u201cdisease\u201d in the first place can be a tricky matter. While philosophers of medicine have <a href=\"http:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/health-disease\/\">a lot to say<\/a> about this issue, during this meetup we will take a narrower but more unique approach by examining how two people with experience in medicine and the biological sciences approach these philosophical issues. The meetup will be facilitated by philosophy enthusiast and PharmD Gregory Lopez.<\/p> <p>During the first hour of this meetup, we will discuss <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1375731\/pdf\/jmedeth00266-0008.pdf\">this paper<\/a> by a respiratory clinician who takes a nominalist approach to health and disease, utilizing unique insights from his clinical experience combined with conceptual analysis to come up with a general theory of disease. He argues that the words \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d name different things at different stages of medical inquiry and understanding.<\/p> <p>During the second hour, we will discuss <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hesslow.com\/germund\/philosophy\/conce_of.pdf\">this paper<\/a> by a neuroscientist who takes a quasi-eliminativist approach. He claims that while the concepts of \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d can make sense in some circumstances, the concepts do not do as much work as philosophers of medicine think. Instead, many people much of the time could think more clearly about medical issues if they eliminated these concepts from their inquiries.<\/p> <p>To prepare for the meetup, please read the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1375731\/pdf\/jmedeth00266-0008.pdf\">two<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hesslow.com\/germund\/philosophy\/conce_of.pdf\">papers<\/a> described above.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Philosophy-in-Manhattan\/events\/228642277\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Meeting 34: What is Health and What is a Disease?","id":"228642277","time":1458496800000,"updated":1458506211000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331816087000,"name":"Philosophy-in-Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":3483322,"urlname":"Philosophy-in-Manhattan","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"106 and Central Park West","name":"Stranger's Gate ","lon":-73.975838,"id":4925692,"state":"NY","lat":40.776409,"repinned":false},"headcount":8,"distance":1.97340893745,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458074035000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Natural Movers!\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Winter is fading and it's high time we got back outside to roll in the dirt, climb some trees, run, lift, throw, or conquer whatever obstacles we find!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Come out and play!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Patrick<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll wait at the entrance, but if you come late, we'll be up around the track just up the stairs!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NaturalMovementNYC\/events\/229616465\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"Central Park Romp","id":"229616465","time":1458496800000,"updated":1459354548000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1301251667000,"name":"Natural Movement NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":1805389,"urlname":"NaturalMovementNYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Natural Moving Humans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"677 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022","name":"Microsoft Store 5th Ave.","lon":-73.975281,"id":24215127,"state":"NY","lat":40.760506,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.06059336662,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456778634000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi Conundrum!<\/p> <p>Let's get together and talk code in March!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Remember that we are language- and platform-agnostic.

Thank you for checking out our meet up! We are currently in the process of starting an Event Planning Expo business and we are currently seeking businesses who will be willing to vendor for us. Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed! Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter. We are looking for the following:\u00a0<\/p> <p>-Photographers<\/p> <p>\n\n-DJs\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n-Tent rentals\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n-Limousine rentals<\/p> <p>\n\n-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> <p>\n\n-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> <p>\n\n-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> <p>\n\n-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> <p>\n\n-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> <p>\n\n\n-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> <p>\n\n\n-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Magicians<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Animal show businesses<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Inflatable rentals<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n-Spray Art\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> <p><br\/>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun!

Historical fiction is indeed popular among us.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Willie Sutton was born in the squalid Irish slums of Brooklyn, in the first year of the twentieth century, and came of age at a time when banks were out of control. If they weren't failing outright, causing countless Americans to lose their jobs and homes, they were being propped up with emergency bailouts. Trapped in a cycle of panics, depressions and soaring unemployment, Sutton saw only one way out, only one way to win the girl of his dreams.<\/p> <p>So began the career of America's most successful bank robber. Over three decades Sutton became so good at breaking into banks, and such a master at breaking out of prisons, police called him one of the most dangerous men in New York, and the FBI put him on its first-ever Most Wanted List.<\/p> <p>But the public rooted for Sutton. He never fired a shot, after all, and his victims were merely those bloodsucking banks. When he was finally caught for good in 1952, crowds surrounded the jail and chanted his name.<\/p> <p>Blending vast research with vivid imagination, Pulitzer Prize winner J.R. Moehringer brings Willie Sutton blazing back to life. In Moehringer's retelling, it was more than poverty or rage at society that drove Sutton. It was one unforgettable woman. In all Sutton's crimes and confinements, his first love (and first accomplice) was never far from his thoughts. And when Sutton finally walked free - a surprise pardon on Christmas Eve, 1969 - he immediately set out to find her.<\/p> <p>Poignant, comic, fast-paced and fact-studded, Sutton tells a story of economic pain that feels eerily modern, while unfolding a story of doomed love that is forever timeless.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-20-something-book-club\/events\/226929721\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":7200000,"name":"\"Sutton,\" by J.R.
