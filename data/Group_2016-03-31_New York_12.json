I don't want to sound selfish or spoiled but I travel whenever I have off from work. As a teacher, my schedule for time off is built into the year (I have no control of when I have time off and I know my schedule a year in a advance). I love teaching as I know it's a job I was called to do. I've been an Early Childhood Special Education teacher for the past 6 years. I love teaching AND traveling but unfortunately, get to do the majority of it alone. Sometimes, for certain excursions or activities, it's better to go with someone. I tend to have more fun being around people. The perk of traveling alone is that you get to meet so many cool people from around the world but I wondered if there were others like me that I can travel with? I don't smoke, drink or curse and during my travels I have come to realize that I stand out, just by not doing any of the above. I get asked about it and explain that I simply have no reason to do so (I could explain Romans 12:2, but I'm not sure they'll understand.) Some respect it and many do not. So maybe there are teachers like me out there (WHERE ARE YOU?), who have the time, interest and money to travel and want to do it with like-minded individuals! Let's travel together and not be conformed to this world BUT see the beautiful world God has created!!! There's so much out there to see and I've only touched 9% of the countries in this world.

We do this by creating safe and friendly settings where people with food-related health challenges can develop and manage their own personal transition to a healthier lifestyle. We focus on preparing healthy mood-stabilizing meals from whole foods, including easy one-pot meals like soups, stews, chili, salads, and slaws. Forge new friendships and get support based on healthy living. &nbsp;The program is free to users except for the shared cost of the meal, about $15\/meeting.

Just looking to see who's interested in this sort of idea - dinner's can be held at different times, I'm a night-owl (I work evening shifts), and it's hard to find late-night meetups similar to this, so for others like me, that tend to eat\/sleep late (midnight dinners are pretty common), this would be perfect for you! BUT! There would definitely be \"normal\" dinner meetups too occasionally. If this sounds like something you're interested in, please join! I'm open to figuring out how to do this the best way, so any input is appreciated!","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":93041022,"name":"Glenn","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/highres_250325760.jpeg","photo_id":250325760,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/member_250325760.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/6\/8\/0\/thumb_250325760.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Brooklyn Cooking & a Movie Meetup","id":18955452,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Cooking-a-Movie-Meetup","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1442888546000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing","name":"Cloud Computing","id":15167},{"urlkey":"saas-software-as-a-service","name":"SaaS (Software as a Service)","id":33089},{"urlkey":"the-cloud","name":"The Cloud","id":86100},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-in-cloud","name":"Business Intelligence in Cloud","id":87886},{"urlkey":"private-cloud","name":"Private Cloud","id":88997},{"urlkey":"iaas-infrastructure-as-a-service","name":"IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)","id":107633},{"urlkey":"cloud-security","name":"Cloud Security","id":110474},{"urlkey":"building-private-cloud-with-openstack","name":"Building private cloud with OpenStack","id":140254},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing-security","name":"Cloud Computing Security","id":141165},{"urlkey":"cloud-computing-how-to-use-it-for-your-business","name":"\"Cloud Computing\" How to use it for your business","id":158625},{"urlkey":"cloud-identity","name":"Cloud Identity","id":165237},{"urlkey":"cloud-networking","name":"Cloud Networking","id":509242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-City-Cloud-Academy\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>The New York City Cloud Academy is a New York City based cloud community group.

After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages.

Technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Established companies and startups alike work hard to capitalize on these technology development to be the most competitive in the market. At the same time, global regulators struggle to understand and pass laws regarding these technologies, sometimes providing vague guidance, sometimes overly restrictive. But in every case, in any country, and for any business operations companies are required to comply with the laws. Given the rapid developments and complexity of cyber security and technology regulation, when companies get it wrong, they often face damages including fines, litigation costs, repetitional damages, incarceration and\/or shut down of operations. This forum is to help application\/platform designers, startups and established businesses alike discuss and gain a better understanding of the cyber security and technology requirements that they are facing. Anyone is welcome that is looking to understand or share advice on existing or upcoming regulations applicable to certain technologies, business operation requirements, platform design, and more. What are we discussing? This forum is created to discuss and provides assistance with the following concerns: 1.) What are the technology and cyber security requirements already in place for my product design \/ business operations? I feel like I must be missing something... 2.) I want to start \/ continue a business in a relatively new field of technology and am afraid I'll get fined or shut down before I've even come close to making it. What are the regulations and where are they headed? (e.g. How do I understand existing regulations and the trajectory of global government regulation in these developing sectors like drone\/UAV, crypto currency, machine\/artificial intelligence and more...) 3.) I know that I am required to do this one thing for my business\/product design, but I don\u2019t know how. How are other people doing it? And how do I know if I have to do it in another country? 4.) I wish I could talk to the people making the technology and cyber security laws for my industry (e.g. FinTech, HealthTech, etc...) to tell them what the tech is really like in my business, and maybe get some understanding of what they are getting at with their laws! How can I do that? ...and more. How are we meeting? Each meeting will consist of a forum providing compliance advice for a specific aspect of the technology sector (e.g. WCAG guidelines for website\/app design, payment systems compliance issues, cryptocurrency issues, etc...), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A for items to be discussed either at that meeting or answered in the following meeting. The meetings will start in November and will be held on a monthly basis. We look forward to seeing you there!

I am a father of an amazing 16 month old boy who is the center of my universe. I work Mon-Fri, dusk till dawn saving for all the wonderful things we want to provide our son with. This leaves me little time to connect with other parents and to meet other parents that share the same family focused lifestyle that we live. Now we all know how it goes...Lots of friends and going out and social time before the baby...but after the baby comes, you just don't have the time to do all of that anymore and those friends without kids seem to drift away slowly but surely...So this is the reason I am starting this group. I'm a dad who loves football (especially fantasy football and watching football on Sundays), loves going out to eat, loves dressing my son up as cute as possible to get the most people to compliment him as possible when I take him out (admit it, we all do it!). I'm looking to meetup with easy going people who will connect with the much more simplistic lifestyle of having kids but still want to meet up and have fun once every week or two. Kids are welcome for any meetups, I mean heck, that's the whole purpose I'm posting this is because we are parents! We can meet at parks, restaurants, houses, etc... Essentially wherever people feel will be best. Just a dad, looking to connect with other dads. Sunday football outings with or without the kids would definitely be a plus! :)","lon":-73.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","members":31,"name":"Forest Hills Dads Meetup","id":18967515,"state":"NY","urlname":"Forest-Hills-Dads-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dads having fun with other dads"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Island City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443214090000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"swingdancing","name":"Swing Dancing","id":3009},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"latin-dance","name":"Latin Dance","id":17993},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"dance-and-movement","name":"Dance and Movement","id":34160},{"urlkey":"salsa-classes","name":"Salsa Classes","id":44955},{"urlkey":"dancing-and-exercising-to-amazing-music","name":"Dancing and Exercising to Amazing Music","id":125187}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dance-Nightlife\/","rating":0,"description":"Looking for people to meet up to go dancing at night!

He can also place all RSVP on wait list from which the EO would pick out the final tennists before the event date.<br>As a courtesy to the EO and members on waiting list, please change RSVP well in advance. The general rule of thumb is at least 2 days before the event.<br>EO should post a self rating range on the event base on NTRP system, e.g. 1.5 - 2.5 for members to consider before RSVP.<br>EO determine cost but it must be posted on the event in advance. For amateur players, we suggest sharing the court fee and cost of new balls. To cover some intangible expenses, EO can have the liberty to charge higher than cost.<br>From time to time, the group shall organize free coaching session exclusively for the EOs.<br>Members' record showing frequent no show without cancelling will be removed from the group. Late cancellations are considered as no show. Please make sure all players who show up checkin to the meetup system.<br>Professional Coaches are welcomed to join us. Once recognized by the group organizer as a Meetup Coach, one can organize events just like any other EO and charge their own rate.<br>From time to time, the Group would organize community tennis event free to new comers in different district to promote the game.

Let's explore this important new text together from the beginning and use it as a springboard to become peaceful miracle workers. Led by CRS co-founders and ACIM Teachers\/Healers Yasuko Kasaki and Christopher Pelham, this class will begin at the beginning of the book and work its way through the text week by week. It may be astonishing to hear that there is a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of A Course in Miracles, but it is true. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love. Jesus himself referred to what he was dictating as a \u201ccontinuation of A Course in Miracles.\u201d Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. A COURSE OF LOVE builds upon the same non-dualistic thought system as ACIM, yet it is a course for the heart. ACOL and ACIM work hand-in-hand. Yet remarkably, ACOL bypasses the mind. It uses thought to go beyond thought. Those yearning to access the heart\u2019s knowing will find help here. This is your invitation to live the purposeful, meaningful life of the new\u2014the reality of heaven on earth. Classes are $20 and class cards are available. Students of all experience levels and backgrounds are welcome! Yasuko Kasaki has been teaching A Course in Miracles and offering spiritual counseling and healing since 1999. She has approximately 1,000 students and clients. In 2004, she opened CRS, the first and only spiritual center in New York City devoted to the study and practice of ACIM. Ms. Kasaki is the author of 21 books published by major publishers in Japan. Read more... You can listen to a sampling of Yasuko's recent guided meditations here: http:\/\/crsny.podbean.com Christopher Pelham currently serves as teaching assistant for the Monday ACIM class and will sometimes lead the group when Ms. Kasaki is away. He is the Director and a co-founder of CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing). He produces arts\/cultural\/educational events at the Center, leads Inner Vision Workouts, and works as a CRS Healer and teacher of A Course in Miracles. In addition to studying ACIM with Yasuko Kasaki since 2003, he studied the Spiritual Psychology of Acting with London-based teacher John Osborne Hughes and Keith Johnstone-based Improvisation with the late Gloria Maddox.

We are a smallish sized group that enjoys playing together once every week or two at the local public golf courses.&nbsp;<span>Please note that this is NOT a singles meetup type of event. It's for people who enjoy playing golf and enjoy it that much more when playing with others.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>My ideal is to have eight people (for two foursomes) for &nbsp;each outing. As things developed last summer, we will likely again end up with a core of 3 to 4 people who show up almost every time. Other players will then vary (which is great; always fun to meet and play with new people ... well, people in the group). People split up (i.e. no cliques). Everyone I've meet so far in the group has been quite friendly and accommodating of others. As space permits, bring along a friend to play if that helps round out getting two full foursomes. &nbsp;... Hopefully this year we can get some competitive games (such as the two foursomes competing for best score with each foursome having a full range of skill levels).<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Although I'm mostly thinking of a group of guys playing golf, I don't want to be exclusionary.

Hey, whatever.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>If you can say \"yes\" to most of these questions then you would be pretty compatible with the group:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. You're a young senior. ... For myself I'm 62. But ages in the group range.<\/p>\n<p>2. You're available during weekdays to play. ... Wanted so we can get cheaper rates. Being retired or semi-retired helps.<\/p>\n<p>3. You're nearby (within 7 or so miles of Cranford). ... This ties in with keeping the group small.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. You play in the area. ... As for me, I normally play at these public courses: Hyatt Hills, Ashbrook, Galloping Hills, and the Summit Muni (a par 3 course). But we've played at some courses farther afield (like the Rutgers golf course) and have had fun with it. Other courses are welcome if you have one you like.<\/p>\n<p>5. You can already play golf. ... You can be somewhat poor, mediocre, or quite good. ... So you know, my handicap is a 26. Yeah, that's on the high side but I'm getting better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. You follow good golf etiquette. ... For example, you keep up your pace of play. Also, you know and follow the rules (but if you need a mulligan please take it).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>7. Good attitude. ... Even if your game is going poorly you enjoy being out and can joke around with others. 'Nuff said?

This group meets, both in New York and electronically, in support of the vast meditative effort that is underway on our planet to let in the light. Our work includes meditations at the time of the new and full moon, a weekly webinar, as well as a spring conference and a seminar in the fall. The full moon meetings include a talk on themes related to the energies coloring the particular constellation under consideration, while the meetings at the new moon consist of group discussion related to the various crises confronting our world as we transition into a new age. Each meeting concludes with a group meditation through which we serve through the contacting, holding and distribution of the contacted energy to all life forms. The moments of the full and new moons each month provide the greatest opportunity for us to pause and align ourselves with the soul and, in turn, with the planetary heart center, the Spiritual Hierarchy. Through such means we cooperate with the Divine Plan or Intention for our world. Today, countless groups, large and small, meet regularly throughout the world at these interlude periods in the cycles of nature. These groups have been meeting for decades, so the work does not start anew each month but rather builds and grows upon a well-established foundation, a living nucleus of spiritual energy from which we take and to which we give. This work demands of us at all times a deepened understanding and an increased ability to penetrate to new levels of consciousness so lifting humanity as a whole. http:\/\/www.lucistrust.org\/en\/service_activities\/start_a_meditation_group\/resource_center","lon":-74.0100021362,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":193144989,"name":"Lucis Trust","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/highres_250178629.jpeg","photo_id":250178629,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/member_250178629.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/6\/e\/5\/thumb_250178629.jpeg"}},"members":51,"name":"New York Meditation as a Way of Life","id":18986696,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Meditation-as-a-Way-of-Life","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1443731112000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"creative","name":"Creativity","id":36229},{"urlkey":"female-entrepreneurs","name":"Female Entrepreneurs","id":41905}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-growing-professionals\/","rating":4.66,"description":"<p>When you no longer feel a true connection with the crowd you grew up with and the co-workers...

It's a Movement born out of a weariness with the status quo that puts HR leaders and doers in a box. WGNinHR is busting us out of those boxes, and breaking all paradigms. It's for those who dare to ask 'what's next?', expecting to be challenged to new levels in HR - or even outside of it...to the C-Suite and perhaps, eventually, to the top seat. After launching as a (virtual) membership organization (<b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgninhr.org\">www.wgninhr.org<\/a><\/b>), WGNinHR is now ready to establish a NY presence.

The fact is, too many HR pros are convinced that they can\u2019t aspire to more \u2013 in their fields, outside their fields, to the C-Suite and even to the CEO seat.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>This Meetup is for you.&nbsp; Whether you\u2019re the aspiring HR pro having just graduated and in your first HR gig, or the more seasoned among us with 20+ years of HR and business experience.&nbsp; This is for you <i>if <\/i>you truly believe that there\u2019s more to your career story.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>NY Trailblazers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The goal is a monthly meetup like no other.&nbsp; Yes, there will be networking which is awesome.

We hope to provide a faster and more personal response than government agencies can or will provide. We need Patriotic Americans in every background; Child care, emergency response, military, medical, self-defense, Law Enforcement, etc. all can help achieve our goal.

No previous knowledge of board games is necessary. We're happy to help newcomers along with how to play, as well as how to plan strategies to win the games. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our event is every Monday &amp; Thursday night at Dave &amp; Buster's in Westbury Long Island from 6:30pm to 10:30pm. &nbsp;You can leave prior to 10:30pm if you want, also please note that Dave &amp; Buster's closes at Midnight for those who want to stay later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Most people arrive at 6:30pm. &nbsp;We use the first 30 minutes to talk, order food\/drinks, and pick out games while we wait for any people that are a little late. &nbsp;Promptly at 7pm we split into groups and play our games that typically take 2 hours to play. &nbsp;So, if you arrive after 7pm there is a good chance that you will not be able to get into a game and can watch us play if you'd like. &nbsp;At the end of the night we play a couple of additional shorter games that you can get into.<\/p>\n<p><span>This group meets in the Large Dining Room at the table directly in front of the wall with 9 Big Screen TV's (We are located 1 room over from the pool tables).<\/span><span>There is no cover charge to enter Dave &amp; Buster's and plenty of parking is available. Also, there is no fee to join this meetup group. All that management at Dave &amp; Buster's asks is that each person purchase $5 off their menu (it can be 1 appetizer, or 1 dessert, or a few sodas, basically whatever you choose). &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Plenty of board games will be present at this event, but feel free to bring some of your favorites. Some of the games that we play are Kingsburg,&nbsp;Stone Age,&nbsp;Lords of Waterdeep,&nbsp;Istanbul, Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Love Letter Batman, Splendor,&nbsp;Pirate's Cove,&nbsp;Five Tribes, Castles of Burgundy,&nbsp;and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of the board games I own on the BGG website:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a

These ideas are meant to be about the issues most important to your heart: <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;Why are you here? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you believe? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;What should you learn? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How do you succeed? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp; What should you being doing to make the world better? <br>&nbsp;\u2022 &nbsp;How can you be happy(ier)?<\/p>\n<p>This is not about doctrine, dogma, or definiteness. This is about dialectics, discourse, and discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Each week a topic or theme will be presented around ideas or thoughts from the realms of science, western philosophy, eastern philosophy, and literature. I draw on the world of many great western minds, including: Thoreau, Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, Sun Tzu, Epictetus, Jung, Aquinas, Fromm, James..\u2026 and as a Sanskrit theorist I draw on many of the ancient Vedic texts, the Mahabharata, The Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Upanishads, The Bengali poets and scholars, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the topics will be about yoga, science, meditation, philosophy, and basically all things that can be used to help us explore how to both think more clearly and at the same time reside happily in the cloud of unknowing.<\/p>\n<p>Each week I will offer a presentation about the topic that is no more than 17 minutes long.&nbsp;We will then have a discussion on the topic, and sharing time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>So, remember to bring something that inspires you to share. It can be a piece of music, a photo, a poem, or even a short anecdote.&nbsp;<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>I will close the session with some brief remarks, and then go to brunch, or, if the weather is nice, on a picnic. I hope you will join me \u263a<\/p>\n<p><b>About your host<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/9\/e\/600_442774206.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>My name is Atma. I speak four languages and can read and write Sanskrit. I am a behavioral scientist with a background in educational psychology. I am spiritual, but not religious. I am agnostic, but not atheistic. I am rational, but not close-minded. I am here to be of service to others. I like art, history, science, music, literature, and things that buzz or blink. I think coming together as a community on Sunday mornings has value, but I\u2019m not into church. I want to grow and learn in the company of my peers, and friends, free from the dictates of dogma and blue hair.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I have created Voki-all-joyo (phonetic for voki al \u011dojo.) This is Esperanto (one of my favorite languages) for Call to Joy. I named it this because I am convinced that our constitutional position as spirits in a human form is to be full of joy. I aIso feel strongly that clear thinking is the best path to real joy. Please note, when I say, \u2018be full of joy\u2019, I do not mean joy in some horribly homogeneous way, like a narcotized, monolithically emotional state. I mean joy, as in a rich state of appreciation and wonder at the mystery and beauty of life. (Like the feeling you get when you find a box of Twinkies in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland.)<\/p>\n<p>So, think of this as a pasta sea of fellow swimmers who are looking for what binds us together without being bound up by the ligaments of human speculation. Since perhaps, it is not so wise to hold dear that which is so dearly held by those who prefer not think for themselves:)<\/p>\n<p>Think clearly and be grateful <br>(Pensi klare kaj esti dankema)<\/p>\n<p><i>Atma<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Our club greeting: <\/b> <br>~ Ne estu schmuckie (Don\u2019t be a schmuck)<\/p>\n<p>~ Vi nek (You either)<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/highres_442780987.jpeg","photo_id":442780987,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/600_442780987.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/1\/b\/thumb_442780987.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13673881,"name":"Atma Degeyndt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/highres_250316380.jpeg","photo_id":250316380,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/member_250316380.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/c\/3\/c\/thumb_250316380.jpeg"}},"members":119,"name":"NYC Philosophy, Science, & Spirituality Meetup","id":19002525,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Philosophy-Science-Spirituality-Meetup","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Clear Thinkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444165393000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"realestateagent","name":"Real Estate Agent","id":2027},{"urlkey":"real-estate-networking","name":"Real Estate Networking","id":15088},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investors","name":"Real Estate Investors","id":16165},{"urlkey":"realtors","name":"Realtors","id":16166},{"urlkey":"real-estate-investing","name":"Real Estate Investing","id":17028},{"urlkey":"real-estate","name":"Real Estate","id":18964},{"urlkey":"real-estate-broker","name":"Real Estate Broker","id":22932},{"urlkey":"accountant","name":"Accountant","id":23654},{"urlkey":"home-loans-mortgages","name":"Home Loans, Mortgages","id":27516},{"urlkey":"mortgage-brokers","name":"Mortgage Brokers","id":32915},{"urlkey":"legal-professionals","name":"Legal Professionals","id":34082},{"urlkey":"attorneys","name":"Attorneys","id":71041},{"urlkey":"hard-money-lenders","name":"Hard Money Lenders","id":171805},{"urlkey":"bankers","name":"Bankers","id":1501312}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Real-Estate-Networking-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"We are a dynamic and well connected networking group bringing together real estate brokers, accountants, bankers, title companies, investors, attorneys, and everyone who is active in the real estate industry in an effort to connect, exchange ideas, and join forces to build their respective businesses, skill-sets, networks, and perspectives.\n\nWhether you are just starting out in real estate and looking to learn, or are working on building long term business relationships and increasing business revenues, this Meetup is for YOU.\nMembership to our group is free.

This comes in many forms, whether it is an individual deciding to turn their car off while waiting to pick up a friend instead of idling or a food service provider choosing to to donate their excess inventory at the end of a day instead of throwing it out; these are only two examples out of hundreds, maybe thousands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have turned many of these actions into programs and campaigns and are always looking for opportunities to grow them or develop new ones. By building a face-to-face community, we hope to engage more of the Stamford community in our work and make our city a leader in food and transportation fuel sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sustainable America is a national non-profit located in Stamford, CT.

Yes, there IS bias here because MWC members are highly capable in the many roles they pursue \u2013 which include: chefs, friends, bankers, teachers, quilters, artists, lawyers, parents, authors, doctors, musicians, agents, philanthropists, spouses, entrepreneurs, professors, caterers, accountants, designers, producers, historians, actresses and grandparents. And probably a few Indian chiefs, too! The MWC \u201cclubhouse\u201d is New York City and its immediate environs because of the infinite variety, diversity and scope New York offers in terms of extraordinary things to see and do.

I've been a resident of the Upper East side for a number of years, and I often find myself traveling out of my own neighborhood to meet up with friends all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice for me to come home after work and go to a happy hour locally or get out of bed on the weekend and not have to spend time commuting to meet friends for brunch downtown or on the west side of town.&nbsp; So I decided to create&nbsp;a group that caters to those of us between the age of 25-45 years of age who would like to get together&nbsp;for Happy Hours and Brunch events throughout the week and on the weekends.<br><br>Happy Hour and Brunch events will be the main types&nbsp;of&nbsp;get togethers&nbsp;we will host initially, but&nbsp;my hope is to expand by sharing events hosted by other UES groups as well.&nbsp; This way you will have one place to find out about&nbsp;events, instead of having to join 50 meetup groups to keep on top of things on the UES.&nbsp; If you are an organizer of another group, please contact me and I would love to place your event on our calendar.&nbsp; My second goal is to set up potlucks, trips to other parts of the city and out of town, cooking classes, and other events to create a greater sense of community.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>As of April 1st 2016,&nbsp;look for all events in our calendar that say \"Living on the Upper East Side - Happy Hour and Brunch(HH+B)\" for get togethers that&nbsp;are hosted by our organizers.&nbsp; Our group events will never be more than 15-20 people, which should allow for diversity&nbsp;in the&nbsp;types of people you will meet but&nbsp;an event wont be&nbsp;too large that you will get lost in the crowd.&nbsp;

(Many of them even include Q&amp;A with stars\/director\/writers. Such screenings will be featured on this site) And I can't be the only one who thought it would be fun to go there with multiple people, getting together after the movie and talk about what we just saw. (And maybe, you might meet someone new...) If that's what you have in mind, this meetup is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see movies possibly with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Steven Spielberg, Bill Murray, George Clooney, Kiera Knightly, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Felicity Jones, etc and ask them questions directly in person afterwards? For all this for free? Or see all these Oscar contender films before everyone else has a chance to see them at all at some gorgeous and cushy private screening rooms (with no worries for bedbugs)? This is a privilege we have as voters (who are truly in this show business and really work there, not as a spectator) and that's the experience we will be able to share once you join this group, ultimately will lead us into our exclusive Oscars Viewing Party.<\/p>\n<p>(I wish I could make the site more visible for non-members so that people can actually see what kind of movies we are offering. Unfortunately, the team of studio attorneys warned us that we are being watched - for understandable reason since we deal with many yet-to-be-released films and Q&amp;A events with high profile celebrities - so I'll have to make it private until you join us once the award season gets underway. Sorry about that.)<\/p>\n<p>Voters are entitled to one guest (note: guests do NOT need to be guild members) so the numbers can grow pretty quickly. However, in terms of joining this group, we need to limit to people in the 20s - 50s who are members of any of the following (required to be able to actually sign up for the screenings for free - Studios do check the membership card so please be honest. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help you): AMPAS, HFPA, BAFTA, SAG-AFTRA, DGA, PGA, WGA and others.

Our events will be a place to reflect, discuss some things with others who share a curious mindset, and walk away with your brain feeling refreshed!&nbsp; Right now most of our events will be in NYC (mostly Manhattan), but in the coming months we will be expanding - to request a speaker or topic, please reach out to Feedback@l2o.com!<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/9\/3\/highres_443021363.jpeg","photo_id":443021363,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/9\/3\/600_443021363.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/9\/3\/thumb_443021363.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194059519,"name":"Girish Bhakoo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/0\/5\/5\/highres_250512373.jpeg","photo_id":250512373,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/0\/5\/5\/member_250512373.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/0\/5\/5\/thumb_250512373.jpeg"}},"members":52,"name":"L2O:  Learn for Life (Conversations)","id":19024300,"state":"NY","urlname":"L2O-Conversations-Shared-Learning-Discovery","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Learners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444759509000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"feminism","name":"Feminism","id":312},{"urlkey":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","id":849},{"urlkey":"humanrights","name":"Human Rights","id":1546},{"urlkey":"movement","name":"Social Movements","id":10460},{"urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion","id":15083},{"urlkey":"womens-rights","name":"Women's Rights","id":15910},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"activism","name":"Activism","id":19197},{"urlkey":"equality","name":"Equality","id":22710},{"urlkey":"social-issues","name":"Social Issues","id":31364},{"urlkey":"feminist","name":"Feminist","id":37271},{"urlkey":"feminist-activism","name":"Feminist Activism","id":65198},{"urlkey":"gender-equality","name":"Gender Equality","id":102002},{"urlkey":"wisconsin-progressives","name":"Progressives","id":528482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Male-Feminist-Initiative\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Our Mission:<\/p>\n<p>1.

Research show's that being a part of a community that shared your goals is integral to achieving them. Personally, I've always participated in team sports or activities like football, wrestling, rugby, and martial arts. What keeps me coming back and engaged is the community and camaraderie inherent in these group activities. Weightlifting is another matter though. I know my way around a gym, but lifting alone is difficult for me. The lack of accountability and engagement usually leads me to modifying routines that shouldn't be modified or abandoning lifting all together and focussing on my group activities (Currently Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). So my goal for this group is to find some more buddies who want to partner with me on lifting. I'm going to be on the program outlined in \"Man 2.0, Engineering the Alpha.\" This group is for guys like me, to find other guys like me, so that we can do this together! While I have a specific program that I want to engage, this group will serve as a hub for other guys in our situation to meet one another, find someone else who wants to engage in a program of your choosing and move onward!","lon":-74.3600006104,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":42906772,"name":"Shane","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/highres_247885566.jpeg","photo_id":247885566,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/member_247885566.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/d\/e\/thumb_247885566.jpeg"}},"members":22,"name":"Personal Revolution Workout Buddies","id":19029933,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Personal-Revolution-Workout-Buddies","category":{"name":"LGBT","id":12,"shortname":"lgbt"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Savages"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1444920289000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"korean","name":"Korean Language","id":862},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"asianpros","name":"Asian Professionals","id":9760},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"business-in-china","name":"Business in China","id":16053},{"urlkey":"asian","name":"Asians","id":20816},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"chinese-culture","name":"Chinese Culture","id":33004},{"urlkey":"learning-chinese","name":"Learning Chinese","id":56708},{"urlkey":"asian-americans","name":"Asian Americans","id":69584},{"urlkey":"asian-singles-30s-40s","name":"Asian Singles 30s 40s","id":96692},{"urlkey":"asian-americans-30s-40s","name":"Asian Americans 30s 40s","id":96694},{"urlkey":"mandarin-chinese","name":"Mandarin Chinese","id":127454},{"urlkey":"movies-and-movie-watching","name":"Movies and Movie Watching","id":280301}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Asian-NYC-Watching-Movies-Weekend-Events\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for Asians or anyone interested in joining movies and cultural events, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. I started this group because I am a big fan of cinema but I hate to go see a movie alone.

I chose personal development!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I have studied this industry for over a decade and was privileged to meet some very rich and wealthy people. Over the years I have only practiced strategies used by the wealthy and it has transformed my life from not being able to afford most things to now-being able to live a life free of financial boundaries. As a result I wanted to share what I've learned from self-improvement and the only way I could do that was to create a new word, \"Selfceed\". Selfceed means to succeed in self, building a sound character that runs on a core philosophy of, you are what you attract by the person you become. &nbsp;The Selfceed Forum is essentially a <b><i>book club forum<\/i><\/b> designed to help members make more money, manage their time and problems better by interacting with like-minded individuals who practice self-improvement. Our only requirement is that when you join us, you come with an open mind and a coachable outlook.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Napoleon Hill invested decades into exploring what millionaires and billionaires<i><b>&nbsp;in America<\/b><\/i> had in common. He discovered that a <b><i>key<\/i><\/b> factor in their practices included \"<i><b>A Mastermind Group<\/b><\/i>\" which involved getting around like-minded individuals brainstorming on how to get ahead and The Selfceed Forum can be your mastermind group! I have invested over a decade into this field and I would like for you all to help evolve this concept to be more mainstream by empowering others who really need a hand up, not a hand out.

From a self-defense aspect it can end an attack suddenly, severely and decisively or dissipate it with the gentleness of a soft breeze. <\/p>\n<p> <br>Aikido's unique approach is to blend with an attack rather than clash with it. The attack is redirected safely away into a throw or pin. Its circular, flowing techniques are effective and can be learned by anyone regardless of size, age or gender. Men, women, children and seniors all find it appealing because Aikido techniques are not based on pitting one's strength against another's. Students learn to defend themselves without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Self esteem, concentration, awareness and focusing power are enhanced. Balance and calmness are therefore maintained in all situations. This state of being is then carried off the mat and into the activity and interactions of daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Aikido Centers was established in 1988 after Sensei O'Connor had been studying and teaching for 12 years.

For example, a technique does not work by itself unless combined with the concepts of balance, power, speed, focus, timing, and attitude. When combining these elements, the outcome or whole is far more effective then what would normally be the sum of the parts. This is the reason techniques, as practiced in the system, are only tools used to understand, accept and retain these ideas. The number of different techniques mastered by an individual does not increase his level of competence in this system. Techniques are only practiced moves until combined with the proper fighting concepts. The ultimate goal of the martial arts is to make your mental, physical and technical skills work as one. The goal of Latosa Escrima is to do this while producing a quality Escrimador who can think creatively and react responsively rather than giving people information overload. Escrima was the original name used under the flag of the Philippine Martial Arts Society. The name changed to Combat Escrima as the system was influenced by the concept of using power and combat reality. Combat Escrima relied on a single goal; winning. This goal proved to be a very valuable asset. The intimidation factor of the name \"Combat Escrima\" was something the students felt they had to defend. However, just the goal of winning actually proved limiting in the progression of the system and future instructors. PMAS produced excellent fighters and world champions but failed to produce very many well-rounded instructors. PMAS had the box recipe for producing competent fighters but failed to isolate the individual ingredients that make up the end product. Latosa spent his time developing training methods used to understand the reasoning behind the techniques and isolating the concepts of Escrima. Wing Tzun is self defense in it's most consequent form Wing Tzun is the smartest self-defense system ever thought of by humankind, because Wing Tzun is not based upon physical strength or acrobatic ability and therefore allows a physically weaker person to defend him\/herself. Wing Tzun teaches you to use the force of the opponent and turn it against him. Wing Tzun self defense movements derive from tactile reflexes that are mechanical and directly determined by the attack of the opponent. In this way WT is not susceptible to optical manipulations meant to mislead the fighter. Wing Tzun can be learned fairly quickly and built upon. Wing Tzun meets the demands of \"appropriate force\" and therefore lends itself for use by law enforcement.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":192115611,"name":"Rawb Prime","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/highres_249326551.jpeg","photo_id":249326551,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/member_249326551.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/7\/b\/7\/thumb_249326551.jpeg"}},"members":11,"name":"Latosa Escrima and Wing Tsun Meetup","id":19036470,"state":"NY","urlname":"Latosa-Escrima-and-Wing-Tsun-Meetup","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Escrimadors and Technicians"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445132274000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sake","name":"Sake","id":9744},{"urlkey":"language","name":"Language & Culture","id":10454},{"urlkey":"japanese-language","name":"Japanese Language","id":25544},{"urlkey":"japanese-food","name":"Japanese Food","id":25545},{"urlkey":"japanese-culture","name":"Japanese Culture","id":30366},{"urlkey":"culture-exchange","name":"Culture Exchange","id":67622},{"urlkey":"sake-tasting","name":"Sake Tasting","id":72368},{"urlkey":"sake-pairing","name":"Sake Pairing","id":136330},{"urlkey":"japanese-sake","name":"Japanese sake","id":242661},{"urlkey":"japanese-food-and-culture","name":"Japanese food and Culture","id":344101},{"urlkey":"japanese-food-culture","name":"Japanese food culture","id":1215142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/sakeplus-ny\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>To drink up with sake lovers from all over the world!<\/p>\n<p>We select only delicious sake for a season, and we invite sake professionals like Touji (sake brewers), Kikizake-shi (sake sommelier).<\/p>\n<p>Let's enjoy cheers!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/highres_443142114.jpeg","photo_id":443142114,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/600_443142114.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/8\/2\/thumb_443142114.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182462174,"name":"Yuki Ono","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/highres_250630117.jpeg","photo_id":250630117,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/member_250630117.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/7\/8\/5\/thumb_250630117.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"[SAKE+] Sake Samurai in NY!","id":19036932,"state":"NY","urlname":"sakeplus-ny","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sake Samurai"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445133911000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"interracial-dating","name":"Interracial Dating","id":25504},{"urlkey":"dating-relationship-advice","name":"Dating & Relationship Advice","id":70113},{"urlkey":"dating-advice","name":"Dating Advice","id":97613},{"urlkey":"internet-dating","name":"Internet Dating","id":113418},{"urlkey":"dating-advice-for-women","name":"Dating Advice For Women","id":145615},{"urlkey":"meeting-and-attracting-men","name":"Meeting and Attracting Men","id":1504314}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rules-Dating-Advice-For-Women-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is the first Meetup group that encourages &amp; supports The Rules.

Participants will learn how to develop their musicianship more quickly by utilizing modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam groups since 2010. &nbsp;The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the ABB. &nbsp;These sessions are a lot of fun. &nbsp;Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the ABB with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.&nbsp; Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.&nbsp; Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.&nbsp; Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. &nbsp;Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.&nbsp; Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN: <\/p>\n<p>The music of The Allman Brothers Band is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. &nbsp;However, learning the music of the ABB can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is how I can help you learn. &nbsp;This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the ABB played it. &nbsp;The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.&nbsp; I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.&nbsp; The charts are clear about song form,&nbsp;intros, &nbsp;chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.&nbsp; Both Duane Allman and Dicky Betts' parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In most cases, Berry Oakley's bass lines have been transcribed. &nbsp;The ABB shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose. <\/p>\n<p>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN: <\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord&nbsp;progressions and song&nbsp;forms; the actual chord voicings;&nbsp;specific chord progressions used during the improv sections; slide guitar techniques; pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;&nbsp;chord\/scale combinations; use of chromaticism; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation to improvise.&nbsp; There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.&nbsp; People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation. <\/p>\n<p>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. &nbsp;In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on many songs including: &nbsp; Staesboro Blues, Trouble No More, Don't Keep me Wonderin', Done Somebody Wrong, One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Dreams, Blue Sky, Hot 'Lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Little Martha, Midnight Rider, Mountain Jam, Stormy Monday, Whipping Post, You Don't Love Me and others.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE COORDINATOR:<\/p>\n<p>I am a professional musician with over 40 years experience. I began playing the guitar at four years old and performing professionally at 15. &nbsp;I've performed all over the world at countless venues and festivals. &nbsp;Additionally, I teach privately and at a variety of music schools. &nbsp;As a performer and recording artist I play many styles of music including rock, blues, jazz and folk.<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/highres_443233561.jpeg","photo_id":443233561,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/600_443233561.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/4\/f\/9\/thumb_443233561.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13972016,"name":"Luke Johnson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/highres_12000209.jpeg","photo_id":12000209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/member_12000209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/1\/thumb_12000209.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"New York City Allman Brothers Band Song and Jam","id":19041096,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-City-Allman-Brothers-Band-Song-and-Jam","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.75,"who":"ABB Jammers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445269204000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"programming-languages","name":"Programming Languages","id":17628},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hoboken-Pluralsight-Study-group\/","rating":0,"description":"The Hoboken Pluralsight Study Group was started because we love the idea of the NYC Pluralsight Study Group, but we wanted something a bit easier to attend.

In this lively, interactive workshop, Robert Vetter deconstructs processes of spiritual healing found in cultures found all over the world, and shares a formula for healing that can be adapted to almost any energetic or spiritual healing discipline. By looking at the methods of other cultures, you will understand on a deeper level what healing is, how it works, and the ways that various healers master a universal code that underlies the healing process.\n\nWorkshop topics include:\n\n\u2022 Understanding your calling as a healer\n\u2022 Developing a healing presence\n\u2022 Respectfully borrowing healing practices from other cultures\n\u2022 Constructing altars to invoke the power of symbols in healing\n\u2022 Engaging all 5 senses in healing\n\u2022 Grasping a deeper meaning that underlies the wounded healer archetype\n\u2022 Methods of self-protection that you can implement in your practice\n\u2022 The power of narrative medicine: using words to heal\n\u2022 Acquiring healing energy\n\u2022 Soul retrieval and re-integration\n\nDuring this workshop, you will develop your own unique healing protocol that is a reflection of who you are on your individual journey. In learning to heal using this method, you will also uncover how healing is a spiritual path that directs us through the entire cycle of human life, imbuing it with meaning and purpose.\n\nRobert Vetter, M.A. is a cultural anthropologist, who began his studies of cross cultural healing practices at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980\u2019s. He has apprenticed and learned from a variety of teachers in modalities that include traditional Mesoamerican medicine (Curanderismo), Native North American medicine, and Medical or Healing Qigong among others. He maintains a healing practice in what he calls Ethno-Energetic Healing. He is the co-author (along with his adopted uncle, Kiowa medicine man, Richard Tartsah) of the book Big Bow: The Spiritual Life and Teachings of a Kiowa Family. He is vice president of Joshua\u2019s Place Center for Healing in Southampton, NY. He has taught at the New York Open Center, Wainwright House, Mount Madonna Center in the San Francisco Bay area, The Sanctuary at Mount Shasta, and many other venues.\n\nExchange: $65","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":72465082,"name":"Awakening NY","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/highres_246562844.jpeg","photo_id":246562844,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/member_246562844.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/9\/3\/c\/thumb_246562844.jpeg"}},"members":21,"name":"Healing Spirituality As A Life Journey","id":19041709,"state":"NY","urlname":"Healing-Spirituality-As-A-Life-Journey","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Healers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445273477000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"womens-health","name":"Women's Health","id":16973},{"urlkey":"natural-health","name":"Natural Health","id":17124},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"womens-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Health and Wellness","id":46865},{"urlkey":"womens-support-group-health-and-wellness","name":"Women's Support Group Health and Wellness","id":94489},{"urlkey":"womens-support","name":"Women's Support","id":144477},{"urlkey":"womens-sexual-health","name":"Women's Sexual Health","id":222511},{"urlkey":"women-health","name":"Women health","id":1407762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Premenstrual-Dysphoric-Disorder-PMDD-Support\/","rating":0,"description":"PMDD is more than a little bloating and cramping before a period. It is a mood disorder that accompanies the other premenstrual symptoms. The PMDD gets more severe as the period draws near, escalating the sufferer to a state of very high tension, anxiety and aggression. It enhances other coexisting mood disorders to complicate any treatment for several days during the month. PMDD is thought to be a brain chemistry malfunction that is triggered by ovulation. Symptoms usually begin after ovulation and last into the first days of the period. This cycle repeats itself every month. PMDD is tied to the hormonal changes triggered by ovulation, so it does not occur without this part of the menstrual cycle. The condition affects up to 8 percent of women. The condition involves much more than a bad time during a period. It is cyclical, occurring at the same point in the menstrual cycle each month. The symptoms of PMDD are severe and usually life altering. Doctors require sufferers to have at least five of the following symptoms to support a diagnosis: Depression of hopeless feelings Feelings of anxiousness, tension or edge Irritability that increases as period nears Oversleeping or insomnia Lack of interest in favorite things No motivation Loss of energy Difficulty focusing and concentrating Loss of control feelings, feeling overwhelmed Severe physical manifestation of PMS symptoms like tender breasts, cramping, bloating, muscle pain and weight gain Suicidal thoughts Source: http:\/\/www.psychguides.com\/guides\/living-with-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\/ Message from Organizer: Last year I learned that I have PMDD. The only thing I found that truly helps the mental aspect of PMDD is joining online forums where other women discuss their experiences with PMDD, thus learning that I am not alone. I am making this group so members can meet and give support to other PMDD suffers. I'm calling the members \"Lunar Girls\" because of how we're affected by our cycle, much like the moon. I thought about calling us werewolves but that seemed a bit extreme.

Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter. The Song Club is led by the founder of the Collective -Peter Bliss. The Collective Song Club\u201d will begin on October 14th and follow every other Wednesday evening (skipping the night before Thanksgiving). It will take place at Planet Studio NYC (www.planetstudionyc.com) 244 West 54th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue in Suite 800B on the 8th floor. It will begin at 5:30PM so those heading home from work can stop in without it getting too late. Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. You can\u2019t even really be late! Leave when you like! There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you! There are no requirements other than to become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee until the end of 2015 is only $35. This membership entitles you to participate in all the Collective workshops as well as perform a song (or have your song performed) in our quarterly Member Benefit Showcases held at the Bitter End. It's easy to become a member - go to www.newyorksongwriterscollective.com and look for \"Sign Up\/Sign In\" in he top right corner of the webpage! The CSC is an experiment that will hopefully find a place and grow with the necessary changes and additions as it is established. Could it happen every week save for special days and holidays? Could special guests from the industry drop in that would be announced shortly before a session on the Collective website? We shall see! Join us for our first session on October 14th and let\u2019s see what happens! Peter Bliss \/ Profile: Peter Bliss songs have been recorded by artists like Barbra Streisand, NYSNC, Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Southside Johnny, and many more. Peter\u2019s journey began as an artist\/songwriter releasing his United Artists debut LP in his early twenties. He continued writing and producing for artists, television and film.

They do not have friends in the neighborhood, and want to \"fit in\" so badly but don't! Parents, I say ENOUGH, it's got to start with us! Please if you are as frustrated as I am, lets get together, and HELP! Lets help and brainstorm and make this happen! I personally, have a 32 yr old high functioning daughter at home, who is lucky enough to have a 34 yr. old sister who loves and adores her. But as we all know 'its not enough\"! These young people need friends, they need their peers! They need movie dates, bowling dates, parties to attend, or just taking turn hang out at each others house. Parents, as you have already found out the first step to help will always be family. I am looking for dedicated mothers, fathers, sisters , brothers or whoever that family member might consist of. If your plain tired and sad of seeing your grown young adult home alone on the entire weekend with no plans , no friends, or sitting in their room watching a funny movie alone then reach out and lets move forward together. It just begins with one or two of us to start a network of friends for are kids, then before you know it, they are no longer alone!<\/p>","lon":-73.8799972534,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":41685752,"name":"Kristy Lynn Staniszewski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/highres_241621249.jpeg","photo_id":241621249,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/member_241621249.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/thumb_241621249.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"Socializing For High Functioning Young Adults in Westchester","id":19048902,"state":"NY","urlname":"Socializing-For-High-Functioning-Young-Adults","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.9399986267,"who":"True Friends"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445457886000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"businessintell","name":"Business Intelligence","id":10538},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"qlikview","name":"Qlikview","id":60832},{"urlkey":"business-analytics","name":"Business Analytics","id":98842},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"business-intelligence-tools-and-technology","name":"Business Intelligence Tools and Technology","id":148287},{"urlkey":"tableau","name":"Tableau","id":168154},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"tableau-software","name":"Tableau Software","id":1433052},{"urlkey":"qlik-sense","name":"Qlik Sense","id":1505900}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Qlikview-Networking-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for anyone utilizing QlikView or&nbsp;Tableau&nbsp;on the BI Platform.

But when we get older, and need assistance with daily living activities, are we going to want to place the responsibility for our care on the shoulders of our loved ones? It's not just hands-on care: 8 percent of baby boomers, 13 percent of Generation X and 19 percent of millennials are financially supporting a parent, to the tune of $12,000 a year, according to a survey of 1,000 adults released this summer from TD Ameritrade. Of those, 31 percent said they are also caregivers for that parent. From 2012 to 2050, the Census Bureau projects, the size of the U.S. population age 65 and older will nearly double. The ranks of the so-called \"old old,\" those 85-plus, will more than triple over that period. Among adults age 51 to 54, 82.8 percent are currently \"at risk\" of needing to provide care for a parent or in-law due to health concerns, according to a 2014 report from The Urban Institute. Yet paid care is out of reach for many. Please come down on November 17th to the New York Life building in Lake Success, NY and attend a free educational workshop on long term care and the many options that are available for us to avoid creating any future hardships for our family members Feel free to contact me for any further information 516-359-8696 Anyone interested in learning about long term care is welcome to join.

overlooking Central Park! This is a one-time event to raise money for a school in Jacmel, Haiti.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2010, I traveled to Haiti as a volunteer to help with recovery efforts after the country was rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I stayed in Jacmel, teaching remedial French classes and working on construction projects. My first week there, I took a basic Haitian Creole lesson, taught by a young man named Fanel Leme. He was a great teacher, and we became friends over the course of my time there. He would hang out with the volunteers outside of class and take us around the city, exposing us to life in Jacmel we would have otherwise missed. He was a great friend and ambassador to Haitian culture.<\/p>\n<p>Now Fanel is pursuing his passion for education, starting a daycare in his hometown, Eagle Kindergarten. In a place&nbsp;where a lot of children are left roaming the streets while their parents eke out a living, his school&nbsp;is an invaluable service to the community. Everything Fanel has accomplished so far is a testament to how resourceful he is: he's built a classroom, and provided uniforms and supplies, all from his own pockets and donations.&nbsp;He&nbsp;recently reached out to me and asked if I would be able to help him build a kitchen for the kids. Sadly, most of them don't get packed lunches&nbsp;from their parents\/caregivers before they're sent off to school. Having meals at school would be a huge leap for their education and overall health. <\/p>\n<p>The goal of this dinner is to raise the funds necessary to finish the construction of Eagle Kindergarten\u2019s kitchen. The cost per guest is will be minimum donation of $40. As I said at the top, there\u2019s going to be delicious food, bottomless drinks, and music, all in a spacious apartment with a large terrace overlooking Central Park \u2013 perfect ingredients for a great time, especially when it\u2019s for a good cause!<\/p>\n<p>Here are some links to the gofundme page I started for Eagle Kindergarten, and Fanel's facebook page for the school:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj\">https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/6v4yz5bj<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/882495101842616\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/88249510184...<\/a> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, you can take care of the donation when you arrive for the dinner on Saturday, or you can get it out of the way now and I'll take note of which guests have already donated prior to the event.<\/span> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/highres_444080256.jpeg","photo_id":444080256,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/600_444080256.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/f\/2\/0\/thumb_444080256.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":194679069,"name":"David Mazzucchi","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/highres_250877642.jpeg","photo_id":250877642,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/member_250877642.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/e\/a\/thumb_250877642.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Fundraising dinner for Haitian school","id":19063602,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Haiti-Meetup","category":{"name":"community\/environment","id":4,"shortname":"community-environment"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Fundraisers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jersey City","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445890957000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"accounting","name":"Accounting","id":378},{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"creative-freelancers","name":"Creative Freelancers","id":25505},{"urlkey":"small-business-accounting","name":"Small Business Accounting","id":27267}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jersey-City-Tax-Accounting-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group will aid small business owners, self-employed individuals and those looking to venture out onto their own in learning fundamental Finance, Accounting and Tax concepts with the aid of skilled designated professionals.

Aren\u2019t you an extension of the higher power you believe in, a piece of what has made up this entire universe? As that, shouldn\u2019t you be able to mold your own universe, your own life, into whatever you choose? With as little struggle and as much fun as you would if you were placing an order and selecting what you wanted from a catalog?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yes you are, and yes you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The truth is <\/b>that the voice within you, the one that\u2019s always known and the one that\u2019s always guiding you - perhaps even to these words right now - is right. The road to whatever transformation you are in search of is an ACCELERATED one- or it can be given the right mentor and the right tools. From my heart to yours, I invite you to experience first-hand how accelerated the transformation that\u2019s been calling you can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>I decided to start this group<\/b> because as a master coach and successful entrepreneur, I notice so many people (including myself at one point in time) in what I call the \u201chamster wheel\u201d of never achieving their goals, where it seems to them that they never will or worse that their experience of getting there is such a struggle that they rob themselves from the joy of the process. It hurts me to see this as so many people's experience, just as much as it hurt me to experience it once myself... and it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The purpose of this meet up is <\/b>for you to discover and uncover what within you is truly holding you back and be given the tools on how to transform that in the most accelerated way. I'll be sharing a way for you to literally shift your existing reality to the one you desire - immediately. I'm sure you\u2019ve heard that many times before, but the difference this time is that I\u2019m not \"just saying this to you\"\u2026 I\u2019m <b>claiming<\/b> this <b>for you <\/b>and inviting you to claim this for yourself<b>.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What gives me the right<\/b> to claim that? Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve DONE with my own life and now it's what I so deeply want for yours. Earlier this year, it was my own voice within that guided me to receiving these tools from my mentor which ended up being THE biggest quantum shift of my life - I tell you, as I\u2019m writing this my heart is beating so fast with the truth that I do not even recognize myself! It is from this place that a fire within me exists to personally guide you to through your own experience of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The very tools that I was given to use for my own accelerated evolution are the very tools that you are being offered right now. I invite you to come find out what those are! Talk is cheap and your personal experience of what I\u2019m sharing with you is stronger than any of my words. Once you get to know me, you\u2019ll learn that I\u2019m not about the fluff, but rather the real \u201chow to\u2019s\u201d to arrive at the transformation you\u2019re looking for... and it's my greatest fulfillment to provide that for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Therefore, these meet-ups are FREE<\/b>\u2026 you have nothing to lose and more than you could ever imagine to gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><b>So, are you ready?

So when you only have 30 seconds to make an impact, you need to be sure of both what to say and how to say it. The \u201celevator pitch\u201d can feel outdated, phony, and utterly cringe-inducing . . . but it doesn't have to be. A well crafted elevator pitch can bring out your inner rock star, give people a sense of what you're about (beyond what you \"do\" -and begin genuine connections. New York-based voice and speech coaches Casey Erin Clark and Julie Fogh of Vital Voice Training will give you the principles to construct and refine a compelling elevator pitch AND show you how to deliver it in a way that truly lands and connects with your audience. Workshop participants will be able to get on your feet, practice, and start to make some connections with other professionals. Post packet PDF included.

Meanwhile, the most transformative energy of all is hiding in plain sight. It's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable. It's called Inner Energy. And everyone already has it \u2014 including you. Become balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. If you're having trouble juggling the challenges in your life, Sahaja Yoga Meditation can help you manage stress, master your emotions and find solutions to your problems.

Within each of us are layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your own way. And our experts are always available to help. Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of Sahaja Yoga Meditation every day may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy (called kundalini in the yogic tradition) and light the path to lifelong transformation. Sahaja is more than a temporary solution or quick relief; it's a journey to complete fulfillment. All classes are free. Everyone is welcome. Bring a friend, bring your kids \u2014 we welcome all ages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.<\/p>\n<p>For more, visit <a>www.sahajameditation.com.<\/a> Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a not-for-profit offering free spiritual meditation guidance in more than 100 countries worldwide.<\/p>","lon":-74.0999984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/highres_447004195.jpeg","photo_id":447004195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/600_447004195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/0\/6\/3\/thumb_447004195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":195226449,"name":"Mark Taylor","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/highres_251193515.jpeg","photo_id":251193515,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/member_251193515.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/2\/e\/b\/thumb_251193515.jpeg"}},"members":77,"name":"East Rutherford Sahaja Yoga Meditation","id":19098841,"state":"NJ","urlname":"East-Rutherford-Sahaja-Yoga-Meditation","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Meditators"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bronx","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1446904199000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"python","name":"Python","id":1064},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"gaming","name":"Gaming","id":18071},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"seo-search-engine-optimization","name":"SEO (Search Engine Optimization)","id":23199},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Tech-Factory-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Inspired by the role technology plays in daily life, we organize devs, designers, artists, and any interested in pushing the envelope from the grassroots by meetings, office hours, events, and workshops.

Let's carpool from the Westchester\/Rockland\/Lower Fairfield area for a casual day trip to Windham or Hunter. Let's leave at 9am and get a half-day ticket. Or ski a full day and still leave at 8am! Both ski areas are just over 2 hrs from the Westchester area and provide enough variety on the slope or off the slopes. No need to rush home after a day of skiing.......let's listen to some music in the lodge and relax before heading out. The goal of this group is to have meetups at local Westchester bars so we can meet other ski buddies and arrange carpools so we can all ski together. And also to have a drink or 2! If you're into hanging out at the lodge, thats cool too....no need to be a skier.

This encompasses scrabble play with clocks, challenges and no looking in the dictionary before you play a word. I have enough equipment for four players or two games. The idea of this meetup is an alternative from playing scrabble online. When people play online there is no supervision so you don't know if the game is legitimate or not. The rules: 25:00 in a standard scrabble game for each opponent. If you go over your clock a minute you are penalized ten points even if it is one second.

I started this group to help women entrepreneurs be supported by one another, to connect, learn, grow and be in a community that builds confidence to help you step into your power and claim your self-worth so that you can do the work that you love and be of service to others AND be able to financially support yourself and your lifestyle of choice without sacrificing your own wellbeing in the process. Whether you are a long time business owner or just starting out, working for yourself, can be a very lonely and sometimes a little scary. We don't always know all the right things to do and we are often afraid, ashamed or too stubborn to ask for help. By nature, we are passionate, giving, independent and creative. A community of like-minded women going for it in their lives and businesses is a force to be reckoned with. When we take out the competitive mindset and instead trust that there is success for each of us, that rising tide lifts all ships.
