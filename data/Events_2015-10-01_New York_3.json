At Columbia University and elsewhere, researchers are mining massive data sets to investigate the origins of our universe, the effects of climate change on our oceans and the structure of promising nanoscale materials. With support of the Moore and Sloan foundations, this work is part of a broader effort to bring the latest machine learning and statistical techniques to traditional scientific analysis. Researchers from Columbia, NYU, the University of Missouri and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies will discuss how data science is enabling discovery in their fields.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/datascience.columbia.edu\/interface-workshop-2015\"> [CLICK HERE FOR FULL AGENDA]<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0David W.

on The As Yet Unnamed Campaign of Increasingly Poor Decisions...<\/p> <p>Our new characters live up to the campaign title and almost immediately get arrested.\u00a0 Sloven, a drow on a mission to discover how much of other people's stuff can fit in his pockets, had the misfortune of being caught cheating at dice in the presence of Bruce, a troll in the Watch's employ.\u00a0 He learned just how long the long arm of the law was when it bashed him in the head.\u00a0 Twice.<\/p> <p>Jerkenit, a Tiefling carny cleric with a wicked streak, got in hot water when his buxom bimbo sidekick Netalia was caught cutting purses by the Watch's newest members, the rest of the party.\u00a0 A few well placed spells and Netalia was in custody, and Jerkenit was being brought in for questioning.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, the Dragonborn Karn, a sorcerer fresh off the boat from distant Prataro across the sea, comes seeking the aid of the Amtaris Mage's Guild for help in recovering his kingdom's crown jewels.\u00a0 Unable to secure an immediate audience with any of the mages, he was directed towards temporary employment in the Watch while he waited for an answer.<\/p> <p>At the Watch House, Sloven and Jerkenit were shanghaied into becoming entertainers for the Saj Estate's grand party, with Netalia and Sloven's truly impressive knife collection held as collateral towards their good behavior.\u00a0 With the Saj Estate down two guards due to death by explosion, Karn showed up just in time to join the Watch and be attached to this merry band of lunatics.<\/p> <p>At the Saj Estate, the brothers Aurora were approached by Count Stoe, a wealthy man who had heard of their work for Major Brightblade the previous evening.\u00a0 He's got a son, Sebathian, in the slums that he wants quietly brought back into the fold, and after some tense negotiations, the brothers agreed to kidnapping\/rescuing the boy.\u00a0 At the end of their shift, they rounded up the posse and headed to the Banshee's Moan tavern in the slums.<\/p> <p>On the way, the group was approached by the Aurora brother's devout, if misguided, convert Tim who asked them to take his son Tim Jr on an adventure to \"do some good.\"\u00a0 Despite a great deal of hesitation, the boy's earnestness won them over and they agreed to take him along for the time being.<\/p> <p>At the Banshee's Moan, our upstanding members of the Watch sent their criminal compatriots into the tavern to blend in and do some recon.\u00a0 After several hours of talking with customers, threatening the owner, and a truly impressive (if ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to catfish a barmaid, Sloven and Jerkenit escaped the bar right before the clientele were about to murder them.\u00a0 They had discovered, however, that Sebathian was hanging out with a redheaded barmaid named Lyra until they both disappeared several days ago and the blonde barmaid working that night, Alessa, may know where Lyra went.<\/p> <p>In an impressively poor decision, the party decided the best way to get Alessa to talk to them was to jump the pretty young girl after her shift and corner her in a dark alley.\u00a0 Their plan was short lived however, when Alessa exited with several other members of the staff.\u00a0 The party approached the barmaid and her friends in a tense attempt to parlay, but she clammed up at the sight of Watch badges.<\/p> <p><br\/>Jerkenit, fed up with getting nowhere, threatened to kill the girl if she didn't tell them where Lyra was.\u00a0 And that's when weapons got drawn.<\/p> <p>Will the party fair better against the Banshee's Moan kitchen staff than they did against a flock of murderbirds?\u00a0 Will they find Lyra and Sebathian?\u00a0 Can they continue to uphold the Watch's oath to not kill anybody?\u00a0 Will they manage to make even poorer decisions?<\/p> <p><br\/>We find out this week, as we start in media res with a back alley brawl.<\/p> <p>(And in other news, Duurg spent his time using his City Watch badge to beat up and arrest people, some of whom may have actually deserve it.)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Edison-Dungeons-Dragons-Meetup\/events\/225082081\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":14400000,"name":"The As Yet Unnamed Campaign of Increasingly Poor

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the B or C local to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p>+++<\/p> <p>OTHER SEASONS...<\/p> <p>WINTER (Nov - Feb)<\/p> <p>During the colder months we generally play two times a week depending on weather. Our main location is Riverside Park with Morningside as a backup.<\/p> <p>There are two days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>- Sundays at 1pm, Riverside Park (108th and West End - Big Soccer Field)<br\/>*Tuesdays\/Thursdays at 6pm games don't last long due to decreasing sunlight.<\/p> <p>FALL (Sep - Oct)<\/p> <p>There are four days that we play:<\/p> <p>- Saturdays at 10am, Morningside Park (110th and Manhattan Ave)<br\/>- Sundays at 4pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Tuesdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<br\/>- Thursdays at 5:30pm, Riverside Park (103rd and West End)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Read instructions in 'Details' - Look for the flying disc...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224801148\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Tuesday\/Thursday Ultimate!","id":"xhrzflytmbnb","time":1441922400000,"updated":1441935628000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10024","country":"us","city":"NYC","address_1":"West 79th St & Hudson River","name":"Boat Basin Cafe","lon":-73.974187,"id":1359588,"state":"NY","lat":40.785946,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.62302994728,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440985550000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's catch the end of happy hour at the Boat Basin cafe on W79th Street.

This growth, in part, has been fueled by the\u00a0needs\u00a0of\u00a0a large number\u00a0of\u00a0people in the world who are learning and\u00a0using a second or foreign language. For example, it is estimated that\u00a0there are currently over one billion people who are non-native\u00a0speakers\u00a0of\u00a0English. These numbers drive the demand for accurate tools\u00a0that can help learners to write and speak proficiently in another\u00a0language. Such demand also makes this an exciting time for those in\u00a0the NLP community who are developing automated methods for\u00a0grammatical\u00a0error\u00a0correction\u00a0(GEC).<\/p> <p>While there\u00a0have been many exciting developments in GEC over the last few years,\u00a0there is still considerable room for improvement as state-of-the-art\u00a0performance in detecting and correcting several important\u00a0error\u00a0types\u00a0is still inadequate for many real world applications.\u00a0 In this\u00a0talk, I\u00a0will provide an overview\u00a0of\u00a0the field\u00a0of\u00a0automated\u00a0grammatical\u00a0error\u00a0correction, including its history, leading methodologies and its\u00a0particular set\u00a0of\u00a0challenges.\u00a0 Although applications\u00a0of\u00a0GEC are often\u00a0geared toward the classroom, its methods are more generally applicable\u00a0to a wide variety\u00a0of\u00a0NLP problems, especially where systems must\u00a0contend with noisy data, such as MT evaluation and\u00a0correction,\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0microblogs and other user-generated content, and\u00a0disfluency detection in speech.<\/p> <p>If time permits, we'll play with a simple grammatical error codebase (using Python and the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning toolkit) to predict the correct preposition in an English sentence.<\/p> <p><b>Speaker bio<\/b>:<\/p> <p>Joel Tetreault is a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs in New\u00a0York City.\u00a0 His research focus is Natural Language Processing with\u00a0specific interests in anaphora, dialogue and discourse processing,\u00a0machine learning, and applying these techniques to the analysis\u00a0of\u00a0English language learning and automated essay scoring.\u00a0 Previously he\u00a0was Principal Manager\u00a0of\u00a0the Core Natural Language group at Nuance\u00a0Communications, Inc. where he worked on the research and development\u00a0of\u00a0NLP tools and components for the next generation\u00a0of\u00a0intelligent\u00a0dialogue systems.\u00a0 Prior to Nuance, he worked at Educational Testing\u00a0Service for six years as a Managing Senior Research Scientist where he\u00a0researched automated methods for detecting\u00a0grammatical\u00a0errors by\u00a0non-native speakers, plagiarism detection, and content scoring. \u00a0Tetreault received his B.A. in Computer Science from Harvard\u00a0University\u00a0and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0Rochester.\u00a0 He was also a postdoctoral research\u00a0scientist at the\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0Pittsburgh's Learning Research and\u00a0Development Center, where he worked on developing spoken\u00a0dialogue tutoring systems.\u00a0 In addition he has co-organized the\u00a0Building Educational Application workshop series for 8 years, the\u00a0CoNLL 2013 Shared Task on\u00a0Grammatical\u00a0Error\u00a0Correction, and is\u00a0currently NAACL Treasurer.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science\/events\/224521077\/","yes_rsvp_count":96,"name":"NLP for Automated Grammatical Error Correction","id":"224521077","time":1441924200000,"updated":1441971819000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1412737323000,"name":"NYC Women in Machine Learning & Data Science","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":17475872,"urlname":"NYC-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"126 W 25th St #1","name":"The Tailory ","lon":-73.993149,"id":24040946,"state":"NY","lat":40.74448,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.416472911835,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440104348000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/4\/2\/e\/600_395630222.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join Eventsy in kicking off the start of New York Fashion Week with The Tailory NYC!<\/p> <p>The best way to start Fashion Week is with style!

The Metamorphic Technique is gentle touch which acts as a catalyst to the transformational power of your own Life Force. There is no need to discuss issues or problems. Anyone can learn MT and use it in their life. After sessions people often make quantum leaps in their lives. Sometimes this shows up as a physical healing, moving out of old life circumstances, improving relationships, finding a new partner, profound healing of whole families and much more ( go to the Blogs page to read about these amazing shifts)<\/p> <p>This technique was developed in England in the 1970\u2019s by a Reflexologist who noticed that when he lightly stroked the spinal reflex points on the foot, it corresponded to our time in the womb where we set up the cellular blueprint for our life. These cells anchor the patterns which shape and challenge us during our lifetime. By lightly stroking these points it acts as a catalyst, allowing you to grow yourself and transform any stuck places, in a way that will always be right for you. Metamorphic Technique is easy to learn and wonderful to receive. The workshop is an empowering teaching full of aha moments. MT is a catalyst for deep and lasting transformation from within. It has been used with couples struggling to conceive, during pregnancy, throughout life and even when loved ones are dying. Through this practice we say Yes to Life and Yes to letting Life grow us from within. The Free Talk: Thursday September 10th, 7pm-8.30pm<\/p> <p>Join me to find out if the Metamorphic Technique can support you in your evolution. We will cover:<br\/>-how to access our transformational nature by not getting in our own way<br\/>-how to transform our life<br\/>-the theory behind this unit approach<br\/>-amazing stories of serious health issues resolved , families healed, infertility reversed, stuck-ness and blocks removed<br\/>-why simple touch like this acts as a catalyst allowing you to transform yourself<br\/>-why our time in the womb sets up the blueprint for our life<br\/>-about the awakening of the heart and the shift on the planet<br\/>-why Metamorphic Technique is the perfect practice for challenging times and difficult situations<br\/>-why MT is the perfect approach when you have tried everything else<br\/>-about Dominique\u2019s own powerful quantum leap after discovering MT<\/p> <p><b>Dominique Mallee Meerof<\/b>f is one of the world\u2019s leading Metamorphic Technique teachers.

When she arrived in America, in 1939, to star in a remake of her 1936 Swedish film <i>Intermezzo<\/i>, the producer David O. Selznick recognized in the 24-year-old a new freshness and accessibility\u2014a radical break with the artificially elaborate notions of \u201cglamor\u201d that had been synonymous with female stars in Hollywood since the late silent era. In films like <i>Casablanca<\/i> (1942), <i>Gaslight<\/i> (1944) and <i>Notorious<\/i> (1946), Bergman seemed to speak directly to her public, cutting through melodramatic conventions.<\/p> <p>Bergman\u2019s search for authenticity eventually led to Italy, where she made five features with the pioneering Neorealist director Roberto Rossellini, a body of work now recognized as one of the foundations of modern cinema. After her relationship with Rossellini ended, Bergman continued to work with some of the medium\u2019s most creative filmmakers. Her last theatrical film, Ingmar Bergman\u2019s <i>Autumn Sonata<\/i> (1978), brought her back to her native Sweden.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b> <b>Autumn Sonata <\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/7\/f\/c\/600_440370716.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>1978. Sweden. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. With Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullman, Lena Nyman, Halvar Bj\u00f6rk. After seven years of separation, an internationally famous concert pianist (Ingrid Bergman) returns home to visit her long-suffering daughter (Liv Ullman), who has a bagful of bones to pick with her neglectful, self-centered mother. Simmering resentment explodes into a night of mutual recrimination. A difficult collaboration for both director and star, <i>Autumn Sonata<\/i> blends painful material lifted from the lives of both Bergmans with plotting from a Hollywood melodrama.

He was later recognized as a buddha famed for his poetry and songs of spiritual realization. Four hundred years later, a tantric adept emerged from the jungles of Tibet's borderlands, naked, human entrails wound in his dangling dreadlocks. This adept, the Madman, composed a new and novelistic version of the Yogin's life. The story it told of a great Tibetan saint would inspire new forms of religious literature across the Himalayan world, new styles of artistic production, newtraditions of spiritual practice. In time, the Madman's version of the Yogin's life would become Tibet's most famous book. \u00a0<\/p> <p>In this lecture, Professor Andrew Quintman explores the extraordinary life story of Yogin Milarepa, drawing on his new book,<i>The Yogin and the Madman: Reading the Biographical Corpus of Tibet's Great Saint Milarepa<\/i>, tracing its historical formation, changing narrative voices, and enduring legacy across the Tibetan region. He presents a new way of reading<i>The Life of Milarepa\u00a0<\/i>by foregrounding the unique relationship between Yogin and Madman together with the processes through which the narrative took shape.<\/p> <p><b>Suggested Donation:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>$20. \u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/shantidevameditation.org\/become-a-member\/?doing_wp_cron=1438798673.0848579406738281250000\">Shantideva Meditation Center<\/a>,\u00a0Tibet House, and Nalanda Institute Members: $18.)<\/p> <p>Suggested donations may be made online or at the door.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Registration:<\/b><\/p> <p>To register,\u00a0click\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/events.r20.constantcontact.com\/register\/eventReg?oeidk=a07ebd7nppcd77e8434&amp;oseq=&amp;c=&amp;ch=\">here<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>About the Speaker:<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/a\/8\/600_440611656.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.andrewquintman.com\/\">Andrew Quintman<\/a>\u00a0is Associate Professorof Religious Studies at Yale University, specializing in the Buddhist traditions of Tibet and the Himalaya.

We\u2019re fighting pitched battles against tar sands oil, Australian coal mines, and Arctic drilling, not to mention fracking, pipelines, and the companies and portfolios that bankroll them. It\u2019s a battle not just for climate sanity, but for climate justice. And at the same time we\u2019re living through the year that will see the most renewable energy ever installed. There\u2019s suddenly a chance for transformative change on a scale that just might matter.<\/p> <p>But that change requires breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry, and it involves all of us. This is our night to try and set an agenda for the Paris talks and the months beyond them. That crucial conference won\u2019t actually solve our problems -- but it is, however, a great moment to demonstrate the growing, global power of this movement.<\/p> <p>We can\u2019t take this event everywhere across the planet, at least not live. Instead we\u2019re going to record this evening in Brooklyn, and make sure it gets out as widely as is digitally possible. But there will be 2000 of us in the room that night, and I\u2019m very hopeful you\u2019ll be one of them.

We\u2019re fighting pitched battles against tar sands oil, Australian coal mines, and Arctic drilling, not to mention fracking, pipelines, and the companies and portfolios that bankroll them. It\u2019s a battle not just for climate sanity, but for climate justice. And at the same time we\u2019re living through the year that will see the most renewable energy ever installed. There\u2019s suddenly a chance for transformative change on a scale that just might matter.<\/p> <p>But that change requires breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry, and it involves all of us. This is our night to try and set an agenda for the Paris talks and the months beyond them. That crucial conference won\u2019t actually solve our problems -- but it is, however, a great moment to demonstrate the growing, global power of this movement.<\/p> <p>We can\u2019t take this event everywhere across the planet, at least not live. Instead we\u2019re going to record this evening in Brooklyn, and make sure it gets out as widely as is digitally possible. But there will be 2000 of us in the room that night, and I\u2019m very hopeful you\u2019ll be one of them. Tickets are available on a sliding scale, so you can pay what you can afford or think is right. But soon, please, because this will fill up.

Lennox Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus, Eddie Bautista of the New York Environmental Justice Alliance, and a bunch of special guests will be coming together to lay out why this year could be such a dramatic turning point for our movement.<\/p> <p>We\u2019re living through the hottest year in recorded history. We\u2019re fighting pitched battles against tar sands oil, Australian coal mines, and Arctic drilling, not to mention fracking, pipelines, and the companies and portfolios that bankroll them. It\u2019s a battle not just for climate sanity, but for climate justice. And at the same time we\u2019re living through the year that will see the most renewable energy ever installed. There\u2019s suddenly a chance for transformative change on a scale that just might matter.<\/p> <p>But that change requires breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry, and it involves all of us. This is our night to try and set an agenda for the Paris talks and the months beyond them. That crucial conference won\u2019t actually solve our problems -- but it is, however, a great moment to demonstrate the growing, global power of this movement.<\/p> <p>We can\u2019t take this event everywhere across the planet, at least not live. Instead we\u2019re going to record this evening in Brooklyn, and make sure it gets out as widely as is digitally possible. But there will be 2000 of us in the room that night, and I\u2019m very hopeful you\u2019ll be one of them. Tickets are available on a sliding scale, so you can pay what you can afford or think is right. But soon, please, because this will fill up.

It's not an award winner (yet!) or a best seller (yet!), but it has made a tremendous splash on the literary scene for a local writer. A mere month after the novel's release came this announcement:\"Tony Award-winning actress Anika Noni Rose has optioned TV\/film rights to Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older\u2019s urban fantasy series Bone Street Rumba. <a href=\"http:\/\/deadline.com\/2015\/01\/anika-noni-rose-bone-street-rumba-1201353922\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/deadline.com\/2015\/01\/anika-noni-rose-bone-street-rumba-1201353922\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/deadline.com\/2015\/01\/anika-noni-rose-bone-street-rumba-1201353922\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nFrom Goodreads:<br\/>Carlos Delacruz is one of the New York Council of the Dead\u2019s most unusual agents\u2014an inbetweener, partially resurrected from a death he barely recalls suffering, after a life that\u2019s missing from his memory. He thinks he is one of a kind\u2014until he encounters other entities walking the fine line between life and death.\u00a0<br\/>One inbetweener is a sorcerer. He\u2019s summoned a horde of implike ngks capable of eliminating spirits, and they\u2019re spreading through the city like a plague. They\u2019ve already taken out some of NYCOD\u2019s finest, leaving Carlos desperate to stop their master before he opens up the entrada to the Underworld\u2014which would destroy the balance between the living and the dead.<br\/>But in uncovering this man\u2019s identity, Carlos confronts the truth of his own life\u2014and death\u2026<\/p> <p>Some questions to keep in mind as you're reading:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Older is playing with multiple literary traditions: urban fantasy, horror, noir. How sucessfully do you feel these traditions blend in this novel? How have each of these traditions been subverted to serve Older's purposes?<\/p> <p>\u2022 Carlos could be said to be a flawed main character, yet generally likeable. What makes him an engaging character to tell this particular story? Were you frustrated by anything he did? What were is flaws, and how did they enhance or impede the story?<\/p> <p>\u2022 While some books, specifically urban fantasy books, either keep their settings vague or take license with their \"real-world\" settings, Half-Resurrection Blues takes full advantage of a very specific setting, the neighborhoods around Prospect Park in Brooklyn, to infuse the work with hyper-real detail.

They live in a tiny, 11-foot-square soundproofed cell in a converted shed in the kidnapper's yard. The sociopath, whom Jack has dubbed Old Nick, visits at night, grudgingly doling out food and supplies. Seen entirely through Jack's eyes and childlike perceptions, the developments in this novel-there are enough plot twists to provide a dramatic arc of breathtaking suspense-are astonishing. Ma, as Jack calls her, proves to be resilient and resourceful, creating exercise games, makeshift toys, and reading and math lessons to fill their days.<\/p> <p><br\/>Room has been made into a major motion picture that will be in theaters this coming October.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BkTqhVIYbZQ\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BkTqhVIYbZQ<\/a><\/p> <p>Novels at Night is\u00a0 a book club for adults 21 years and older who enjoy reading and sharing their opinions about books.

(Joshua 7:10)\u00a0 Once revealed, we need to confess our sins to Him (and repent of them) and, if appropriate, to those whom we offended.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to assume the sins of the nation on ourselves; just as Daniel did for the sins of the nation of Israel (Daniel 9).<\/p> <p>3.\u00a0 It is absolutely crucial that in all these endeavors that prayer be our primary focus.\u00a0 We need to rely on prayer (Jesus) as the foundation for everything that we do.\u00a0 In addition, prayer teams need to be set up that will pray before, during, and after all events, etc. in order to bath in prayer everything that we do.\u00a0 These prayer teams will be the \u201cheavy lifters\u201d who will be moving heaven and earth for us as we fight to regain our nation.<\/p> <p>4.\u00a0 We should follow (among other prayers in the Word), the prayers of repentance and requests for restoration that we find in the Bible, as we pray for our nation.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Focus:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 Jesus is the only way and the only power that will enable our nation to turn around (2 Cor 7:14). We need to focus on Him and to trust in Him alone, as we confess and turn from our sins; that He will tear down the strongholds of the enemy in our nation and in our individual lives. \u201cWhen the enemy comes in; like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.\u201d (Isa 59:19). We must not trust in any tactic, procedure, or whatever in order to overcome the devil (who is behind all of the evil that we see around us). \u201cFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\u201d Ephesians 6:11-13<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 We need to ensure that we stay focused.\u00a0 The enemy (Satan) will try different tactics against us, e.g., to get our focus off of that which is most important and to either divert our attention on that which is least important and\/or try to get us to do too much.\u00a0 He will probably try to bring division amongst us.\u00a0 My guess is that it would be through misunderstandings, hurt feelings, etc.\u00a0 We must be aware of this up-front, expecting the attacks and to realize that the attacks are coming from the enemy and not from what we can, e.g., see with our natural eyes.<\/p> <p><b>Prayer Tactics:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.\u00a0 We need to find appropriate Scriptures to stand upon to bring before the Lord as we pray individually and corporately.\u00a0 It is crucial that we not follow a hard fast cook book approach; even one that is based on the Bible.\u00a0 We need to know what the Scriptures say and then to allow the Holy Spirit to use what He\u2019s taught us to do or to pray those things that He brings to mind or puts into our hearts to do.\u00a0 For example, don\u2019t have the \u201cHail Mary\u201d prayer approach, e.g., I always have to pray this way or to pray these prayers in this exact order.<\/p> <p>2.\u00a0 The Church needs to be actively involved in politics and other social endeavors such as education, health care, the legal system, etc. (if even just knowing what is going on). In politics, the Body should then intelligently and with Christ-like love contact their representatives making their viewpoints known.\u00a0 These godly leaders need to then rally the Body perhaps at local auditoriums, stadiums, etc. in order show the Church the truth about how our nation began and how the Church was actively involved in all facets of social life for the first few hundred years of our pre- and post-national existence.\u00a0 The Body needs to learn that we must stand on what God\u2019s Word says and to fight for what\u2019s ours (just as the Israelites entered the Promised Land, fought huge giants, and won).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Finally, remember:<\/p> <p>2 Chron 16:9 \u201cFor the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him\u2026\u201d<\/p> <p><b>PREPARATION FOR PRAYER-STUDY MATERIALS<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Repentance from Idolatry<\/b><\/p> <p>All the sins described below are the symptoms of a bigger sickness, which is denying God as our creator and not glorifying him and acknowledging him as the supreme ruler of the universe. Rom 1:29 states \u201cAll Unrighteousness\u201d stems out from the root of idolatry (Rom1:23). So, fornication is not a sickness, it is one of the symptoms of idolatry, covetousness is not a sickness, it is another symptom of idolatry, etc.<\/p> <p>It is very important to focus our prayer efforts on this first cause of sin, which is ignoring God, suppressing the truth, and replacing the Creator by the created. God and truth are self-evident, but we choose to rebel against it. What we need is to repent from that.<\/p> <p>Studying the nature of repentance would help tremendously in our efforts to pray and intercede for people because repentance is the key to come back to God and be healed.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:18\u00a0 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:19\u00a0 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it<\/i> unto them.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:20\u00a0 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even<\/i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:21\u00a0 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him<\/i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:22\u00a0 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:23\u00a0 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:24\u00a0 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:25\u00a0 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:26\u00a0 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:27\u00a0 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<\/p> <p>Rom 1:28\u00a0 And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their<\/i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<\/p> <p>Rom 1:29\u00a0 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:30\u00a0 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<\/p> <p>Rom 1:31\u00a0 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<\/p> <p>Rom 1:32\u00a0 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s an example of what causes repentance:<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America focus on the much that we have, so our hearts is filled with thanksgiving for his goodness towards us, and our hearts lead us to repentance.<\/p> <p>Rom_2:4\u00a0 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that the end result of America\u2019s tribulations, the recession, the aging and health deterioration of Americans, the financial distress, etc. work for our good, changing our hearts and drawing closer to God.<\/p> <p>2Co_7:10\u00a0 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that America realize that God wants every American to be saved and not face judgment. Let\u2019s pray that our pastors emphasize the human responsibility in determining our final destiny<\/p> <p>2Pe_3:9\u00a0 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<\/p> <p>Other observations on the word Repentance<\/p> <p>The word repentance is used in connection with God, as well as with man. When it is used in connection with God, it is usually positive. God never repents to do good for his people. God repents himself from exercising judgment and punishment on his people.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that God will change his mind executing the punishment that we deserve.<\/p> <p>Num_23:19\u00a0 God <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i>it?<\/i> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<\/p> <p>1Sa_15:29\u00a0 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <i>is<\/i> not a man, that he should repent.<\/p> <p>Psa_110:4\u00a0 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art<\/i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.<\/p> <p>Psa_135:14\u00a0 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.<\/p> <p>Jer_18:8\u00a0 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<\/p> <p>Satan is the God of this world. He endows his faithful servants with power to promote sin from the top down. In that sense, it is very important to know that sin is not based on grass root strategies; it is a highly organized well-funded push strategy.<\/p> <p>Blindness comes from Satan.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray in the Name of Jesus and bind Satan\u2019s power, rebuke his authority, and order him to take away his hands off America. Let\u2019s pray that the spiritual veil be torn and people be able to see what\u2019s evident.<\/p> <p>2Co_4:4\u00a0 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<\/p> <p><b>Joh 12:40<\/b>\u00a0 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their<\/i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their<\/i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<\/p> <p>The realization of our sinful nature comes when we get in contact with God the Holy Spirit, and his different manifestations. In that sense, we are also empowered to expose sin because the Holy Spirit dwells in us and we can testify of him through our actions.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that God produces growth in us, and the works of faith that glorify Him \u201cin us\u201d serve as testimony that he lives. Let\u2019s pray that the Holy Spirit be poured over America, so people be able to experience his conviction and turn away from idolatry.<\/p> <p><b>Joh 16:8<\/b>\u00a0 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<\/p> <p>Isa 6:5\u00a0 Then said I, Woe <i>is<\/i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am<\/i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<\/p> <p>Luk 5:8\u00a0 When Simon Peter saw <i>it,<\/i> he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<\/p> <p>Let\u2019s pray that we Christians devote our time reading the Word of God, so he continues the process of sanctification and purification.

We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.<\/p> <p>7 \u201cLord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame\u2014the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 8 We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, LORD, because we have sinned against you. 9 The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 10 we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. 11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.<\/p> <p>\u201cTherefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 12 You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 13 Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. 14 The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.<\/p> <p>15 \u201cNow, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 16 Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem (America) and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.<\/p> <p>17 \u201cNow, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 18 Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 19 Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name. \u201d<\/p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 9):<\/b><\/p> <p>After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, \u201cThe people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. 2 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.\u201d<\/p> <p>3 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.<\/p> <p>5 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God 6 and prayed:<\/p> <p>\u201cI am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 7 From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today\u2026<\/p> <p>10 \u201cBut now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 11 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: \u2018The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.\u2019<\/p> <p>13 \u201cWhat has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 14 Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 15 LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.\u201d<\/p> <p>5.\u00a0 Pray that the Lord will rise up godly pastors (or Church leaders) who will agree to work together to preach and teach on preparing the Church, e.g., to first of all pray and fast for our nation in small and large gatherings (at work during lunch hour, at home, in parks, at church, at social gatherings, etc.) around our nation; asking the Lord to have mercy on America (as we, as Christians confess our sins of idolatry, ambivalence, etc. to Him.\u00a0 Also, these leaders should teach of the need for the Church to be actively involved in the world (to be the salt and the light of the world).\u00a0 But, everything - absolutely everything should be focused on love; the Father\u2019s agape love being shown to the world.\u00a0 \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u00a0 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\u201d (John 13:[masked])<\/p> <p>As an example of a godly leader raising the awareness of God\u2019s people to gather together in repentance, is Ezra:<\/p> <p><b>Excerpts from the Book of Ezra (Chapter 10):<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cWhile Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites\u2014men, women and children\u2014gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 2 Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, \u201cWe have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 3 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 4 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.\u201d<\/p> <p>5 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.<\/p> <p>7 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 8 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.<\/p> <p>9 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, \u201cYou have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel\u2019s guilt. 11 Now honor[a] the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.\u201d<\/p> <p>12 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: \u201cYou are right! We must do as you say. 13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 14 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.\u201d 15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.<\/p> <p>16 So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, 17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Christian-Party-of-America-NY\/events\/225132944\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Prayer For Our Nation","id":"qclpsjytmbnb","time":1441931400000,"updated":1441943597000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1305604485000,"name":"Christian Party of America (NY)","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1871871,"urlname":"Christian-Party-of-America-NY","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Christian Constitutionalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Astoria","address_1":"27-16 23rd Avenue ","name":"Q.E.D.","lon":-73.91507,"id":22755932,"state":"NY","lat":40.775856,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.31769657135,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441650179000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/a\/0\/d\/600_441734861.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Hey - I'm putting on a comedy show with all the strangest standup comedians I could find!

curtain that keeps us all in the dark, and reveal the puppet masters and their devious plan for the human race. \u00a0We all know that something is wrong with today\u2019s world and whether we like to admit it or not, we can all sense that something dark is coming. \u00a0However, unlike what you may have heard before, this broadcast will reveal the shocking truth about this darkness. \u00a0You will hear who is in power, how they came to be so, and what their plan is for the future of humanity. \u00a0But more specifically Master Teacher Qesankh will expose the secrets behind:<\/p>

they back to you<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 If George Orwell was right about Big Brother<\/p> <p>Of course, you are probably aware that revealing the truths of our current predicament is just one level of understanding. \u00a0In fact, many speakers use it as a scare tactic to secure engagements and sell books. \u00a0Yet these very same speakers offer no solid solutions and many times are paid to spread disinformation. \u00a0Master Teacher Qesankh will go further than other speakers by revealing specific techniques as to how you can awaken the God within to harness incredible power. \u00a0With it, we can counter the sinister plans of the elite. \u00a0Poverty, oppression, and pain can be severely reduced in our own lifetimes by this approach. \u00a0For it is only through the human race working together to achieve our full potential that we can counteract these plans for our destruction.<\/p> <p>Join The Revolution!<\/p> <p>The Global Conspiracy to Destroy The Human Race<\/p> <p>Thursday,

You get a wide experience here- from the traditional eastern religions and philosophies to a modern sense of spirtuality and perception, and also a perfect blend of the two together. That sound snooty enough for you? All that aside, they have beautiful collections here, both ancient and modern art. Plus they have a trendy lounge with food, drinks, and a DJ. And you know what else? It's free- Yep, free, every Friday night from 6-10pm. You can't beat that- get some culture, get some food, and maybe get some groovin' to the music. For an added bonus, there's a happy hour from 6-7pm, 2-for-1 drink specials. They even allow us into the downstairs gallery while still enjoying our drinks. I don't know about you, but art appreciation seems a little easier with a drink in your hand.<\/p> <p>For those of you that won't be able to make it at 6pm, that's fine. The museum has a fairly simple layout and it shouldn't be too dificult to meet up when you get there.<\/p> <p>So the plan is: arrive when you can, enjoy the happy hour if you get there before it ends, check out some really interesting art, and do all that while getting to know some good people. Sounds like a great plan to me.<\/p> <p><i>A little about the Museum from their website:<\/i> The Rubin Museum of Art is home to a comprehensive collection of art from the Himalayas and surrounding regions. The artistic heritage of this vast and culturally varied area of the world remains relatively obscure. Through changing exhibitions and an array of engaging public programs, the museum offers opportunities to explore the artistic legacy of the Himalayan region and to appreciate its place in the context of world cultures.<\/p> <p>The museum's collection consists of paintings, sculptures, and textiles. Although works of art range in date over two millennia, most reflect major periods and schools of Himalayan art from the twelfth century onward.<\/p> <p>The exhibitions are organized with particular care to assist viewers who are new to Himalayan art. Wall texts and interpretive panels supply aesthetic, social, and historical perspectives to both scholars and casual viewers. The Explore Art Galleries on the third and fifth floors (with a video alcove on the sixth floor) take the viewer behind the scenes, answering questions about why and for whom the art was made. Books, paintings, photographs, artifacts, and computer terminals accessing the museum's website and affiliated sites offer other examples of Himalayan and related art.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/justnotalone\/events\/225085672\/","yes_rsvp_count":79,"name":"The Rubin Museum of Art","id":"225085672","time":1442008800000,"updated":1442100982000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1280096744000,"name":"I wanted to do that...Just not alone!!","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1680805,"urlname":"justnotalone","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"401 W 25th St","name":"Pushcart Coffee","lon":-74.001282,"id":23767881,"lat":40.748158,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":0.605436503887,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432902573000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us in North Chelsea at Pushcart Coffee for knitting, crocheting, good pastries, great coffee and craft beer.

Feel free to ask me questions about what supplies to bring by commenting below or messaging Janna Maria Vallee.<\/p> <p>Pushcart Coffee closes at 8:30pm<\/p> <p>We would love to see\/support your progress at other meetups throughout the month!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Pints-N-Purls\/events\/222866238\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":10800000,"name":"Knitting at Pushcart Coffee with free beginner knitting instruction from Janna","id":"bzpjhlytmbnb","time":1442008800000,"updated":1442021936000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1276651371000,"name":"NYC Pints 'n' Purls","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1661860,"urlname":"NYC-Pints-N-Purls","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Happy-Hour Hookers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"150 West 17th Street New York, NY 10011","name":"Rubin Museum of Art Lounge","lon":-73.997795,"id":1594102,"state":"NY","lat":40.740017,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.803348362446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1340583015000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>PLEASE RSVP ON DHARMA DRINK MEETUP PAGE (www.dharmadrink.com - thank you!)<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>A great way to get Dharma connected in New York!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Meeting monthly at the Rubin during the summer - but special events will be announced like \"Dharma Drink at the Beach or the Park\" plus special group visits to see amazing teachers as the come to NYC over the summer! \u00a0Should be awesome!!!<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>For people interested in Buddhism or meditation or just leading a kinder life who are up for meeting like minded people.<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Dharma Drink is now Self Service!<\/i><\/p> <p>The table is always reserved in the same spot - just show up and see what happens \u00a0- just like if you were hanging out meeting other Buddhists randomly in Kathamandu or India.

There\u2019s a whole culture of hawker food that is sold in large, open-air malls in Singapore called hawker centers. Very little of this will be recognizable to a Western palate: Hainanese chicken rice, Hokkien noodles, grilled skate, lamb curry, carrot cake (which is neither carrot nor cake!), oyster omelet, things smothered in shrimp paste and lots more cheap, classic street food. It\u2019s all to be found at a new restaurant from chef Simpson Wong, Chomp Chomp, 7 Cornelia St. [masked]), which scored a review in the Aug. 3 New Yorker. Sylvia Killingsworth says Wong\u2019s goal is \u201cless to intimidate you with spice than to woo you with depth of flavor. The eclectic assortment of dishes has influences from China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.\u201d We are nothing if not eclectic, and Allen Chan, Fast and Fab\u2019s own transplanted Singaporean, guides us through the hawker menu. Meet at the restaurant at 6 on the evening in question; a viewing of \u201cShaun the Sheep\u201d later the same evening is not out of the question.

Enjoy the rare chance to go 30 feet beneath the streets into the historic lagering tunnels of a long-shuttered brewery, now home to Crown Height's own affineur: Crown Finish Caves. Small batch drinks and cheeses included in ticket price as well as delicious local nibbles prepared by \"Snail of Approval\" caterers Pixie and the Scout. Books available for purchase and signing by the author.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/rerum-18385.ticketbud.com\/art_of_cheese\">Cheesemaking Workshops<\/a><br\/>All workshops focus on natural techniques that can easily be reproduced at home or at small scale cheesemaking facilities. Participants will learn how to take the steps to make their cheeses more naturally, without packaged starters, additives and chemicals, and how to source the best possible milk for their cheesemaking. Workshops are demonstration style -we all make cheese together round the table. Each workshop is limited to 20 participants. A signed copy of Mr. Asher's book, <a href=\"http:\/\/media.chelseagreen.com\/the-art-of-natural-cheesemaking\">The Art of Natural Cheesemaking<\/a>, is included in the workshop ticket price.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/rerum-18385.ticketbud.com\/art_of_cheese\">\"Rennet Free Cheesemaking\" <\/a><br\/>SATURDAY, SEPT 12 - 10AM TO 1PM<br\/>Learn to make great cheese without rennet. This class looks at two styles of cheesemaking: lactic cheeses and heat - acid cheeses. See the secrets to making great Paneer (AKA Queso Fresco), yogurt and yogurt cheese. And all entirely naturally.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/rerum-18385.ticketbud.com\/art_of_cheese\">\"Ch\u00e8vre and Mouldy Goat Cheeses\" <\/a><br\/>SATURDAY, SEPT 12 - 2PM TO 5PM<br\/>Fresh Ch\u00e8vre is the starting point for this workshop - a simple cheese that is a breeze to make at home. Participants will then learn how to prepare mouldy aged goats cheeses like Crottin, Saint Valencay and Saint Marcellin from the very same Ch\u00e8vre curd.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/rerum-18385.ticketbud.com\/art_of_cheese\">\"Introduction to Rennet Cheesemaking\" <\/a><br\/>SUNDAY, SEPT 13 - 10AM TO 1PM<br\/>An introductory course that looks into the making of basic rennet cheese curd, the foundational recipe from which nearly every type of rennet cheese evolves, including Camembert, which will also be explored in this class. As the curd sets, we'll make a batch of yogurt cheese - a super simple technique, and a great cheese to start with. Kefir, a multifaceted probiotic and cheesemaking starter culture, will also be covered.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/rerum-18385.ticketbud.com\/art_of_cheese\">\"Rennet Cheesemaking Part II\" <\/a><br\/>SUNDAY, SEPT 13 - 2PM TO 5PM<br\/>A survey course that demonstrates the making of a broad range of cheeses that evolve from the basic rennet curds made in the Introduction to Natural Cheesemaking class. Participants will learn how to grow white rinds on their Camembert, how to make their cheeses Blue, how to transform them into stinky Limburger too, and lets not forget Feta and Mozzarella. We will also explore the making of Tomme, a firm alpine cheese from the foothills of the Alps. And all of these will be made without packaged starter cultures!<\/p> <p>This event series is a collaboration between Crown Finish Caves and Slow Food USA.

For this event, we are focusing on fashion technology.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Why attend Startup Weekend?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Education:<\/b> Startup Weekends are all about learning through the act of creating. Don\u2019t just listen to theory, build your own strategy and test it as you go.<\/p> <p><b>Build your network:<\/b> This isn\u2019t just a happy-hour. Startup Weekend attracts your community\u2019s best makers and do-ers. By spending a weekend working to build scalable companies that solve real-world problems, you will build long-lasting relationships and possibly walk away with a job or even an investor.<\/p> <p><b>Find a co-founder:<\/b> We all know it\u2019s not just about the idea \u2013 it\u2019s about the team. Startup Weekend is hands down the best way to find someone you can actually launch a startup with.<\/p> <p><b>Learn something new:<\/b> Step outside of your comfort zone. With a whole weekend dedicated to letting your creative juices flow, Startup Weekends are perfect opportunities to work on a new platform, learn a new programming language, or just try something different.<\/p> <p><b>Get face time with thought leaders:<\/b> Local tech and startup leaders participate in Startup Weekends as coaches and judges. Get some one-on-one time with the movers and shakers in your community. Actually launch a business: Over 36% of Startup Weekend startups are still going strong after 3 months. Roughly 80% of participants plan on continuing working with their team or startup after the weekend.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Who should attend Startup Weekend Global Fashion Battle?<\/b><\/p> <p>It doesn't matter if you are in the fashion industry or not. Come with an open mind and get ready to build something truly amazing and innovative. If you are in the fashion industry (eg: designer, buyer, seller, marketing, sales, advertising, PR, front of house, back of house, etc) or not (eg: mobile designer, application developer, business development, sales, student, teacher, etc), you are most welcome to participate in the weekend.<\/p> <p><b>Do I need to come with an idea?<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have an idea for a startup, then great! We hope you pitch for the weekend. If you don't have an idea, thats quite alright! Come and spend the weekend, listen to the ideas being pitched and maybe something strikes your interest. The weekend is all about learning about the startup ideation process and learning from each other.<\/p> <p>If you have more questions, checkout the <a href=\"http:\/\/startupweekend.org\/about\/firsttimer\/\">Startup Weekend First Timers FAQ<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/a\/5\/600_441814213.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/c\/d\/600_441005325.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/d\/600_441022589.jpeghttp:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/4\/600_441022596.jpeghttp:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/6\/600_441022598.jpeghttp:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/b\/600_441022603.jpeghttp:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/f\/600_441022607.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/b\/4\/600_441814228.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/OpenSourceFashion\/events\/225242564\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":176400000,"name":"Global Startup Fashion Battle","id":"225242564","time":1442012400000,"updated":1442190901000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1288634629000,"name":"Open Source Fashion","group_lon":-74,"id":1731294,"urlname":"OpenSourceFashion","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Fashion Innovators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"150 West 17th Street","name":"Rubin Museum of Art - K2 Lounge \/ Cafe Serai","lon":-73.997696,"id":13020222,"state":"NY","lat":40.740124,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.794100344181,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430456489000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>An opportunity for everyone in Bodhi Lounge to meet and social with one another and other like minded people. \u00a0This will be a joint social with the Dharma Drink group.<\/p> <p>Time: 7-?pm<\/p> <p>Place: Rubin Museum Lounge, 17th Street and 7th Avenue<br\/>How to find us: Look for a table with the small sign \"Dharma Drink\" + Lounge staff will know where we are.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Ask the museum staff for the Buddhist social group!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bodhi-Lounge\/events\/225036178\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Happy Hour at Serai in Rubin Museum","id":"psxtglytmbpb","time":1442012400000,"updated":1442021270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1257292978000,"name":"Bodhi Lounge | Where Bodhisattvas Chill","group_lon":-74,"id":1551314,"urlname":"Bodhi-Lounge","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Bodhisattvas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10010","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"15 Gramercy Park South","name":"The National Arts Club","lon":-73.986702,"id":15895142,"state":"NY","lat":40.737694,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":0.869528889656,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439856470000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/4\/e\/600_436925198.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>All levels are welcomed.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our sessions are 2.5 hours with a long break in the middle.

And at the end of each story, all three mothers emerge from their private crucibles with an understanding \u2014 though one that can only be expressed in a way that erupts into the film\u2019s very reality.<\/p> <p>In the film\u2019s first story, a mother (Maria J\u00falia, played by famed Brazilian actress, singer and performer Cida Moreira), learns about her son\u2019s most intimate secret maybe a minute too late. On the second tale, an enigmatically afflicted sound engineer (Eduardo, played by R\u00f4mulo Braga) skulks through his day of nausea and confusion, while his wife Silvia (Andr\u00e9a Marquee) muses on the scope of infant wisdom with a friend, as the two gaze at the former\u2019s child. What happens next throws both parents into a state of trauma. The last story follows Jo\u00e3o (Henrique Schafer) and Ana (Fernanda Vianna), on their preparations to re-encounter their long-lost son.<\/p> <p>Portuguese with English subtitles \/ Running time:\u00a097 minutes \/ Year:\u00a02013<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrazilianPortuguese\/events\/225260447\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Movie Night: O Que Se Move (The Moving Creatures)","id":"225260447","time":1442012400000,"updated":1442031191000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1144290808000,"name":"The New York Brazilian Portuguese Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":232129,"urlname":"BrazilianPortuguese","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Brazilians & Portuguese speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"43 West 23rd Street, 2nd Floor","name":"Rise","lon":-73.991081,"id":24080303,"state":"NY","lat":40.742615,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.514585971832,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439783984000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/9\/4\/4\/600_395122852.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>TICKETS:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-weekend-nyc-global-fashion-battle-tickets-18142098505?discount=meetup\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-weekend-nyc-global-fashion-battle-tickets-18142098505\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/startup-weekend-nyc-global-fashion-battle-tickets-18142098505<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>NYC Event:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.up.co\/communities\/usa\/nyc\/startup-weekend\/7258\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.up.co\/communities\/usa\/nyc\/startup-weekend\/7258\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.up.co\/communities\/usa\/nyc\/startup-weekend\/7258<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>More info about the Global Battle:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/globalfashionbattle.co\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/globalfashionbattle.co\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Join us for the next Startup Weekend, Global Fashion Battle! This event will focus around fashion technology. What is fashion technology? In a broad sense, it\u2019s when fashion\u00a0(what we wear, what we aspire to be, how we present ourselves to society through clothing) meets technology (innovation, a digital presence, engaging online &amp; mobile content.) It\u2019s fashion embracing a new and digital component to sell \/ present their business model. It\u2019s where technology and fashion have merged to create faster and more innovative ways to shop, market, educate and ultimately experience the fashion industry whether through software, apps or products. From e-commerce to 3D printing to wearables, fashion technology covers a wide spectrum of applicable use cases.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/c\/d\/600_441005325.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/3\/d\/600_441022589.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/4\/600_441022596.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/6\/600_441022598.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/b\/600_441022603.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/8\/4\/f\/600_441022607.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Startup-Weekend-NYC\/events\/224684606\/","yes_rsvp_count":69,"duration":180000000,"name":"Startup Weekend NYC Fashion Tech Edition","id":"224684606","time":1442012400000,"updated":1442194782000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1388072553000,"name":"Startup Weekend NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":11571552,"urlname":"Startup-Weekend-NYC","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Entrepreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":1.25659668446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1441745558000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>3 Bars, 3 Languages, 3 cultural drinks.

Meditation helps us stabilize our mind and understand the world in a way that is beneficial to ourselves and others. Through Shamatha (\"Calm Abiding\"), we can gain control of our mind by reducing automatic reactions to thoughts, allowing them to arise and subside on their own. In doing so we can develop the natural calmness needed to investigate and gain clear insight about the true nature of the outer world and our own mind, or the wisdom of enlightenment\u00a0(Vipashyana).<\/p> <p>Khenchen will give instructions on how to practice Shamatha and Vipashyana, and lead a guided meditation.

Screenwriter Rita Mae Brown, better known for her feminist fiction, intended for her script to be played as a satire but director Amy Jones instead plays it straight. As a formula slasher film, it's not bad. Characterizations tend towards the formulaic but Brown shows a better understanding of female relationships and banter than her male counterparts usually do. The young female leads are pleasant but mostly interchangeable: the standout performances come from Jennifer Meyers as an amusingly bratty kid sister and Michael Villella as the sweaty, bug-eyed killer. Jones imitates a lot of the stylistic tics John Carpenter displayed in Halloween (prowling camerawork, an ominous synthesizer score, using suburban settings to ironically creepy effect) and builds a decent amount of suspense. She doesn't shy away from sleaze (a gratuitous shower scene is taken to self-parodic extremes) and creates an effectively tense and bloody finale. In short, The Slumber Party Massacre isn't likely to interest anyone outside the horror movie fanbase but those fans will find it to be a solid little programmer.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVkY09sUTq0\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVkY09sUTq0<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the upstairs bar\/lobby","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/225051358\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Slumber Party Massacre 35mm film print Midnight movie","id":"225051358","time":1442028600000,"updated":1442040106000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto - The NY Cult Film Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":1810145,"urlname":"MondoCulto","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Mondo Cultists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":2,"distance":12.0630092621,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441578751000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join me for a great workout while beating the crowds with the potential for an awesome sunrise :)!<\/p> <p>Please follow the two golden rules :)<\/p> <p>1) Hike Safe !<\/p> <p>2) Have Fun!<\/p> <p>\u00a0Directions :NY Route 9D, look for Bob's Corner Store in Beacon.

The northern peak is 1531ft and has a series of radio antennas on its summit. The higher southern peak is 1610ft and has a lookout tower on its summit. On a clear morning we will see the NYC skyline lights from the summit as well as views of the town of Beacon and the majority of the Highlands (including Storm King, Breakneck Ridge, and little Sugarloaf).<\/p> <p><br\/>You agree when you sign up for this group or any of the events that you have read and understand the below.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you join us for a hike (or any other event), please understand that you are responsible for your own preparedness and well-being and will hold no one else liable in case of injury or mishap.

After focusing on Orchard Beach for several years, and a subsequent cleanup at Playland and Rye Beaches in May of 2014.<\/p> <p><br\/>This year we are moving the beach cleanup to Glen Island Park in New Rochelle on September 12th. Which will coincide with International Beach Cleanup Day. North East Divers Unite will be open to the public and (certified) scuba divers.<\/p> <p>Free parking in Glen Island Park\u00b4s main lot for registered volunteers.<\/p> <p>BBQ starts at 2:00 for qualifying volunteers.<\/p> <p>Help Remove Excess Debris From Long Island Sound Shores<\/p> <p>Contribute to a cleaner New York, by joining The Scuba Sports Club TSSC in their continuing efforts to rid the Long Island Sound of debris, and man\u2013made waste. Afterwards celebrate your efforts at the get\u2013together to follow the cleanup! Collect three pounds of trash at the beach cleanup, and gain entry to the barbecue.<\/p> <p>Volunteers Needed!<\/p> <p>You can help us make this event a great success!<\/p> <p>Like last year, we will have divers in the water as well as clean\u2013up crews along the shore, on the beach and in the grassy areas. You do not need to be a scuba diver to participate! Bring your families and friends, we need as many volunteers as possible, as the area is extensive.

As a young executive in finance during the 1990's, Rossman was an early champion of developing markets, investing in the newly emerging countries of Latin America and Asia far ahead of the crowd. Following Communism's collapse, Rossman took a key role at the leading Turkish Investment Bank, Global Securities, in bringing American capital and investment to the developing markets of the Former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Turkey and North Africa. By assisting in the privatization process within Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, Rossman became an important link between Western capital and know-how in the early stages of modernizing these formally closed economic systems. First as an institutional advisor, and then as an independent consultant, he continued to advocate the sustainable development of democratic and stable free market institutions and expanding economic opportunity throughout the region. More recently, Rossman has provided a similar advisory role to major holding companies and financial institutions in the Middle East seeking to most effectively navigate through the volatility of the current financial crisis.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Mr. Rossman has spoken on these topics at conferences around the world in such diverse places as London, New York, Istanbul, Baku, Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Stockholm, Washington D.C. and Houston and he has lived in both Turkey and Kuwait.

As a young executive in finance during the 1990's, Rossman was an early champion of developing markets, investing in the newly emerging countries of Latin America and Asia far ahead of the crowd. Following Communism's collapse, Rossman took a key role at the leading Turkish Investment Bank, Global Securities, in bringing American capital and investment to the developing markets of the Former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Turkey and North Africa. By assisting in the privatization process within Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, Rossman became an important link between Western capital and know-how in the early stages of modernizing these formally closed economic systems. First as an institutional advisor, and then as an independent consultant, he continued to advocate the sustainable development of democratic and stable free market institutions and expanding economic opportunity throughout the region. More recently, Rossman has provided a similar advisory role to major holding companies and financial institutions in the Middle East seeking to most effectively navigate through the volatility of the current financial crisis.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Mr. Rossman has spoken on these topics at conferences around the world in such diverse places as London, New York, Istanbul, Baku, Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Stockholm, Washington D.C. and Houston and he has lived in both Turkey and Kuwait.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/225182915\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Back to School Shoot w\/Lexi & Alyssa - Sept. 12th","id":"225182915","time":1442073600000,"updated":1442163561000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Staten Island","address_1":"148 Willard Ave ","name":"Westerleigh  park ","lon":-74.13386,"id":24077240,"lat":40.619644,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.7686977386,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441628393000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>All are welcome to this free event with Patrick n Friends.

My approach is a combination of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and Buddhist principles, with a healthy dose of compassion and understanding!<\/p> <p>Our meetups are held in Union Square, near 12th Street and University Place.<\/p> <p>Please give me a call or email me if you think you might be interested in attending the meet-ups or in learning more about individual or group therapy.

But you can leave earlier, of course.<\/p> <p><br\/>COST: Whatever you pay for the museum (as little as $1 or less) and for lunch; plus $2 for me, in part to cover Meetup's recently increased organizer fee.<\/p> <p>TRANSPORTATION: 4,6 train (No 5 today) to 86th St. Then walk west to 5th Ave and south to 82nd St. For more details, consult hopstop.com, mta.tripplanner.org, or both, since each is occasionally inaccurate. Also check mta.info\/weekender for weekend service changes.<\/p> <p>LUNCH: We'll eat in the Met cafeteria, starting at around\u00a02 PM. You can bring your own lunch if you wish, but I would recommend buying at least a drink, as a courtesy.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be wearing a red cap","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-walks-Nature-beauty-peace\/events\/225175697\/","yes_rsvp_count":82,"name":"Metropolitan Museum and Central Park (Williamsburg rained out)","id":"225175697","time":1442075400000,"updated":1442120818000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1319308157000,"name":"NYC walks: Nature, beauty, & peace","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":2691312,"urlname":"NYC-walks-Nature-beauty-peace","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Bryant Park","name":"Bryant Park","lon":-73.982574,"id":22523442,"state":"NY","lat":40.754169,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.484599530697,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1412077445000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>THE SEPTEMBER 12TH MEETING LOCATION IS AT BRYANT PARK,\u00a0ON THE PLAZA SEATING AREA AT 6TH AVE.

Kandel,\u00a0<i>The Age of Insight<\/i>\u00a0takes us to Vienna 1900, where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind\u2014our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions\u2014and how mind and brain relate to art.\u00a0<br\/>Gustav Klimt, Oscar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele created startlingly evocative and honest portraits that expressed unconscious lust, desire, anxiety, and the fear of death.\u00a0<br\/>Kandel tells the story of how these pioneers\u2014Freud, Schnitzler, Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele\u2014inspired by the Vienna School of Medicine, in turn influenced the founders of the Vienna School of Art History to ask pivotal questions such as What does the viewer bring to a work of art? How does the beholder respond to it? These questions prompted new and ongoing discoveries in psychology and brain biology, leading to revelations about how we see and perceive, how we think and feel, and how we respond to and create works of art. Kandel, one of the leading scientific thinkers of our time, places these five innovators in the context of today\u2019s cutting-edge science and gives us a new understanding of the modernist art of Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele, as well as the school of thought of Freud and Schnitzler. Reinvigorating the intellectual enquiry that began in Vienna 1900,\u00a0<i>The Age of Insight<\/i>\u00a0is a wonderfully written, superbly researched, and beautifully illustrated book that also provides a foundation for future work in neuroscience and the humanities. It is an extraordinary book from an international leader in neuroscience and intellectual history.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"2 blocks south of Union Square.  47 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10003","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Art-Book-Club\/events\/223336751\/","yes_rsvp_count":22,"name":"The Age of Insight: Vienna 1900 to the Present","id":"223336751","time":1442075400000,"updated":1442094529000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346205854000,"name":"Manhattan Art Book Club","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":4670762,"urlname":"Manhattan-Art-Book-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441813291000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiopepenyc.com\/menus\/brunch\/\">Tio Pepe<\/a><\/b> <b>offers authentic Spanish and Mexican Cuisine.\u00a0 Since 1970, Tio Pepe has kept a finger on the pulse of Spain and Mexico\u2019s latest fine dining trends.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiopepenyc.com\/menus\/brunch\/\">Instead of a fusion concept,<\/a> the chefs at Tio Pepe prefer to perfect the intricacies of Spanish and Mexican fare and offer them side by side.

They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band\u2019s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We'll be meeting at the Skylight Diner to discuss the book and pick our next selection.
