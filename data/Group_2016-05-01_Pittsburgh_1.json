Once a month our Local Ambassadors host a Saturday morning meet-up in cities all around the world to discuss prayer, and connect with women in their local communities for fellowship, food, and fun on the strength of our faith. <br>It is the mission of Girlfriends Pray Ministries to get more women closer to God through prayer; and our vision is to get 1 million women around the world united in prayer. Although we are a non-traditional unconventional ministry with 80% of our service to women delivered virtually, in 2015 we expanded our service to women nationally and internationally off-line with our LIVE Breakfast Book Club (BBC) prayer groups. <br><\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to also partner with us as day after day we connect with women all around the global and come face-to-face with real life issues, challenges and the needs of women. So many women depend on Girlfriends Pray Ministries as a life line to God.

I have been teaching preparedness since 1990's. A lot of it in Michigan and Virginia. I'm now here in greater Pittsburgh PA and I have found ZERO REAL Preparedness Groups. Some great ONLINE ones, but I want one like my buddies have in Texas. A group that meets each month. Teaches something each month. Organizes Trips and Classes. Classes on REAL Tactical Weapons (Pistol, Carbine, Shotgun). NOT just an \"NRA Level 1A class\" but a tactical class that will have you shooting 400-600 rounds per day. When someone in the group is going to butcher rabbits or get in a shipment of Chicks or Ducklings I want them to feel welcome and open enough to invite over those from the group that want to learn. For those who run a big garden, want a bunch of help planting? I want those in the group that want to learn planting to be able to come over and help you plant. I want it to be a community from the community. Come to the 1st Meeting, probably at the Pine Twp Community Center on April 28th 2016 7pm - 9pm. We ONLY have room for 50 people. If you are coming, you MUST sign up for the meeting at http:\/\/bit.ly\/PittPrepGroup PLEASE share this on facebook and spread the work to your friends.
