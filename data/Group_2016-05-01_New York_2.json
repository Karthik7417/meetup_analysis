Having a tough time getting enough of your friends to go paintballing? Then join us! This group is meant for those who enjoy being outdoors, making new friends, playing paintball, and above all having fun. We accept players of all experience levels, so as long as you're interested, we would be thrilled to have you join our events! As a heads up, most of our players are average, casual or new players.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Our goal is to also create a community of organizers as well so we can have a consistent number of group events throughout the year without having to put the burden of organizing on the shoulders of the same few people every time. There will be times where us organizers will just want to play at events than rather organize one; in those instances other organizers can step up to the plate and carry the torch. So if you're interested in organizing an event feel free to contact any of the co-organizers of this group.<br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">This group is open to new and experienced players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : medium\">Girls and Guys, 18 or older.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Younger players must be accompanied by a legal guardian.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size : medium\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size : small\"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREPARATION &amp; WHAT YOU SHOULD WEAR:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>* Bring a beat-up pair of boots or high-top sneakers. We will be walking\/hiking through the woods for most of the day.<\/p>\n<p>* Wear 2-3 layers of shirts for extra protection and a thick pair of leggings, sweats, dickie coveralls etc. I've seen people wear snowboarding pants or hockey shorts (on top of their pants) for extra protection.&nbsp; I will likely have a t-shirt, long sleeve thermal plus another long sleeve military camo shirt and pants. If not you can always rent coveralls from skirmish for about $8 and wear it on top of your clothes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* Bring a hoodie or skullie (or both) for extra protection of your head. The rental masks provided only provide coverage of your face from slightly below your chin to slightly above your forehead.<\/p>\n<p>* Bring thin gloves (baseball batting gloves are perfect) to protect your hands &amp; knuckles.<\/p>\n<p>* Bring extra money for food, upgrades and accessories. Beyond the minimum $100 you will spend on admission, bus and paintballs, as a new player, you may want to look into upgrading your gun for an additional $20 or buying gloves, neck protector or coveralls. You can also visit your local paintball shops if you wish to buy &amp; learn about this stuff before arriving to Skirmish. You can also visit Skirmish.com or call them for pricing on these items.<\/p>\n<p>* As a recommendation to the new players who are willing to make some extra investments for this trip; I would invest in a full head paintball mask which can range from $30-$50, gloves (paintball &amp; baseball batting gloves practically the same thing) and a neck protector. It's Worth the investment in my opinion if you see yourself paintballing again in the future.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/highres_28449181.jpeg","photo_id":28449181,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/600_28449181.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/d\/d\/thumb_28449181.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":32934562,"name":"Jabari Osaze","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/c\/8\/highres_80685512.jpeg","photo_id":80685512,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/c\/8\/member_80685512.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/1\/c\/8\/thumb_80685512.jpeg"}},"members":773,"name":"NY\/NJ Paintball Meetup","id":1524144,"state":"NJ","urlname":"nypaintball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.8300018311,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Ramsey","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1253047281000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"rawfood","name":"Raw Food","id":1983},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"living-foods","name":"Living Foods","id":17440},{"urlkey":"childrens-health-and-nutrition","name":"Children's Health and Nutrition","id":26929},{"urlkey":"raw-potlucks","name":"Raw Potlucks","id":28231},{"urlkey":"raw-food-preparation","name":"Raw Food Preparation","id":29659},{"urlkey":"vegan-potlucks-and-dineouts","name":"Vegan Potlucks and Dineouts","id":74670}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Raw-Food-Support\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>The New Jersey Raw Food Support Network was started to provide health and nutrition information for the raw food lifestyle in New Jersey.

Current membership is approximately 260-270. Joining this group and joining the club are not the same thing. CJSC is a non-profit club. We do enjoy sharing the passion for skiing and snowboarders with others who share this interest.

The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.\"\n  <br \/> - John Muir<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<br \/>We are a group of hiking friends who enjoy exploring the mountains. We hike and backpack the many beautiful trails in the Northeast - the Harriman, Hudson, Kittanies, Gunks, Taconics, Catskills, Adirondacks and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>We also have the passion for photography. We love taking pictures and sharing our experiences through our photos as much as we enjoy hiking the high peaks.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is primarily open to our network of hiking friends and acquaintances. One can initially join as guest of, and\/or by invitation from regular members. Guest members will become full members once they have done two major day hikes with us and have shown great interest with the group, or will be taken out if inactive after a certain period.<\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that our major hikes are moderate to strenuous, with a rise of 1,000ft or more, and a total distance of at least 6miles. You must have good hiking experience or are working to promote your skills so you can enjoy our hikes and get rewarded with those amazing sights.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that a more connected membership generates more goodwill and fun for all. And we would like to grow that way. We will limit the group size to promote group cohesiveness. Our core team will set the guidelines for the best way to move the group forward.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you are fun, friendly and have set yourself goals to explore the mountains, then you are in. Put on your hiking shoes, grab your camera, and join us as we discover nature's beauty around us and at the high peaks!<\/p>\n<p>Read more about us&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NortheastHighPeaks\/about\/\"><\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NortheastHighPeaks\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NortheastHighPeaks\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NortheastHighPeaks\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NortheastHighPeaks\/about\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.8600006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/4\/8\/highres_172890792.jpeg","photo_id":172890792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/4\/8\/600_172890792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/4\/8\/thumb_172890792.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":7704079,"name":"Rollo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/c\/6\/highres_87556582.jpeg","photo_id":87556582,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/c\/6\/member_87556582.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/c\/6\/thumb_87556582.jpeg"}},"members":345,"name":"Northeast High Peaks & Photography","id":1532311,"state":"NY","urlname":"NortheastHighPeaks","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":41.0800018311,"who":"Hiking Fellows"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1254312147000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"psychics","name":"Psychics","id":1523},{"urlkey":"reladvice","name":"Relationship Advice","id":3301},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"holistic-health","name":"Holistic Health","id":15478},{"urlkey":"mediumship","name":"Mediumship","id":16603},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"mental-focus","name":"Mental Focus","id":33779},{"urlkey":"employee-development","name":"Employee Development","id":35858},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"stress-management","name":"Stress Management","id":38897},{"urlkey":"hypnosis-for-inner-growth-healing","name":"Hypnosis for Inner Growth & Healing","id":50775}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Psychic-Reader-of-Grinds\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>As a young teenager I discovered a hidden talent to read the future through the ancient practice of reading the grounds of Turkish coffee.

Physicians. If you want to network, have fun or relax this is the group for you. Doctors who would like to meet for brunch, lunch and dinner should contact each other. \r\n\r\nMembership\r\n\r\nYou must post a picture of yourself and answer the questions to be approved. If you have a website or office information please feel free to include it in your profile. The questions aid in allowing people to get to know you better. You might live in the same neighborhood, work in similar fields or share alumni associations. Those with children can arrange play dates. \r\n\r\nAnswering the questions also helps to protect us from people joining who aren't physicians or who want to spam the group with information about their business\/ products.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRSVP\r\n\r\nIf you invite your friends who are physicians please add them in your rsvp.  Some venues are smaller and more intimate than others.  If an event is posted for a health fair with free dinner and an open bar if 10 of us rsvp then only the 10 of us should appear that day.  Please keep that in mind and be considerate. \r\n\r\nIf you rsvp yes and can no longer attend an event please change your rsvp to no.  We are busy and when an emergency arises I do not expect anyone to log on to meetup and change an rsvp to no before handling the situation.  However, I always ask for a contact number if you rsvp yes and I call everyone before an event to ensure they are coming.   \r\n\r\nPlease do not rsvp yes without a contact number.  Any yes rsvp without a contact number will not be honored. \r\n\r\nIf there is an event you will not be able to attend please rsvp no.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement \r\n\r\nI want everyone to feel free to participate and add anything they find to the group.

We are a ski club run for members by members. Our club motto is \"Think Snow\" - we do all the time! But just because we don't get snow year round doesn't mean we stop. Our foundation is built around snow-sports and the winter, but our club is active all year round. On season we run plenty of weekend trips to resorts in the Northeast and several week long trips out West or to Europe. Off season we don't stop- hiking, biking, happy hours, beach meet-ups and socializing are just a few of our activities. Our members are active men and women who live in the NJ\/NY area. The majority of our members are in their 20's &amp; 30's. (While we have no age limits, you do have to be 21 to join.) Whether you're a skier, snowboarder, or just like social activities, our club has something for you. Unlike some other ski clubs where you must attend every meeting, volunteer for duties, be voted in by nomination, etc...We do none of that. We realize everyone has their own lives and a busy schedule. Come to our meetings as often as you like, or as little as your schedule permits. Our $35 membership give you access to all activities year round and a great group of people.

So I decide to create one.<\/p>\n<p>This group is aimed to provide a platform to create active sports events for active fit Asian Americans, mostly FREE or at a bargain group rate price. This group is for young Asian professionals to enjoy active, and adventurous activties in group setting and make friends in the process. The group has age range from 20s to 30s to keep this group active and strong. Exceptions will be given to those who can demonstrate some extraordinary athletic abilities.<\/p>\n<p>The main activies include:<br>\n\n adventures, outdoor and sport\ufffdactivities, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, alpine skiing, downhill skiing, figure skating, ice dancing, roller-blading\/skating, badminton, table tennis (ping pong), archery, tennis, volleyball, swimming, biking, hiking, zip-Line, adventure courses, paintball, kayaking, bowling, fitness, gym, golf, fencing, whitewater rafting, camping, rock-climbing, sports and recreation, and more ...<\/p>\n<p>Some more adventurous events to try:<br>\n\n sky-diving, scuba-diving, wave surfing, wind surfing, paragliding, parasailing, horse-back riding & etc. (will update this) ...<\/p>\n<p>We will try to complement these events with breakfasts\/lunches\/dinners when possible. Hey, we all need energy to be active, right?<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we can join some laid back events like museums, movies, concerts, clubings, karaoke, travels, and Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese), Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese and other Asians culture events etc so we can enjoy other aspects of life too.<\/p>\n<p>So, all active Asian Americans, let's keep an active and healthy life style. Join this group and let's create fun active sporting events, and enjoy the life to its fullness together!!!<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

We bring together filmmakers, producers, directors, actors, writers, cameramen, and editors to share their experience, polish their skills, and help each other through networking events, seminars and workshops.   Filmmaking is a collaborative process, and we are here to foster and nurture that collaboration. With so many filmmakers and actors in NYC who work from big budget movies to student films, this group aims to give you an edge in the congested world of New York filmmaking.  Through a series of events, we&rsquo;ll cover every part of the filmmaking process; some with guest speakers, others in production facilities, but all aiming to bring our professional experience and knowledge to our members, and build a network of talented filmmakers and performers.

The Lectorium Rosicrucianum, or International School of the Golden Rosycross, aims to help seekers find and form a living connection with this shining filament, which is woven of love, wisdom, knowledge (gnosis) and action. Most importantly, this golden thread is a Path that can actually be walked, a Path shown by all religions in their original form. No Master or Initiate can give the Truth to another. It can only be approached by our own efforts, and by persevering throughout all the obstructions and difficulties we encounter on the way. And it can only be reached through an inner process of transformation called 'soul-rebirth', or 'transfiguration'. A bonafide School points out the Path of transfiguration and teaches its pupils how to follow it. It is not the I-central self, or personality, that profits from the process of transfiguration as meant here, but the inner, divine Self, which is awakened and enababled to become increasingly active. This has tremendous results for the personality: he or she becomes an instrument, a servant, of another Order, the Divine Order, the 'kingdom not of this world', and in that state is able to stand right in the midst of the world in the service of every human being. The Lectorium Rosicrucianum is a modern organization in the sense that its message is adapted to the strongly individualized consciousness of twentieth and twenty-first century humanity. However, it has deep roots in the past, for it is part of the long and ancient tradition of Mystery Schools, and is a development of earlier impulses of spiritual awakening such as those of the gnostics, Albigenses, Cathars and classical Rosicrucians of the 17th century.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about us on our web site www.goldenrosycross.org, or if you download the brochure in the file section!<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/highres_435465619.jpeg","photo_id":435465619,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/600_435465619.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/3\/3\/thumb_435465619.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10885463,"name":"Marie-Rose Nduku"},"members":201,"name":"Lectorium Rosicrucianum - New York City","id":1557849,"state":"NY","urlname":"goldenrosycross-NYC","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1258483680000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"jazz","name":"Jazz","id":131},{"urlkey":"musicians","name":"Musicians","id":173},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"boston-artists","name":"Artists","id":16573},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"brooklyn","name":"Brooklyn","id":16794},{"urlkey":"contemporary-jazz-enthusiasts","name":"Contemporary Jazz Enthusiasts","id":19799}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Jazz\/","rating":3.94,"description":"<p>This group is for those who love to partake in live music, especially jazz, and in the Brooklyn area.

Organizers are charged a fee to maintain their meet-ups. So, after careful consideration, and talking to other gaming groups, here is what I've decided to do. $5.00 for the whole year (membership) OR $1 per event\/per person(guest).

At that time, Crowley met with various masons and met who would become the first priest of his Order, Don Jesus Medina.<br>\n\nThe concept was simple and beautiful, and marked the beginning of Crowley&rsquo;s personal development in this journey that culminated in what we know today as the &ldquo;Vision and the Voice&rdquo;. This journey ends with the spiritual stage of inner light: The Lamp.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light intent is to keep this Light available and ready for those who are in need of it by continuing with Crowley's concept in a new form. The Light never went out.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe Central Ritual incorporates techniques based on the Cube of Space (a cabalistic model for the Universe) and other Hermetic teachings. It is a participatory ritual and has a deep impact to open our inner self to the energies of the present Aeon.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light aligns itself with the principles of Thelema, the teachings in the Book of the Law and its message of Life, Light, Liberty and Love.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLove is the law, love under will<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/highres_25841401.jpeg","photo_id":25841401,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/600_25841401.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/b\/9\/thumb_25841401.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2301408,"name":"Juan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/a\/f\/highres_437071.jpeg","photo_id":437071,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/a\/f\/member_437071.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/2\/a\/f\/thumb_437071.jpeg"}},"members":213,"name":"The Congregation of the Lamp of Invisible Light","id":1561494,"state":"NY","urlname":"lampofinvisiblelight","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Thelemites"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1259102527000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newmedia","name":"New Media","id":1851},{"urlkey":"new-york","name":"New York","id":18312},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"augmented-reality","name":"Augmented Reality","id":26061}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ARNY-Augmented-Reality-New-York\/","rating":4.77,"description":"Augmented Reality (AR) will one day change the way we interact with the world. \r\n\r\nAR technology has come a long way and is now ready for the market.

This group is for young single professionals to enjoy active, and adventurous activties in group setting and make friends in the process.

Exceptions will be given to those who can demonstrate some extraordinary athletic abilities.<\/p>\n<p>The main activies include:<br>\n\n adventures, outdoor and sport activities, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, alpine skiing, downhill skiing, figure skating, ice dancing, roller-blading\/skating, badminton, table tennis (ping pong), archery, tennis, volleyball, swimming, biking, hiking, zip-Line, adventure courses, paintball, kayaking, bowling, fitness, gym, golf, fencing, whitewater rafting, camping, rock-climbing, sports and recreation, and more ...<\/p>\n<p>Some more adventurous events to try:<br>\n\n sky-diving, scuba-diving, wave surfing, wind surfing, paragliding, parasailing, horse-back riding &amp; etc. (will update this) ...<\/p>\n<p>We will try to complement these events with breakfasts\/lunches\/dinners when possible. Hey, we all need energy to be active, right?<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, we can join some laid back events like museums, movies, concerts, clubings, karaoke, and travels etc so we can enjoy other aspects of life too.<\/p>\n<p>So, all active singles, let's keep an active and healthy life style.

We play a competitive and physical form of Flag Football. However, we all do know that we aren't getting paid to play football&nbsp;and we're not in the NFL. The difference between us and other&nbsp;games is that we maintain a balance between both.&nbsp;Our games are fun and competitive,&nbsp; but&nbsp;we don't take the game too seriously like others.&nbsp;The important rule to follow here is sportsmanship. Just treat other players with respect and you'll be fine.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>This group is for people in NYC that like to play Football but don't want to pay the fees associated with joining a league. The first thing you should know about this game is that its FREE! There is no membership cost and the only fee I might collect is to update our equipment or help pay for this website fee. Its basically an old school weekly pick-up football game that's a lot more organized. Ages of members range from 25-40 yrs old. The Sat game is pretty much all guys.<\/p>\r\n<p>I've been organizing a regular flag football game in Queens for the past 4 years and we already have a solid group of regulars that play. However, I thought it was time for me to make a meetup group to make recruiting much easier for us.

Many of us are so over stimulated and stressed out that we cannot hear what our bodies are saying. We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us. Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs. Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process. Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life. Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you. Discover the passion and power that resides within you Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down. You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose. Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies. Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/highres_403753142.jpeg","photo_id":403753142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/600_403753142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/5\/6\/thumb_403753142.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7098834,"name":"Ben Oofana","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/4\/a\/highres_72341802.jpeg","photo_id":72341802,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/4\/a\/member_72341802.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/4\/a\/thumb_72341802.jpeg"}},"members":2323,"name":"Awaken the Healing Power Within Your Body  and Mind","id":1574661,"state":"NY","urlname":"awakenthehealingpower","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1262215749000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"ruby","name":"Ruby","id":1040},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"web-performance","name":"Web Performance","id":15091},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"tech-talks","name":"Tech Talks","id":91146}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Tech-Talks\/","rating":4.57,"description":"<p>The purpose of this Meetup Group is to gather local NYC area techies together to learn from one another.

We aim to honor Lilith in all Her aspects.<\/p>\n<p>We expect that most of our members will also belong to other spiritual groups that revere other deities.

I wanted to highlight the people and places that play the kind of music you have to dig deep for.\r\nEveryone has their own defintion of good music. \r\nHere is mine:\r\nSoulful\/afro house, afrobeat, Funk\/Soul(james brown to sharon jones), 50's RB\/rock, garage, punk(the screeching weasel,ramones),Raggae,Hip Hop(de la soul to anti pop consortium),salsa,boogaloo,flamenco, jazz and  blues.\r\n\r\nThere is so much  music out in the world, but  many  never  know because they listen to commercial radio or commercial dj's. They will only hear the same three songs and never be educated on the real expanse of music out that's out there . I am a huge fan of WFMU.org, 91.1 on the radio dial. They are a freeform listener supported radio station that plays different  kinds of music.

What caught my attention was an audience member who had read the book asked him to confirm the HP Lovecraft references in the book. (HP Lovecraft?!).

I am a trained psychic detective, medium, medical intuitive, paranormal investigator and energy healer.

I graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University and cum laude on Law Review from Pace University School of Law.  I love evidence!  I do not want to \"preach to the choir\" - I prefer to teach to those who are intrigued by this field but require some form of rational proof that it is real or who have doubts that they have any psychic abilities.  Skepticism is nothing more than another way of asking questions.  Curiosity and discipline are the only two prerequisites for these classes.  Once you join the New York City Skeptical Psychics Society Meetup Group, you will be sent the information about the times and location for the workshops held in Manhattan and other nearby locations.  Each workshop costs $30 and  you are not obligated to attend all workshops.

In addition, we welcome those with no experience to join us in our play readings to read or to listen.<\/p>\n<p>Members meet to read plays once a month. We&nbsp; select the next play reading from a list submitted by members. Roles are assigned at each reading. No acting experience necessary.&nbsp; Members may choose to listen and not read. Discussion, community and \"pot-luck\" refreshments are a part of each reading.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we present stage readings and full productions. This group produced its first work, <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,<\/em> at our studio in Park Slope in 2010. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our first presentation in Manhattan was a staged reading of Sam Shepard's&nbsp; <em>Curse of the Starving Class,<\/em> at the Barrow Group Studio Theater on May 15, 2011. We then produced an Equity showcase production of this same work in September of 2011 for 12 performances at the Bridge Theater in Manhattan with 5 Equity and 4 non-Equity actors.<\/p>\n<p>We have produced several fully staged readings at the Leroy Street Library including <i>Henry IV, part I, King Lear and The Three Sisters. <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p>Our second Equity showcase production was an original work, <i>The Portrait, <\/i>by one of our members, Sarah Levin Simon and directed by another member, Roger Simon. The cast featured several of our members, including yours truly. <br><\/p>\n<p>The group also encourages playwrights to submit new scripts for reading by members. An invited audience is welcome to provide feedback for playwrights.<\/p>\n<p>We are also associated with the New York Shakespeare Reading Group and list our Shakespearean readings on that site as well as this site. We read something from Shakespeare at least once every two&nbsp; or three months.<\/p>\n<p>There are not fees or charges for this group.

This group was started as a place to find other people who want to learn about wine and food in a casual, fun, and stimulating setting.&nbsp; This is not a dating or pick-up group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We meet at least once per month at a local venue that allows us to bring our own&nbsp;wine. There are so many great places in NYC that are BYO\/BYOB we can enjoy wine and food in a casual, fun, interesting, affordable atmosphere. We&nbsp; have access&nbsp;to great wine and we are always looking to enjoy it with like minded people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The group was founded by Vicente Pina, a wine educator, wine writer, and former retailer. He created a group that was relaxed and focused on enjoying wine without being pompous or intimidating.&nbsp; When Vince left for a job opportunity in the Northwest, the members wanted to continue the group, so Dan Goroff and Jeff M, two amateur wine lovers, have taken over as organizers with support from other members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Our aim is to promote the love of wine by providing other wine lovers the chance to learn about the wonderful world of wine and sample world-class vino as we socialize and meet a diverse group of people with similar interests. Our primary emphasis is to have fun by fusing these three activities - enjoying wine, food and meeting interesting people. The venues of our meetings will generally be BYO\/BYOB places whenever possible, that also offer to great food and ambiance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We taste wines from all over the world that have been rated by The Wine Advocate, International Wine Cellars, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast magazines, James Halliday, Jancis Robinson, and other renowned experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Everyone is welcome! From new people to wine, to long time wine lovers. So lets join up and have fun meeting and mingling while indulging in three of life's most satisfying pleasures - PEOPLE, WINE &amp; FOOD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One final key point, the purpose of our events is for you, our members, to enjoy wine, food and friendship in a relaxed environment.&nbsp; It is even more important that you get home safely from the event. One of the nice things about organizing wine tastings in New York is that all of our events are convenient to subway or bus lines.&nbsp; <b>After sharing six or seven bottles of wine between ten people, people should not be driving.&nbsp; You can use mass transit, cabs or Uber to get home, but please do not endanger yourself or others by driving after one of our events.&nbsp; We have zero tolerance for this behavior and members will be removed from the group if we find that they are driving after our events.<\/b><\/p> CHEERS!!!","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/5\/6\/highres_432084918.jpeg","photo_id":432084918,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/5\/6\/600_432084918.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/1\/5\/6\/thumb_432084918.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":17494981,"name":"Jeff M","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/6\/2\/highres_204865442.jpeg","photo_id":204865442,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/6\/2\/member_204865442.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/3\/6\/2\/thumb_204865442.jpeg"}},"members":1241,"name":"NYC Wine Tasting Group","id":1621920,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Wine-Tasting-Group","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Members or Wine-os"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Paramus","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1269836096000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"linux","name":"Linux","id":188},{"urlkey":"mac","name":"Mac","id":204},{"urlkey":"php","name":"PHP","id":455},{"urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source","id":563},{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"perl","name":"Perl","id":835},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"comptutor","name":"Computer Tutoring","id":10215},{"urlkey":"technology","name":"Technology","id":10579},{"urlkey":"apple","name":"Apple","id":17279},{"urlkey":"servers","name":"Servers","id":21717},{"urlkey":"sql","name":"SQL","id":33167},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"macintosh-computer-users","name":"Macintosh Computer Users","id":80614},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJLinux\/","rating":4.87,"description":"<p><span><strong><span>New Jersey Linux User Group<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We hold our monthly group meeting the last Tuesday of every month. <br> We also have some other member meetings at different times. <br> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Come one, come all.. <span>... not just<\/span> Linux users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>this MeetUp group is part of an established <strong><span>25+<\/span><\/strong> year group<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>the attendee numbers shown each meeting may show less than actual attendees<\/span> <br> <\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.0699996948,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/4\/highres_446055428.jpeg","photo_id":446055428,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/4\/600_446055428.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/4\/thumb_446055428.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11192463,"name":"Nickalf.....","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/7\/4\/highres_9279796.jpeg","photo_id":9279796,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/7\/4\/member_9279796.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/b\/7\/4\/thumb_9279796.jpeg"}},"members":360,"name":"New Jersey Linux User Group","id":1622036,"state":"NJ","urlname":"NJLinux","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.9500007629,"who":"LUGers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1269882419000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"womensports","name":"Women's Sports","id":6828},{"urlkey":"nutrition","name":"Nutrition","id":10161},{"urlkey":"womens-fitness","name":"Women's Fitness","id":15123},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"all-female-kick-boxing-boot-camp","name":"All Female Kick Boxing Boot Camp","id":37989}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FitnessBoxing\/","rating":4.74,"description":"Fitness boxing has quickly become one of the best cardio workouts.

Please come out and see what it is all about. <br><\/p>\n<p>If you're interested in this group, I've pasted further details below. <br><\/p>\n<p>******************************************************** <br><\/p>\n<p>This is not just a process group for women in the New York City area to work through the challenges presented by genital herpes infection, it is also a space for women affected by herpes to get their mind off of the infection and connect with other women on the everyday issues that we all deal with - dating, relationships, dreams about the future, health, and career.<\/p>\n<p>The group is facilitated by me. I am a New York State Licensed Mental Health Counselor. Prior to becoming a psychotherapist, I was a Certified Health Coach. I have over 10 years of experience leading women's groups and coaching women who are looking for support in achieving personal goals, improving self-esteem and body image, and increasing opportunities for more satisfying relationships (dating\/family\/friendships). In addition, I have a special focus on working with women who have genital herpes. I know how difficult it is to find accurate information and good doctors, as well as the challenge to rebuild your self-esteem after a diagnosis. I am passionate about seeing women overcome these challenges, and the many women I have worked with over the years have discovered confidence again and have entered into great relationships.<\/p>\n<p>In this group, we will sort through the facts about herpes and you will have an opportunity to get updated and accurate information about herpes. We will discuss body image, relationships, social stigmas and how all of these things uniquely affect you.<\/p>\n<p>But we don't stop there. Genital herpes is only one part of your life. I have been hosting women's groups for a number of years and all women deal with challenges to their self-esteem, frustrations and disappointments in the dating world, questions about their career path, and joy in their achievements. This group will offer a structured environment with weekly topics that will provide you an opportunity to discuss these issues, process and solve the problems related, and find inspiration and motivation to move forward. Most importantly, you will be able to connect and share with other women in a safe space where you can also discuss your concerns about genital herpes.<\/p>\n<p>If you have genital herpes, or your partner has genital herpes, please inquire for information about being a part of the group. The group meets on the 2nd &amp; 4th Sunday each month. The group is $150 every 2 months. There will be no charge for the first meeting. Please come out and see what it is all about. This group is a positive, progress oriented group.<\/p>\n<p><b>More about me:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>For more information about me, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myheartdances.com\">http:\/\/www.myheartdances.com<\/a> and my blog at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myheartdances.blogspot.com\">http:\/\/www.myheartdances.blogspot.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To have a better understanding of how I became involved in working with women with genital herpes, please visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myheartdances.com\/p\/services.html\">http:\/\/www.myheartdances.com\/p\/services.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>and my story: <a href=\"http:\/\/myheartdances.blogspot.com\/p\/my-story.html\">http:\/\/myheartdances.blogspot.com\/p\/my-story.html<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/f\/3\/highres_14091955.jpeg","photo_id":14091955,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/f\/3\/600_14091955.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/a\/f\/3\/thumb_14091955.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":7217652,"name":"Melissa","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/8\/d\/highres_9286989.jpeg","photo_id":9286989,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/8\/d\/member_9286989.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/7\/8\/d\/thumb_9286989.jpeg"}},"members":79,"name":"Genital Herpes is Not My Identity","id":1624707,"state":"NY","urlname":"Genital-Herpes-is-Not-My-Identity","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1270431225000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"soccer","name":"Soccer","id":947},{"urlkey":"pickupsoccer","name":"Pick-Up Soccer","id":3340},{"urlkey":"indoor-soccer","name":"Indoor Soccer","id":15826},{"urlkey":"coed-soccer","name":"Coed Soccer","id":20557},{"urlkey":"outdoor-soccer","name":"Outdoor Soccer","id":24517},{"urlkey":"nyc-soccer","name":"NYC Soccer","id":25732}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/PlaySoccer2Give\/","rating":4.72,"description":"<p>PS2G is a Local Game for Global Change based in NYC.

I learned so much, and most of all, come out full of confidence on my ability to do this and be a mom. - Gaelle<\/p>\n<p> <br> Renee - Many thanks to you for organizing, hosting, and structuring. It's been great, relaxing, entertaining, fun, and insightful - Anneloes<\/p>\n<p> <br> Hi Renee - Wanted to thank you again for all the guidance, perspective and support. They have been a really powerful tool in managing the introduction to parenthood! I'd have a lot more stress, second guessing, and fewer smiles if I had not attended. Hope to see you soon! Thanks, Suzi<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Becoming a new mom was the most exhilarating, exhausting, and intense journey I'd ever experienced. What I found I needed most was a sense of community, which is what this group offers. Meeting up, learning from, and laughing with others helps turn an uncertain and potentially scary time into a shared adventure. Renee makes everyone comfortable, and is a reassuring and knowledgeable guide for new moms! - Ellie, mom to Ben <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/7\/2\/highres_14243410.jpeg","photo_id":14243410,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/7\/2\/600_14243410.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/7\/2\/thumb_14243410.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":269551,"name":"Renee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/5\/e\/highres_200531102.jpeg","photo_id":200531102,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/5\/e\/member_200531102.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/b\/5\/e\/thumb_200531102.jpeg"}},"members":1957,"name":"New Moms Support Group NYC","id":1627967,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-Moms-Support-Group-NYC","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Fellow Moms"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1270999728000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"scrabble","name":"Scrabble","id":256},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"queer-socializing","name":"Queer Socializing","id":51392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Lesbian-Scrabble\/","rating":4.33,"description":"<p>This group gets together to socialize and meet with other queer women while playing a casual game of scrabble.

this group is to meet other people suffering from bipolar disorder. To discuss symptoms (and how they effect our jobs, activities and relationships), moods, medications, natural solutions, and treatments in a group that attempts to be as neutral and positive as possible. And maybe even make some new bipolar friends. <br> <br> I started this group because I was dissatisfied with other groups I had joined in the past. Certain discussions at such group(s) seemed to veer off into inappropriate debates of an offensive socio-political nature, including unnecessarily bringing up inflammatory topics, cultural\/ethnic\/religious\/societal issues, political affiliations, etc. Many seemed set up to be a personal social club for the organizer, with an atmosphere that favored a core group of people who had been in the group longest. <br> <br> I am not a psychologist\/psychiatrist or an expert (although I do read articles on the topic whenever I can), but I do promise to bring my most supportive and neutral self to the group. I would expect others to do the same, particularly due to the vulnerable and sensitive nature of the group and disorder. <br> <br> On a side note, I do not believe in censorship, and I am all for people having informal conversations (about love, relationships, jobs, art, etc), but I would encourage people to stay away from divisive ones like politics, ethnic, religious and cultural debates. Bipolar people cannot afford to have their day (and mood) ruined by people attempting to exploit the group to further their own personal agendas, demean certain \u201cgroups\u201d of people, or use the group as a debate club or an extension of a political party. Those conversations are, by their very nature, animosity provoking in others, emotionally intense and upsetting (especially for bipolar people), and therefore counter-productive to the purpose of the group, which is to be a healing and supportive force in people's lives. <br> <br> If you want to meet with a group that does it's best to maintain an environment of neutrality and support and STAYS ON TOPIC by not encouraging divisive political or cultural conversations, join this!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/highres_14413113.jpeg","photo_id":14413113,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/600_14413113.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/3\/3\/9\/thumb_14413113.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4012066,"name":"Elisabeth","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/8\/9\/a\/highres_9606298.jpeg","photo_id":9606298,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/8\/9\/a\/member_9606298.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/8\/9\/a\/thumb_9606298.jpeg"}},"members":290,"name":"The Apolitical Bipolar Meetup Group","id":1631842,"state":"NY","urlname":"The-Other-apolitical-NYC-Bipolar-Meetup-Group","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1271532198000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"reiki","name":"Reiki","id":1204},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"lawofattraction","name":"Law of Attraction","id":3382},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"lifetransform","name":"Life Transformation","id":8702},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","id":15738},{"urlkey":"alternative-medicine","name":"Alternative Medicine","id":17150},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyspirit\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p>Meet other locals to discuss your path.

In some ways it is similar to card games like rummy or poker, but it is played with a set of tiles instead of a deck of cards. This game is very popular in Japan, and is rapidly gaining popularity in the United States. Envision a game with its roots in gambling, played by the Yakuza... but with a strong skill component that makes it suitable for competitive play too. Riichi Mahjong retains the excitement of a gambling-style game, but also emphasizes strategy. It is a game with a lot of depth and richness, but most of all, it's REALLY FUN!<\/p>\n<p><em>More about the USPML<\/em><br>\n\n The USPML is a new organization for Riichi mahjong players in America.

I come armed with numerous thorough, expensive and informative Psychiatric textbooks, a few Clinical Psychology Textbooks, as well as numerous excellent books on Bipolar Disorder, which you will have full access to once you join the group. The books alone are worth thousands of dollars. Then I also add to the mix professional, peer-reviewed papers found on PubMed or PsychINFO that address salient issues that those with Bipolar Disorder must face.<\/p>\n<p>I ask for a $40 initiation fee from each member not to cover the costs of the thousands of dollars of excellent written resources that you'd otherwise be without. Rather, I ask for a one-time $40 fee to show your support of my emails reviewing literature that are very easy to read when some of these original documents\/textbooks are not written for the general public. In my emails, I also share my personal struggles\/insights that come from having Bipolar Disorder myself. You also get stellar email responses from other members who share your passion for knowing as much as possible about what may help us get better while weeding out the junk information that is not credible.<\/p>\n<p>A little more about me. I don't mean to boast, but I feel I must if I am to ask for your money to hear from me. I was a medical student at New York Medical College in Westchester when I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type I. After my diagnosis, I found medical school to be much more of a struggle, especially during my third year when I was suicidally depressed while having to work extremely hard on the wards, only to go home to more studying in a perpetual state of sleep deprivation. Anyone with Bipolar Disorder knows that extreme sleep deprivation and highly stressful environments can make it incredibly hard to thrive with our disease. I'm skipping over a little bit of the story here, but basically I decided to pursue a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology instead of pursuing a residency in Psychiatry because 1. I would learn psychotherapy much better this way and 2. I would not have to subject myself to a lifestyle that is incompatible with my illness. While there's a bit more to the story, what I shared is a pretty good summary of what happened.<\/p>\n<p>I have a few test scores that I wish to share because I think it helps me justify asking for an initiation fee, while I don't like boasting. On the Psychiatry shelf exam (the test all third year medical students take to assess how well they understand\/can properly treat Psychiatric illness, I scored 2 standard deviations above the national mean. That means 98% of the nation's med students scored below me on this assessment of our mastery of Psychiatry. Then in order to apply to the field of Clinical Psychology, I took the GRE Psychology subject test and got a 790 with 98% scoring below me again. The point is I humbly consider myself on the road to becoming a true expert on Bipolar Disorder and Clinical Psychology\/Psychiatry in general. This means I can answer a lot of your questions, and I'm a very good researcher so I can almost always look up the answer when I don't know it.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, the $40 buys you the ability to ask me to provide a detailed summary of whatever topic you are interested in, so long as it pertains to Bipolar Disorder or Psychiatry more generally. Since I work for you, I ask for a one-time fee for compensation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here are the topics that I review on a regular basis:<\/p>\n<p>*The importance of sleep in Bipolar Disorder, including how we can best get ourselves sleeping well<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the things that those with Bipolar Disorder do who thrive that is different from the rest of us. This includes understanding the importance of trying to spot depression or mania as early on as possible, and then act in such a way as to prevent a pathological state from occurring. I believe everyone with Bipolar Disorder who wishes to thrive must play a very active role in self-monitoring and prevention of disease states.<\/p>\n<p>*Reevaluating the nature of hypomania and mania, and how it's different from genuine well-being. I share why I believe living without hypomania (or mania) is ideal for me. I challenge those who are drawn to reexperiencing hypomania or mania to consider the wisdom and how much more rewarding living a symptomless life can be.<\/p>\n<p>*How to thrive with Bipolar Disorder at work and school, and the importance of becoming aware of the cognitive deficits that are common to Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Everything you didn't know about why lithium and other mood stabilizers are good for the Bipolar brain and how lithium is the best drug for preventing suicide in individuals with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Suicide, especially focusing on elucidating how big a problem is it and what can we do to get out of a suicidal situation.<\/p>\n<p>*Understanding how we differ from a \"normal\" person, even when we are in our \"normal\" state (aka when we're euthymic).<\/p>\n<p>*The importance of getting regular blood work to prevent organ damage that might otherwise result in extensive damage as this type of organ damage largely occurs silently.<\/p>\n<p>*Thorough review of all medication related to Bipolar Disorder, including efficacy and common side effects. In particular, I focus on antipsychotics, and how best to balance desired effect with the potential for horrible side effects.<\/p>\n<p>*Understanding Bipolar Depression, which is different from Unipolar Depression and generally harder to treat. On average someone with Bipolar Disorder will spend 3x more time in a state of depression than mania.<\/p>\n<p>*The power of Positive Psychology to help with all things Bipolar, most especially when one suffers from depression.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the major forms of psychotherapies being used for Bipolar Disorder, including efficacy and when they're indicated.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of how Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT) may be a critical component in the treatment of many individuals with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>*Quirky facts about Bipolar Disorder like how on average people with Bipolar Disorder are smarter than the general population, noteworthy characters in history\/the media who have Bipolar Disorder, the truth behind the mad genius stereotype, and when are we most creative.<\/p>\n<p>*A review of the neuroscience associated with Bipolar Disorder.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I could keep listing topics, but I've probably already overwhelmed the reader with my list. Any member can email me asking for a synopsis on any of these topics or any other topic that you believe is important, and I will respond with an informative and easily readable summary of the salient points. If I drop the ball and do not produce such a response within 3 weeks of your request, then I will grant you a full refund of your initiation fee.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This meetup is currently too small for regular in person meetups, but it is constantly growing so I'm confident in the not-so-distant future we will do in person meetups regularly. That was the primary aim of my meetup when I brought it into inception. In the meantime, if it's in person meetups that you're primarily after, I refer you to the numerous other excellent Bipolar Disorder support groups offered on meetup that are based in NYC. That said, we will do occasional meetups, and, again, I promise in the not-so-distant future we will start doing in person meetups frequently.<\/p>\n<p>I think I finally stopped talking. Thank you for reading this far if you did.

As a Breakups and Divorce Coach dedicated to support and empowerment during difficult times, each meetup will be facilitated and feature a theme that is specific to breakups, divorce and renewal. They may be related to emotions, healing, practical concerns, communication, relationships or dating again. We'll have a presentation, discussion, group sharing, and an exercise or techniques that will help us apply the concepts directly to our lives.

The entry price alone is around $35 to $40, and then you have the drinks and transportation... This would all be fine if you felt pretty sure you were going to meet your one-and-only that night, but often you simply need to go a few times to come across the person that's right for you.<\/p>\n<p>Don't get us wrong - we're huge fans of speed-dating. We think it way better than online dating, as you can not beat a quick face-to-face encounter to establish if the chemistry is right. We'd just like to make it a little cheaper, especially in times when we're all being conscious about what we spend our money on. And remember, the product is actually you, and the other 30 fabulous NYC singles attending - why should we pay $50 for that.<\/p>\n<p>Our aim is simple - we want to inform our members of cheap or free spots at speed-dating events, and\/or ensure that you're enjoying a free or inexpensive drink or appetizers while you there.<\/p>\n<p>This is not as hard as you might think. Unlike other singles events, speed-dating companies must almost exactly balance the number of men and women attending. It's not uncommon(for example) for a speed-dating company to be short eight women aged 28-37 the night before the event. They contact us, we shoot for free or maximum $25 spots, and everyone is happy.<\/p>\n<p>Now, here's the catch. We need you to play your part - in other words, if you rsvp to say you want to come, then you do need to show up. And at the event, as many of the participants will have paid full price, then to avoid any grumpiness, we would ask that you don't share your discounted or free rate.<\/p>\n<p>So if you're someone who is single and looking to date, is budget conscious, and can be a little flexible and spontaneous when offers come your way, then this Meetup group is for you! And there is no downside to joining - we'll simply inform you of free or cheap spots, and if you want to come, you rsvp. We will then contact you to let you know if you have a spot (i.e., you don't have a spot just by RSVPing here, you have a spot once you register with a free or discount code on the speed-dating site).<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to helping you get dates!<\/p>\n<p>Jen<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/highres_277681972.jpeg","photo_id":277681972,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/600_277681972.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/4\/thumb_277681972.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4064503,"name":"Daniel","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/2\/2\/highres_143778722.jpeg","photo_id":143778722,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/2\/2\/member_143778722.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/9\/2\/2\/thumb_143778722.jpeg"}},"members":1305,"name":"New York Discounted Speeddating Group","id":1673341,"state":"NY","urlname":"nyc-discounted-speeddating","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1278861643000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"art","name":"Art","id":1502},{"urlkey":"creativecircle","name":"Creative Circle","id":10447},{"urlkey":"arts","name":"Arts & Entertainment","id":10574},{"urlkey":"painting","name":"Painting","id":16784},{"urlkey":"landscape-painting","name":"Landscape Painting","id":18373},{"urlkey":"self-expression","name":"Self Expression","id":19588},{"urlkey":"acrylic-painting-classes","name":"Acrylic Painting classes","id":19850},{"urlkey":"oil-painting","name":"Oil Painting","id":22825},{"urlkey":"painting-oil-acrylic-watercolor-etc","name":"Painting - Oil, Acrylic, Watercolor, etc.","id":25223},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"watercolor-painting","name":"Watercolor Painting","id":53124}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Outdoor-Plein-Air-Painting-classes-in-New-York\/","rating":4.98,"description":"<p><span style=\"color : #333399\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #0000ff\">This group is for you if you would like a\u00a0great group of people to paint with as well as\u00a0an experienced,\u00a0professional painter alongside you to show you the ropes and help develop your own creativity. <em>Don't go it alone; have someone there to help bring out the best in your paintings!<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">So you would like to try painting and\u00a0you don't have an easel or paints?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">No<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> <span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">problem, just choose the day you can attend and everything needed will be brought along for you!<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #333399\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #333399\"><span style=\"color : #ff00ff\"><span style=\"font-size : small\"><span style=\"color : #33cccc\">Never painted before?

We will extend invitations to attend workshops and panels with industry professionals, insiders and influencers willing to share their knowledge and services in the world of social media and selling via the social web.

We will cover those as well as the growing areas of content and video marketing. Other helpful events will focus on digital advertising logistics, accounting and financial planning. <br> <br>We also schedule events like art shows and movie premiere passes because building a social network is not all about analytics, backlinks and seo.

We will not accept one to two-word answers on every question. Thanks!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Meetup is not an accurate measure of how many people are attending an event, nor of our gender ratio. We use many platforms to promote events \/ meetups, and many of our members do not use Meetup. While 12 people might RSVP here, the actual event might have upwards of 80 people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/youngnaturistsamerica.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/youngnaturistsamerica.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/8\/a\/highres_18558314.jpeg","photo_id":18558314,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/8\/a\/600_18558314.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/8\/a\/thumb_18558314.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12560461,"name":"Young Naturists America","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/2\/highres_171917202.jpeg","photo_id":171917202,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/2\/member_171917202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/3\/2\/thumb_171917202.jpeg"}},"members":1061,"name":"Young Naturists \/ Nudists America (YNA) meetup group","id":1677896,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Naturists-Nudist-meetup-group","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Nudies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1279626503000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"innovation","name":"Innovation","id":1954},{"urlkey":"productdesign","name":"Product Design","id":2993},{"urlkey":"inddesign","name":"Industrial Design","id":10249},{"urlkey":"3d-modeling","name":"3D Modeling","id":21429},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"3d-artists","name":"3D Artists","id":24147},{"urlkey":"rapid-prototyping","name":"rapid prototyping","id":54077},{"urlkey":"3d-printing","name":"3D Printing","id":114528}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Shapeways\/","rating":4.63,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/3\/6\/event_16966902.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>Make and share your ideas with 3D printing!

Meditation is the route to that knowing.It is a methodology of science of awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Many meditative techniques require one to sit still and silent. But for most of us accumulated stress in our bodymind makes that difficult. Before we can hope to access our inner powerhouse of consciousness, we need to let go of our tensions.<\/p>\n<p>Osho (1931-1990) is an enlightened mystic who has given many new techniques of active meditations for the inner transformation of the modern man.\u00a0His active meditations like <strong>Dynamic meditation, Kundalini meditation<\/strong>, Nadabrahma meditation are scientifically devised to consciously express and experience repressed feelings and emotions, and learn the knack of watching our habitual patterns in a new way.You can\u00a0find out the science behind some of Osho meditations by clicking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/oshonewyork\/about\/\"><strong><span style=\"color : #ff6600\">here<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Osho's\u00a0techniques give more freedom of expression. At our Meditation Studio , we dance, sing, relax, play, create, and celebrate life with the meditation techniques devised by Osho.\u00a0And while we each can walk this journey of life, of meditation alone, it is more supportive ,more fun, more energetic and vibrant\u00a0to share the process with others in a group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Come share the cosmic dance....a dance where individual energies meet and unite with the cosmic energy !!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For more information on osho meditations visit\u00a0 below<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.osho.com\/Main.cfm?Area=Meditation&amp;Language=English<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Listen 24\/7 Osho Live at <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.osho.com\/\">http:\/\/radio.osho.com<\/a> , Iphone or Android Osho Apps available too.<\/p>\n<p>For Osho News :-\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oshonews.com\">http:\/\/www.oshonews.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Other Popular Sites :-<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oshoworld.com\">http:\/\/www.oshoworld.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tapoban.com\/\">http:\/\/www.tapoban.com\/<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/2\/6\/highres_366099462.jpeg","photo_id":366099462,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/2\/6\/600_366099462.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/2\/6\/thumb_366099462.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12572872,"name":"Osho Meditations","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/9\/a\/highres_10589850.jpeg","photo_id":10589850,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/9\/a\/member_10589850.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/9\/a\/thumb_10589850.jpeg"}},"members":542,"name":"Osho Meditations New York","id":1678324,"state":"NY","urlname":"oshonewyork","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Osho Lovers in NY"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1279714620000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"soapmaking","name":"Soapmaking","id":1876},{"urlkey":"skincare","name":"Skin Care","id":2556},{"urlkey":"skin-care-products","name":"Skin Care Products","id":15271},{"urlkey":"natural-skin-care","name":"Natural Skin Care","id":15808},{"urlkey":"safe-skin-care-cosmetics","name":"Safe Skin Care & Cosmetics","id":18836},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"beauty","name":"Beauty","id":63675}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Soap-Making-Group\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>\n  <span>The New York Soap Making Meetup group is a place where people can learn to make soap and other spa crafts like lip balm, bath fizzies, lotions and any other info that might be related to this craft.&nbsp;\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>Hopefully members will share insights, suggest raw ingredient supply sources, share pictures of their own creations, discuss soapmaking selling points and any other assortment of ideas etc as long as it is related to soapmaking and spa crafts.&nbsp;\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>We want to let our members know about soapmaking blogs, forums, workshops, professional membership.\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>Most of all, we want to hear from you.

It requires an extraordinary amount of time and skill that I seem to never really have. I do, however, have a keen interest in a group where business owners can share their ideas, their triumphs, and failures if they like, so that others can learn and advise.<\/p>\n<p>Most networking groups have people state what they do, over and over each meeting. If I\u2019ve met you once, chances are I have an idea what it is you do. What I really want to know is what is the latest great thing you did for a client, what is the latest great client \u201cGet\u201d you made, what is the latest marketing strategy you are using that I could possibly try. Also, I want to know, as a business owner, what do you think of my business idea, my marketing idea, my strategy? These are the conversations I am interested in having. These are the conversations I think will yield better results for me and for all involved.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to start an informal group around this idea.

Now here's a group to bring single people of different races together to get to know each other, mix it up and possibly date or at the very least make a new friend.<\/p>\n<p>However, in order to join and remain a member of the group ALL members nust adhere to a few rules:<\/p>\n<p>Since this is a dating group ask all members MUST post a picture of themselves within their profiles. Let's fact it when it comes to dating looks do count, so please take a minute or two to post a picture of yourself within your profile and let other members see a face behind the words.<\/p>\n<p>We also ask ALL members to please take a few minutes to fill out our Member Questionnaire, this is an important way for you to introduce yourself, tell us about some of your interests and let everyone know what you're looking for, whether it's casual dating, a possible relationship or just friendship.<\/p>\n<p>Also, since YOU are the most important part of our success, we ask ALL Interracial Dating Group members to do the best they can to ATTEND our meetups.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, we all have lives to lead and jobs to make sure the lights stay on, but what's the point in joining a group if you're not going to participate? This doesn't mean that you have to attend all of our meetups (of course you can if you'd like that'd be great!), but since we now meet every couple of weeks (sometimes MORE!), we ask that you try to make it to at least a quarter of our meetups (that's one every couple of months), that seems fair. Remember there are single people out there who want to meet you so come out to one of our meetups and join the fun.<\/p>\n<p>We ask too that all members try to arrive on time to our meetups (which usually last a couple of hours at least) and if there any problems with the group or other members please feel free to contact whoever is hosting that meetup (or myself) and let them know (granted we're all adults and shouldn't need babysitters, but sometimes stuff happens).<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, there is a small $12\/annual fee to join this meetup group--in order words, only a dollar a month to take part in our monthly meetups as well as other social gatherings and meet other singles who are interested in dating outside their race, in person!<\/p>\n<p>Once you've joined the group always feel free share ideas, give us feedback, let us know how we're doing and rate our meetups, we want your feedback so we can make the group the best that it can be.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<\/p>\n<p>Cleon<\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/a\/b\/highres_17045547.jpeg","photo_id":17045547,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/a\/b\/600_17045547.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/5\/a\/b\/thumb_17045547.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":9142030,"name":"Cleon","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/a\/e\/highres_59676782.jpeg","photo_id":59676782,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/a\/e\/member_59676782.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/f\/a\/e\/thumb_59676782.jpeg"}},"members":306,"name":"Interracial

Our method is called Shared Inquiry and all texts for 2015-2016 season are from the second series of the Great Books Reading and Discussion Program. &nbsp;(You can buy the set of paperbacks and the discussion guide from<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/store.greatbooks.org\/colleges-book-groups\/great-books\/adu-02.html\">Great Books<\/a><span>.) &nbsp;Purchasing the texts is a prerequisite for joining the group and reading the text is a prerequisite for discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For a list of the readings for the upcoming year look at the calendar or download the schedule under \"More\/Files\", the menu item at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p><span>What is Shared Inquiry and how was it developed? Shared Inquiry was developed by Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago in 1947 to help discussion participants explore, interpret and evaluate the sometimes complex and challenging ideas in the great works we discuss. It is an intellectually rigorous activity that focuses on the interpretation of meaning within the written texts. It is Socratic in style and firmly text based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this process participants enjoy the benefits of diverse points of view focused exploration and common discovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each Participant is engaged in an active search for the meaning of the selection at hand. With the energy and encouragement of the group, participants articulate ideas, support assertions with evidence from the text and grapple together with different possibilities of meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>How does it work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There is a \u201cleader\u201d for each selection. The leader has read the text at least twice carefully and has developed interpretive questions\u2014things that puzzled the reader (not questions with specific answers).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>It is NOT a free-wheeling exchange of opinions and testimonials which go outside the text. Questions and discussions are always firmly grounded in the text itself.<\/span> <br> <span>Here are the basic guidelines:<\/span> <br> <span>1. Read the selection carefully before participating in the discussion. Take notes as you read.<\/span> <br> <span>2. Support your ideas with evidence from the text.<\/span> <br> <span>3. Discuss the ideas in the selection and try to understand them fully.<\/span> <br> <span>4. Listen carefully to other participants and respond to them directly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What do you have to do to join?<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br>1. To join the GreatBooks discussion, contact&nbsp; Larry Schiff&nbsp; 917 749 0695, <a href=\"mailto:larry@larryschiff.com\">larry@larryschiff.com<\/a> or Tamara Bedi\u0107&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:tamara_bedic@yahoo.com\">tamara_bedic@yahoo.com<\/a> . <br>2. After clarifying with Larry or Tamara that you would like to discuss the readings based only on what is in the text of the reading, buy the texts from the Great Books Foundation ($28.95 plus shipping and tax) at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/store.greatbooks.org\/colleges-book-groups\/great-books\/adu-02.html\">Great Books<\/a>.<br>3. Read the selection carefully as described above. <br>4. Come in and share (the first Wednesday of each month from 7:00-9:00 PM at the location that Larry or Tamara will send you in an email.) We charge a $5 fee for each meeting to pay for the cost of the room, if you are not a member of the Ethical Culture Society.<\/p>\n<p><span>Check the calendar for exact readings and dates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Many of our current members have been in our group for years.

It is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/\">GNU project<\/a> which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.<\/p>\n<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.<\/p>\n<p>One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.<\/p>\n<p>R is available as Free Software under the terms of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/\">Free Software Foundation<\/a>'s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/COPYING\">GNU General Public License<\/a> in source code form.

As a group we have been playing regularly for the past few years. But as time goes by we've lost more members than have joined due to family, jobs, life, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Our member's love of the game and sportsmanship remain. We play a competitive but relaxed game. We welcome new members and integrate them into football extremely well due to our relaxed nature. We teach and encourage members and treat them with respect. That means not degrading ppl for dropping passes, failing to run routes, etc. Everyone's a newbie at some time and we appreciate that ppl are willing to come out and spend their time with us. This is, after all, a game for FUN!<\/p>\n<p>A new member noted to me \"Wow it's great that it's competitive yet fun. I was in other groups whereby people would scream and yell at one another which made the games less than fun.\" We have guidelines established that resolves conflicts, disagreements quickly. We will kick off any person who is belligerent or degrades others. Fortunately we haven't had to come across this thus far.<\/p>\n<p>As I noted we do play regularly. Ever since we joined meetup we've had many new members. We play pretty much every Sunday at 9AM and we usually have enough people for a full game. We try to get two separate games going at once when we can get 20 people. At our current pace that shouldn't be a problem at all.<\/p>\n<p>We play two hand touch football. We normally play 6 on 6, just QB and receivers. We don't do linemen, kickoffs, flag football, running plays as to reduce injury risks. We've played these previously and tailored our current game to increase the fun and decrease the risks. Games are played until someone scores up to 7 points. If we have two separate games going the winner of each game plays the other to add in a little variety.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don't have a car then please contact our leadership team. We can likely pick you up from a nearby train station. After the first game we can try to get another member to share a ride.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun game with competitive but relaxed people then come to our game. You'll have so much exercise your muscles will hurt the first week but you'll be wanting more afterwards!<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/highres_17797387.jpeg","photo_id":17797387,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/600_17797387.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/2\/0\/b\/thumb_17797387.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12764116,"name":"Michael","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/6\/highres_223116902.jpeg","photo_id":223116902,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/6\/member_223116902.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_223116902.jpeg"}},"members":941,"name":"NYC\/Brooklyn Touch\/Flag Football","id":1697168,"state":"NY","urlname":"BrooklynFootball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1282926301000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"filmind","name":"Film Industry","id":382},{"urlkey":"tvproduction","name":"Television Production","id":1855},{"urlkey":"entertain","name":"Entertainment Industry","id":10269},{"urlkey":"post-production","name":"Post Production","id":15972},{"urlkey":"video-editing","name":"Video Editing","id":18148},{"urlkey":"visual-effects","name":"Visual Effects","id":30987},{"urlkey":"audio-for-post-production","name":"Audio for Post Production","id":75329},{"urlkey":"video-and-computer-animation","name":"Video and computer animation","id":1162242}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-pp\/","rating":4.32,"description":"<p>This is a very casual meetup for people involved in video\/audio post production of any kind.

Meetup is a venue for writers to work in the company of other writers on a regular basis. Writing, whether approached as a profession or as an avocation, is an isolating activity. We provide this forum, writing resources and meeting times as a method of developing a community of creative people. We welcome people who are serious about \u2018writing down the bones\u2019 and are looking for the companionship of other writers.<\/p>\n<p>Meetup Format <br>Making the time to write one hour per week is an empowering and ultimately rewarding experience but it needs to serve as the foundation of your daily discipline. If you RSVP that you are coming, then please arrive 10-15 minutes before the start of the Meetup. The facilitator will lead introductions and then the group will write for an hour. There will then be 15-30 minutes of social time to get to know each other and possibly discuss personal writing successes such as getting published or overcoming writing resistance in some small way. No critiquing, exercises, lectures, ego, competition or feeling guilty.<\/p>\n<p>Writing is the only thing that, when I do it, I don't feel I should be doing something else. <br>Gloria Steinem<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/highres_440329326.jpeg","photo_id":440329326,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/600_440329326.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/0\/a\/e\/thumb_440329326.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":190139677,"name":"Shut Up & Write!","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/f\/f\/e\/highres_248056382.jpeg","photo_id":248056382,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/f\/f\/e\/member_248056382.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/f\/f\/e\/thumb_248056382.jpeg"}},"members":4254,"name":"Shut Up & Write!

Welcome to ChildFreeNYC -- the largest childfree BY CHOICE meetup group in the world. This group is not for parents and is not for people who wanted children but for whatever reason, cannot have them. It is for those who want to celebrate being childfree.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group because the vast majority of my friends cannot relate to me on this important part of life: I've never had any interest in being a parent. Most of my friends and family, whom I love,&nbsp;are the opposite. And most&nbsp;do not understand my choice to forego&nbsp;children. Some think I'm selfish. Others take it personally that I have chosen something that is the opposite of what they've chosen. Meanwhile, I enjoy spending time with their children, but I'm always thrilled to go home and enjoy my childfree life. The problem is that most activities that are fun for me are not fun, or not practical for people with kids. Either they don't want to leave their kids home to go out and have fun, or they can't, because for whatever reason, the demands on their time or their lives prevent them from going out.<\/p>\n<p>I do <span><strong>not<\/strong><\/span> divide the world into people with children &amp; people without children. But I DO want to meet other adults who want to hang out in the city and enjoy what life here can offer to those of us who have more time, flexibility, and freedom (three of the best words in the English language as far as I'm concerned!)<\/p>\n<p><span>As the news outlets &amp; pundits talk about the childfree \"movement,\" I just want to enjoy life without being \"bingo'd\" to death about my lack of interest in being a parent. &nbsp;I'm exhausted from having to answer the questions about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Although there are other childfree meetup groups, all the others I've seen that are in New York City, or near New York City, are not in Manhattan. Several are only for singles or only for couples or only for people in a certain age group. So I started ChildfreeNYC to welcome ALL childfree people, regardless of age or marital status! &nbsp;(We have lots of singles in this group, and lots of couples, and ALL are welcome, as long as you don't pull a lot of \"no shows,\" meaning cancelling within 48 hours of an event. If you RSVP \"yes\" and then you cancel within 48 hours of an event, or you simply do not show up, you will be marked as a \"no show.\" After 3 \"no shows,\" you will be removed fro the group. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is a strict policy, but in the many years of running this group, only a handful of people have been removed because most of our members are good about RSVP'ing accurately. So join us! &nbsp;You can also visit us <\/span><span>on Facebook:<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChildfreeNYC\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChildfreeNYC<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/b\/7\/highres_438431191.jpeg","photo_id":438431191,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/b\/7\/600_438431191.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/b\/7\/thumb_438431191.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13046336,"name":"Madeline Lane","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/3\/highres_249477651.jpeg","photo_id":249477651,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/3\/member_249477651.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/3\/3\/thumb_249477651.jpeg"}},"members":706,"name":"ChildfreeNYC","id":1712529,"state":"NY","urlname":"ChildfreeNYC","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Childfree Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1285551467000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"internetpro","name":"Internet Professionals","id":10102},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"young-entrepreneur","name":"Young Entrepreneur","id":20281},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"business-conference","name":"Business Conference","id":74791},{"urlkey":"marketing-to-young-men","name":"Marketing to young men","id":128150}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BroCon\/","rating":4.4,"description":"<p><strong><span>Education, insights, and opportunities for companies targeting men 18-34 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guyrillamarketing.com\">www.guyrillamarketing.com<\/a>)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/5\/8\/highres_20134136.jpeg","photo_id":20134136,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/5\/8\/600_20134136.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/5\/8\/thumb_20134136.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":19468681,"name":"True Training","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/6\/d\/highres_17881901.jpeg","photo_id":17881901,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/6\/d\/member_17881901.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/6\/d\/thumb_17881901.jpeg"}},"members":94,"name":"BroCon","id":1713225,"state":"NY","urlname":"BroCon","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"BroCon Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Hewlett","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1285600432000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"sahp","name":"Stay at Home Parents","id":10060},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"zumba","name":"Zumba","id":15451},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"parents-of-teens","name":"Parents of Teens","id":15479},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"moms-night-out","name":"Mom's Night Out","id":23946},{"urlkey":"parents-of-tweens","name":"Parents of Tweens","id":26524},{"urlkey":"postpartum-support","name":"Postpartum support","id":30590},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"moms-offering-moms-support","name":"moms giving moms suppoer","id":31176},{"urlkey":"mother-to-mother-inspiring","name":"Mother to Mother Inspiring","id":96619},{"urlkey":"nursery-school-programs","name":"Nursery school programs","id":160910}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/parentfromtheheart2\/","rating":4.56,"description":"<p>This group is an extension of my&nbsp;mission&nbsp;as the founder of&nbsp;Parent From The Heart.&nbsp;

At most of these meetups, speakers of all levels are welcome. This means that quite a large percentage of the conversation tends to be in English.<\/p>\n<p>To learn and improve, it's necessary to immerse oneself and not to feel as if you can just switch to English anytime you want. I have started this meetup to create a place where intermediate, advanced, or native speakers can go and speak entirely in Chinese. Sure, you can translate a word or explain something complicated in English if necessary, but other than that, we're keeping it entirely in Mandarin.<\/p>\n<p>You should join this group and come to this meetup if you can have a basic conversation in Mandarin, if you have lived or traveled in a Chinese-speaking country for some length of time, if you have studied Chinese in school or on your own for a while, or if you are a native speaker. Basically, you should be able to speak Chinese to some extent already if you show up here. The whole goal is to keep the role of English as absolutely minimal as possible when we meet.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, if you are intermediate, don't be intimidated. I myself am hardly fluent, but if you have the basics down and want to improve your vocabulary and natural speaking, the best way to do it is to force yourself to use what you know and expose yourself to things you don't!<\/p>\n<p>If you're not sure whether it is right for you, just ask.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/highres_167459882.jpeg","photo_id":167459882,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/600_167459882.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/e\/a\/thumb_167459882.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":619515,"name":"Dan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/e\/highres_633054.jpeg","photo_id":633054,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/e\/member_633054.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/1\/e\/thumb_633054.jpeg"}},"members":1344,"name":"Advanced

You can be single or coupled, new to NY or born and raised here, but ultimately a chic chick that loves to have a good time!<\/p>\n<p>What I want this group to be about are three things:<\/p>\n<p>1. Going to great events, such as beautiful lounges\/clubs, red carpet screenings, launch events, cocktail receptions\/opening nights, cultural events, or any other event where we can See or Be Seen, mix, mingle, and network with those in all different industries. Basically, any occasion to get dolled up, and put on a cute outfit!<\/p>\n<p>2. Establishing great friendships. I figure if we are like minded, totally normal females, we shouldn't have any trouble making some great connections. We can do that by doing brunch, happy hours, spa days, and anything else we feel like. This is our group, we can do what we want!<\/p>\n<p>3. Getting involved in making a difference. I have this dying need to get involved in the community, raise money for charities, and just help out those in need. I would love to plan events for a specific cause, or work with other organizations to reach a goal. And ideally, maybe even start a NPO. The possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n<p>If this is what you are looking for, I would absolutely love it if you joined this group.

The goal is to visit beautiful and interesting destinations, especially the places that tourists do not normally get to see.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you love to travel solo, as a couple or in a group of friends, you are welcome to join us.

Classes are held once a week on a variety of topics such as anger, deepening relationships, developing contentment, and developing a meditation practice. Although the classes are based on the teachings of Buddhism, you don\u2019t have to be Buddhist to benefit from the teachings.<\/p>\n<p>Classes are offered through the Dharmachakra Buddhist Center, which is a Buddhist meditation center in northern New Jersey that is now offering classes in the Ridgewood area. We offer instruction in meditation and Buddhist spiritual practice. We envision a world based upon compassion and inner peace, where anyone who wishes can travel the path to enlightenment. We are building this world one mind at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Meditation is for everyone, from those who seek relaxation to those who wish to follow the Buddhist spiritual path. Buddhist teachings are for everyone, regardless of spiritual background, and you do not need to be Buddhist to benefit from them. Buddhism is not evangelical. Buddhist teachings are intended as practical advice to solve inner problems and benefit others.<\/p>\n<p>We are dedicated to helping you find happiness from within your own heart and real solutions to your problems through Buddha\u2019s advice. We provide instruction in Buddhist meditation and we promote the teachings and ideals of Kadampa Buddhism in New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>The New Kadampa Tradition is a lineage of Buddhism that is practiced worldwide and is independent of any Asian culture. This lineage was first introduced to the West in 1976 and since then has spread to more than 36 countries and 600 centers worldwide. This lineage originated in India and Tibet, and is presented in contemporary form by the life and works of Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.<\/p>\n<p>As a not-for-profit organization, Dharmachakra Buddhist Center (DBC) relies on the generosity of our students and friends to make our programming possible. Along with fees generated by classes held at DBC and satellite locations, we depend on contributions to meet our expenses. No one is turned away from class because of inability to pay.<\/p>\n<p>You may find more information about our center at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditateNJ.org\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meditateNJ.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.meditateNJ.org<\/a><\/p>","lon":-74.1100006104,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/4\/7\/highres_19986471.jpeg","photo_id":19986471,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/4\/7\/600_19986471.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/9\/4\/7\/thumb_19986471.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11743711,"name":"Peter Kurczynski","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/9\/4\/highres_151789812.jpeg","photo_id":151789812,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/9\/4\/member_151789812.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/c\/2\/9\/4\/thumb_151789812.jpeg"}},"members":825,"name":"Meditation & Dharma in Ridgewood","id":1745558,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Ridgewood-Buddhist-Meditation","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.9799995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1291561204000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"late-night-activities","name":"Late Night Activities","id":34757},{"urlkey":"prospect-heights","name":"Prospect Heights","id":133012}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ProspectNights\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Hang out in a neighborhood filled with great bars, restaurants and people in a Meetup group solely committed to helping you make the most of a gem in the heart of Brooklyn.

Our team is about TEAM!! This means that the pace will be that of the slowest runner to start before the logistics of breaking up is determined. We leave no woman left behind ever! This means if a pair of fast runners are with a slower one you will have to circle back to see how she is doing, run a bit with her, keep the level of motivation up, run and circle back. By doing this you help foster a healthy team environment and still get your running time and distance in. Have a positive domino effect! Anyone who runs off during any group run and leaves a sole sister behind will be removed from the group.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align : left\"><strong><span style=\"color : #f38897 ; font-size : small\">Please do not join this group if you are looking for just another running group to add to your runner's black book.

I have been a part-time Real Estate Investor for 5 of years now. I own a number of rental properties. For the past\u00a08 years, I have had my ups and downs as an investor, but lately I have realized that this is not a solo game, you need friends, partners and lenders. I am not a financial advisor, an accountant or a lawyer, just someone that does this hand\u2019s on and is willing to meet and work with others who do the same.<\/p>\n<p>MY group.<\/p>\n<p>This group is being organized for 2 reasons. The first is that I see a need for people to know how to properly invest in real estate. Everyone makes mistakes, but having someone to talk to is crucial in success. That\u2019s where I come in. I volunteer to help people get involved in real estate. Granted, I am not a millionaire or a \u201cqualified\u201d mentor like those late-night infomercials would have you believe. I am not here to sell you books, or tapes. I am not here to charge any money for seminars or junk like that. I am here to evaluate your purchases, advise on repair work and create a proper team around your so that they can invest properly and with as little risk as possible. The second reason is that I am looking for partners on my personal deals. I am not looking to solicit anyone, but I am coming across stuff that is really great and I need capital to make things happen. In return, I offer training, guidance and returns Wall Steet can only dream of\u2026or at least lie about (see movie \u201cInside Job\u201d for details). My books are transparent and so am I. We can review mine and\/or anyone else\u2019s deals, past successes and\/or failures. I believe in this as a long term goal and would be happy to help you make Main Street a reality for you!<\/p>\n<p>MY goal.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of this network is simple. It is to grow and invest wisely in long term assets that provide a positive return month after month. This game should no longer be for the big boys, everyone should have a chance to invest and live easier. I am simply trying to organize a new group of people, future partners, and investment entrepreneurs who can improve their lives and provide for themselves in the future. Because we both know, neither the government nor Wall Street will do that for you. I am convinced of this now.<br>\n\n Join if you like, but remember: This is for serious investors ONLY. We will be analyzing deals constantly. We will be visiting prospective purchases and locations. Our Meetups will be in different parts of NY\/NJ\/PA, they will not be in a conference room most of the time.

We created online maps from satelllite images, put SMS and media reports onto an Ushahidi map, got documents into Sahana, added the details of people who were lost into Google's People Finder tool, built websites and software to help, and did dozens of other small data jobs that made a difference to what was available online and in the country (we even sent data updates into the country on USB sticks). Since then, we've mapped in places like Libya (refugees), Japan (tsunami), Chile (earthquake), Pakistan (floods), Somalia (refugees), Alabama (tornadoes) and been ready to help with dozens of other crises around the world.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Crisismappers are usually volunteers: many of them are highly-skilled both at data gathering, mapping and analysis, and in areas which impact this work (like open-source technologies), but if you're new to crisismapping, don't let that put you off joining in: everyone starts as a newbie sometime, and many of those skills were gained through hours of working on maps.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>What's this crisismapping meetup about?<\/strong><\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n This meetup is open to anyone working on crisismapping, working with crisismappers or interested in crisismapping in general.

We're all about achieving new feats individually as well as building close ties with one another.<\/p>\n<p>In order to be a member, you should have both the fitness and passion to hike 2500'-7500' of elevation gain at a steady pace over 10-20+ miles in our 3-season day hikes (and 20-50+ miles in our 3-season weekend backpacking trips, with 5000'-10000'+ of elevation gain) <em>and<\/em> the openness of spirit to enter into a community of like-minded trail lovers.

As a committed member, you'll see many of the same faces month after month.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. &nbsp;Everyone will read verses together from the Bhagavad Gita, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. &nbsp;Atma and Subhie will together explain the Bhagavad Gita verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for a combined forty years.&nbsp; We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p>\n<p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful Bhagavad Gita As It Is with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation&nbsp;of $10.<\/p>\n<p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. &nbsp;Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the Bhagavad Gita by the name Krishna.<\/p>\n<p><span>Here is&nbsp;the general schedule of our&nbsp;meetups:&nbsp;we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.&nbsp; Then, we&nbsp;have a class on Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which lasts&nbsp;for about an hour and a half. &nbsp;In the class, we will go through verses of the Gita in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. &nbsp;By about 7:30, the last kirtan&nbsp;begins;&nbsp;it lasts for about 30 minutes. &nbsp;A&nbsp;sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Admission to each meetup is free. &nbsp;Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and Bhagavad Gita. &nbsp;He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship for 75% of tuition. &nbsp;Currently, Atma spends his weekdays as a securities fraud federal prosecutor. &nbsp;His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. &nbsp;Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. &nbsp; From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught Bhagavad Gita in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. &nbsp;Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. &nbsp;After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. &nbsp;Subhie also got her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College. &nbsp;She is currently an elementary school teacher.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/highres_48722961.jpeg","photo_id":48722961,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/600_48722961.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/9\/1\/thumb_48722961.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13758142,"name":"Atma & Subhie","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/b\/b\/e\/highres_11748062.jpeg","photo_id":11748062,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/b\/b\/e\/member_11748062.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/b\/b\/e\/thumb_11748062.jpeg"}},"members":315,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","id":1764957,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Montclair","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1294903622000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"international-travel","name":"International Travel","id":16179},{"urlkey":"weekend-adventures","name":"Weekend Adventures","id":16438},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"day-trips","name":"Day Trips","id":20423},{"urlkey":"women-who-travel","name":"Women Who Travel","id":23496},{"urlkey":"weekend-getaways","name":"Weekend Getaways","id":28784},{"urlkey":"women-solo-travel","name":"Women Solo Travel","id":30913},{"urlkey":"solo-travel","name":"Solo Travel","id":30915},{"urlkey":"mens-solo-travel","name":"Men's Solo Travel","id":49243},{"urlkey":"travel-for-men-and-women","name":"Travel for Men and Women","id":102440},{"urlkey":"learning-about-world-travel","name":"Learning about World Travel","id":122266}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Northern-New-Jersey-World-Travellers-Over-30-Meetup-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for people who enjoy travelling and would like to exchange travel information, tips, stories and learn about different places in the world.

<br \/>There is a movement of self-sufficiency, preparedness, self-reliance and survival. These people have many names ranging from self-reliant, preppers, homesteaders, and survivalist. All share a need for quality of life, economic adaptation, and if necessary survive a catastrophic local or global event.  <br \/>New and wanting to learn how to get started or someone with experience, this group may have the missing pieces you are still searching to find.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>&ldquo;IT&rdquo; could happen? <br \/>Many &ldquo;IT&rdquo; events HAVE happened some place in the world within the last 10 years and can happen again: Spree killings, Terrorist Attacks (Massive arson, Dirty bombs, chemical attacks, biological attacks, cyber-attacks, EMP attacks), Natural Disasters (pandemics, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, Massive forest fires, floods, mud-slides, famine, Solar storm EMP), Industrial accidents (Nuclear accidents, electrical grid collapse, chemical accidents), Economic collapse and &ldquo;Unknown X Factors.&rdquo; Turn your fear into action and feel secure because of your own efforts of self-preparedness.<\/p>\r\n<p>No SANE person wants \"IT\" to happen<\/p>\r\n<p>I LIVE in A CITY! <br \/>When someone gets serious about the survival of loved ones and themselves, they start looking for answers. You like me may have found that 98% of the books and websites are focused on what I call &ldquo;Wild World Survival.&rdquo; Bush craft and wilderness survival define &ldquo;Wild World Survival.&rdquo; The killer APP for &ldquo;Wild World Survival&rdquo; is found in fire making. Are you tried of how to survive after being lost in woods information?<\/p>\r\n<p>I live in the city and want to survive in my city. This group is for city apartment dwellers to suburban homeowners who want to turn their space into a LIFEPOD. The &ldquo;Prepping In The City&rdquo; Meetup group is Not about &ldquo;Bush craft&rdquo; or &ldquo;wilderness survival.&rdquo; This group is about the realities of surviving and thriving around glass, steel and concrete. Survival in the big city is about planning, design and construction. It takes careful design based planning, science and engineering.<\/p>\r\n<p>Do you refuse to live life no farther back than the 1900s? This MeetUp group will focus on how to live well in the world NOW and survive any future event to live well again. Our goal is to provide knowledge for both individuals and groups to survive and thrive before, during and after a major disaster or civil breakdown. How to effectively take action independent of waiting for private or government organizations to come to the rescue.  People can die from waiting. This knowledge is deployed in urban environments preparation-projects far in advance of  &ldquo;IT&rdquo; events.<\/p>\r\n<p>Meetups will consist of both learning clinics and in depth workshops. Learning formats are fee based. During clinics and workshops, both &ldquo;basic level preps&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardcore level preps&rdquo; will be discussed and demonstrated.<\/p>\r\n<p>Basic Level-if you are on a tight budget and want the most economical answers. You just want to be prepared without having to make a larger commitment of space to gear.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hardcore Level- is for the extreme obsessive person who wants to cover all possible scenarios and may just be a major gear head at heart anyway.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both levels come with explanations of what to do with each tool in each type of situation. <br \/>What good are tools if you have no clue how they can help you stay alive.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Prepping in the city&rdquo; Meetup Group will also function as a &ldquo;Preppers Wingman club,&rdquo; the place where you can find prepping partners. The group is a resource to build and complete your &ldquo;IT&rdquo; event survival team.<\/p>\r\n<p>Will also take many deep dives into the cognitive Science of Survival.

Then, we hire dance teachers, art teachers, music teachers, and sports coaches to conduct the classes.

Some classes may cap out at a certain number of toddlers, thus sign up is on a first come, first serve basis. Classes may also get rescheduled or cancelled if the minimum number of toddlers is not met, and payments will be appropriately refunded. We hope for this never to happen, which is why spreading the word of this group is so vital to the success!<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><span style=\"font-size : medium\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong><span style=\"font-size : small\">The benefits of this group:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color : #000000\"><span style=\"font-size : small\">1.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Cost effective<\/strong>- since we hire the teachers\/coaches ourselves, the cost is much lower, per class, than anywhere else.
