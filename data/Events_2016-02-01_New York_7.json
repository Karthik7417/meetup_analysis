We\u2019ll also look at the cross-platform side of .NET, running on OS X and Linux as well as Windows, and discuss what it means to have .NET as an Open Source Project. <b>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Nick Landry \u2013 Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft<\/b><\/p> <p>Nick Landry (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActiveNick\">@ActiveNick<\/a>) is a mobility pioneer and former entrepreneur specializing in cross-platform mobile app development for Windows, iOS and Android devices.

Leveraging the information \u00a0present in the EHR is not a trivial step, however, especially when it comes to the information conveyed in clinical notes. In this talk I will focus on one of the challenges faced by the EHR and its users: information overload.\u00a0 With ever-growing longitudinal health records, it is difficult for clinicians to keep track of what is salient to their information needs when treating individual patients. I will present two applications and their methods: a disease progression model that learns from the longitudinal patient record, and HARVEST, a real-time summarisation system deployed at New York-Presbyterian \u00a0Hospital.<\/p> <p><b>Noemie Elhadad <\/b>(<a href=\"http:\/\/people.dbmi.columbia.edu\/noemie\">people.dbmi.columbia.edu\/noemie<\/a>) is an Associate Professor in the Biomedical Informatics, affiliated with Computer Science at Columbia University.

Now I have met a few of you and gotten to know you. Some of you already know what your passions are but need a support group to get to where you want to go. Others have no clue what their passions are.<\/p> <p>So now I am officially starting the weekly Thursday meetings for New York Dreams Come True.<\/p> <p>Here is the agenda for how the night will go:<\/p> <p>I.\u00a0 Introduction And Ice Breaker [6:30pm-6:45pm]<\/p> <p>\u00ad\u00adEveryone gets a nametag and signs in. New members will use this time to fill out a quick new member form. Introduce your name, current career, and dream career. We start off the meeting with a small icebreaker to make everyone more engaged and comfortable around each other.<\/p> <p>Tonight's Icebreaker: What award would you love to win and for what achievement?<\/p> <p>II.\u00a0 Incantations [6:45pm - 6:50pm]<\/p> <p>Incantations are one of the most powerful ways to change your life. An incantation is an empowering phrase (affirmations) that you verbalize loudly and with absolute certainty. Incantations induce a new physiology and instantly cultivate new beliefs.<\/p> <p>Tonight's Incantations: Deep down, I already know what my life's passions and purpose are. I am free to express my natural talents and skills. I have the time and money to dedicate to my passions.<\/p> <p>III.\u00a0 Define Your Values [6:50pm - 7:20pm]<\/p> <p>Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work. They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to. When the things that you do and the way you behave match your values, life is usually good \u2013 you're satisfied and content. But when these don't align with your personal values, that's when things feel... wrong. This can be a real source of unhappiness. This is why making a conscious effort to identify your values is so important.<\/p> <p>IV.\u00a0 Break Time [7:20pm - 7:30pm]<\/p> <p>Socialize and take a bathroom break.<\/p> <p>V.\u00a0 Accountability Group [7:30pm - 8:00pm]<\/p> <p>This is a group discussion activity. This is a chance to brainstorm ideas and express concerns regarding pursuing your passion. Then finally, leave the meeting being held accountable for an action that will bring you one step closer to your dreams. Choose one action that you want complete by next Thursday that will make all the difference in the world for you.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Take the F\/G to Smith-9th Street.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness.

The practices of CR help us navigate discord in relationships, developing new ways of working with difficult situations. The CR course has three main threads that weave together and support each other.\u00a0 1) Resilience and meditation skills. These allow us to become more aware of how our minds operate, and provides basis for relating compassionately to the many movements of mind.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2) Simple yet profound communication skills. These apply the resilience and meditation skills from the first tread within interpersonal dynamics.<\/p> <p>3) A scientific framework. Biology and neuroscience are used to understand both why some form of practice is necessary if we are to live satisfying lives, and why particular practices work.\u00a0 Practices<br\/>\u2022 Basic communication practices include: embodied listening, paraphrased reflection, seeking to understand others, expressing self-understanding, requests and boundaries<br\/>\u2022 Resilience practices include: recalling and forming memories of wellbeing, by becoming aware of comfort and ease in the present moment.<br\/>\u2022 Meditation practices include: mindfulness of breathing, body scan, open monitoring, phrases of forgiveness, and loving-kindness (metta).<br\/>\u2022 Scientific topics include: the biology of perception, unconsciousness, preferences, hyper-arousal and social roles and counter roles<\/p> <p>About The Instructor: \u00a0<br\/>William LaRue Ph.D. has been taking courses in relationship dynamics since 1985 and loves to reflect on and practice what he's learned. He's a Ph.D in evolutionary biology, a longterm Buddhist mediator, and a former Special Ops Solider in the U.S. Army.

It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p><br\/>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

His belief in \"the infinitude of the private man\" still resonates with spiritual seekers today. Most people know Emerson's essay, \"Self-Reliance,\" but there is much more to the fascinating life of the man and his circle, which included Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Margaret Fuller. You will never look at Emerson - or yourself - quite the same way again.<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Why should we not also enjoy an original relation to the universe?

Skiing? Snowshoeing? Cross country skiing? Skating? Or just hanging out and cooking? Sign up for this favorite winter meetup!<\/p> <p>STATUS: We're fully booked and have no available spots. If you want to come with us, you'll need to arrange for your own accommodation and lift tickets in Stratton. We still have some carpool spots available leaving on Thursday afternoon and returning on Sunday. You can also take a bus on Friday. If you want to come, please e-mail me ASAP.<\/p> <p>MORE INFO: Blaze&gt;&gt; has already organized several very successful skiing meetups; check out the last\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blazenyc\/events\/203842132\/\">Winter Weekend in Stratton, VT<\/a>. We will ski, snowboard, xc-ski, snowshoe, skate, cook, play Mafia and Cards Against Humanity - simply have a fun weekend in Vermont this winter as well.<\/p> <p><br\/>We have a new arrival option this year: We will leave to Stratton in three waves: on Wednesday 1\/20\/16 after work (no dinner in the condos, cheap skiing on Thu, Fri), on Thursday 1\/21\/16, and on Friday 1\/22\/16. All of us will return on Sunday 1\/24\/16. We plan to carpool or, if necessary, rent cars. Cost of the accommodation will be around $280, $350, or $420 depending on the length of your stay (2, 3, or 4 nights, weeknights are cheaper). Lift tickets, gear rentals, food, drinks, and transportation are extra; however, we will get a BIG group discount if at least 25 people sign up. The final balance will be reconciled at the end of the trip via the usual money spreadsheet.<\/p> <p>As last year, also this year we will have more choice regarding accommodation. Those who want to have their own bedroom (occupied by only one person) will have that option (the cost will be as if two people shared the bedroom; i.e., 2x). And those who want to save money can choose to sleep on a sleeper sofa in the living room (no privacy, less comfort, but you will pay only half the regular price; i.e., 0.5x). Everyone else will be in a lottery to share their king\/queen bed or have their own twin bed, two people per room.<\/p> <p>The condos have fully equipped kitchens with granite countertops, dining room area with a family size table, and a living room with a washer\/dryer, TV, phone, and a cozy gas fireplace. Amenities include an outdoors heated pool, hot tub, and a sauna. The slopes are a 10-minute walk. See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stratton.com\">Stratton, VT<\/a> for details. Even if you don't ski much, you'll enjoy the gourmet cooking and games we'll play.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you have any question, post them in the comments or e-mail me. I will e-mail everyone on the RSVP list in the beginning of November, asking to pay a deposit. The deposit has to be paid by the end of November to have a guaranteed spot. In December I will e-mail you with info how to order deeply discounted lift tickets and rental and to arrange carpooling. And in January you will receive an e-mail with the final instructions. We will also have a social meetup in the city about a week before the trip.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Milos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/blazenyc\/events\/225172046\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":172800000,"name":"7th Annual Winter Weekend in Stratton, VT","id":"225172046","time":1453510800000,"updated":1454039638000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1222233166000,"name":"BLAZE >> Backpacking Gay Men of NYC","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":1288466,"urlname":"blazenyc","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Backpackers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"301 West 39th Street","name":"Club Mass","lon":-73.991463,"id":24276644,"state":"NY","lat":40.755596,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.394805669785,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1372175999000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Friday Bachateame Mama at 301 West 39th Street!

Fannish devotion to detail (arms and equipment, troop types, tactical deployment) gives a different perspective than academic historians, one that is more visual, tactile and full of the nerd-squee that keeps us coming to comic cons year after year. In this lecture, we\u2019ll turn the wargaming-nerd\u2019s lens on one of history\u2019s greatest battles: Cannae, 216 BC, the 140,000 man knife-fight that changed the world.<\/p> <p>Bio: Myke Cole is the author of the military fantasy SHADOW OPS series (CONTROL POINT, FORTRESS FRONTIER and BREACH ZONE). His latest novel, GEMINI CELL is out now. As a secu\u00adrity con\u00adtractor, gov\u00adern\u00adment civilian and mil\u00adi\u00adtary officer, Myke Cole\u2019s career has run the gamut from Coun\u00adtert\u00ader\u00adrorism to Cyber War\u00adfare to Fed\u00aderal Law Enforce\u00adment. He\u2019s done three tours in Iraq and was recalled to serve during the Deep\u00adwater Horizon oil spill. He has his master\u2019s in Museum Studies, and has written for the journals of the American Historical Association and the American Association of Museums.<\/p> <p>*Presentation #3<br\/>When ______ Met ______ \u2026: The Hollywood Formula\u2019s Mad-Libs Approach to Characters<br\/>by Dawson Smith<\/p> <p>Description: We all think we know what people mean by \u201cThe Hollywood Formula,\u201d and can picture the MacGuffins, chase scenes, gratuitous sex between leads with no chemistry, and shootouts in steamy foundries that come with it. That\u2019s not really what it means, though. It\u2019s an actual concept that has determined the three main characters in Hollywood movies since the golden age of cinema. And we\u2019re gonna talk about it.<\/p> <p>Bio: Dawson Smith is a writer, lawyer, and gadabout, though not particularly accomplished at any one of those things. Professionally, he does TV production, so if you want to give him money for that, sidle up to him after the show. He\u2019s obsessed with story theory and forcing other peoples\u2019 art into his ordered little boxes so that he can dissect it in ways only beautiful to him.<\/p> <p>Matt<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Find the event at Le Poisson Rouge and online at http:\/\/nyc.nerdnite.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/new-york-brainiacs\/events\/228061425\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Nerd Nite","id":"228061425","time":1453513500000,"updated":1453526296000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1221950508000,"name":"New York Brainiacs Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1286261,"urlname":"new-york-brainiacs","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Brainiacs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"08840","country":"us","city":"Metuchen","address_1":"215 Durham Avenue","name":"Metuchen Sportsplex","lon":-74.371872,"id":8697892,"state":"NJ","lat":40.542461,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":36,"headcount":0,"distance":24.6755084991,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1452961716000,"fee":{"amount":12,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Details on how to pay for the event are posted in the message board: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612\/#[masked]\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/messages\/boards\/thread\/49450612\/#[masked]<\/a><br\/>Happy 1,000 members week!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club\/events\/228134091\/","yes_rsvp_count":36,"duration":7200000,"name":"Volleyball Open Gym","id":"228134091","time":1453514400000,"updated":1453523314000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344491820000,"name":"Greater Metro Area Volleyball Club (GMAVC)","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":4504982,"urlname":"Greater-Metro-Area-Volleyball-Club","group_lat":40.5400009155,"who":"VBallers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Webinar","name":"Webinar","lon":-74.005943,"id":24069437,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":3,"created":1450145646000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0BGP \u00a0<\/p> <p>3.7.1.

We do expect snow to start around 6AM Saturday but that's the beginning and the accumulation shouldn't be bad. If Saturday is canceled we may try for this Sunday.<\/p> <p>Our games are normally smooth and fun. There was quite a bit of bickering last week which is not acceptable. If you are blocking with your body, shoulder, or elbow instead of your hands that is unacceptable. Neither should you block and seek to push someone to the ground. Being competitive is not an excuse to such physical play\u00a0and leads to unnecessary injuries and arguments. Name calling or belittling someone is also not acceptable. The persons responsible last week have been warned. Going forward\u00a0anyone engaging in these activities\u00a0will be issued a formal warning the first time, suspended a month the second time, and banned for life the third time. This is not a democracy and you will not get a trial. Our decisions are final so do NOT put yourself and us in this spot. Likewise if you believe someone is playing unfairly then talk it out with that person (like an adult and calmly) and report it to the leaders if this continues.<\/p> <p>It's very unfortunate GP got injured on a non-contact injury. Linus from Charlie Brown had his blanket for comfort. GP had his under armour shirt but it was cut up in the hospital (I believe). We are all friends and family here so if you're interested we're taking contributions so we can get him a card and gift card. Even if it's not for a shirt maybe he can buy a left handed mouse.\u00a0The amount is up to your discretion. Please contact Mike if you're interested.<\/p> <p>Lastly, the Superbowl is in a few weeks. I'm thinking of doing a box contest. Since this will be for fun and bragging rights it will only cost $1 per box with a max of 4 entries per person. If we sell out all the boxes then the winner of each of the first 3 quarters will get $20 and the winner of quarter 4 will get $40. The numbers for the sides of the boxes will be chosen next week in front of everyone that attends. Again, contact Mike if you are interested.<\/p> <p>So unless the weather gets so bad that you can't drive a block away then we will be playing!<\/p> <p>***************<\/p> <p>\u00a0<br\/>Attendance will be strictly enforced. No-shows will be marked and posted on the subsequent meetup. First time offenders will be given the benefit of doubt, second time offenders will be warned (consider your name in this email and the number of times you no-showed as warning) and those who miss a third time will be banned,permanently!\u00a0Those that show up without RSVP to circumvent this will be warned as well. We need to know how many people will show up in order to decide if we have enough people for a game that week.<\/p> <p>All new members are allowed to play for free the first three games. If you decide to continue with us then please remit the membership fee. Our season starts on 9\/1 and the $10 is good for all games for the year.<\/p> <p>By attending our games you agree to assume any and all risks involved in these games.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the orange cones","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BrooklynFootball\/events\/228264613\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":12600000,"name":"SATURDAY Football 01\/23\/16 - Please READ full message!","id":"228264613","time":1453555800000,"updated":1453569956000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1282846082000,"name":"NYC\/Brooklyn Touch\/Flag Football","group_lon":-74.0199966431,"id":1697168,"urlname":"BrooklynFootball","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"PIER 2","name":"Pier 2 Brooklyn Bridge Park Sports Field  ","lon":-73.99679,"id":20415762,"state":"NY","lat":40.699024,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":0,"distance":3.54729747772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452968432000,"fee":{"amount":4,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Details:<\/p> <p>1 game (7 v 7) : Two halves of 30 minutes each with a break in between<\/p> <p>-Please bring a fun and chill attitude.

The day was jam packed but kept us thoughtful and engaged. The panel discussion was terrific and the feedback of current entrepreneurs is essential for crafting an approach and rethinking weaker points of one\u2019s business plan.\u201d\u2014 Kathleen Blakistone, Los Angeles 2015<\/p> <p>\u201cYou were all great...it was the best workshop and the most bang for the buck anyone could ask for! Extreme clarity for me although I\u2019m well in the process of my startup. Regardless it helped to solidify my ideas and plans. LFL is helping for the change that is so badly needed.\u201d\u2014 Peter Schrager, San Francisco 2015<\/p> <p>\u201cThe 12-point business plan, especially the powerpoint example, was most helpful. It was surprising how effectively the bootcamp could address the concerns and questions of a wide variety of entrepreneurs in the group. Finally, I appreciated the candid answers from the panel. Very inspiring. Keep up the good work!\u201d\u2014 Linda Shiue, San Francisco, 2015<\/p> <p>\u201cEven with an extremely nascent business plan the bootcamp helped me realize in what direction I could take all of my ideas. The recommendations on customer development and positioning strategy were especially useful for tailoring my over-zealous thinking and helping me focus on one competitive edge at a time.\u201d\u2014 Michelle Cashen, New York City, 2014<\/p> <p>\u201cThe business plan and survey exercises increased my confidence to move forward with the start-up process. The exercises were very valuable practice which helped me answer questions I was unable to answer before.\u201d\u2014 Gail Samuels, San Francisco, 2015<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we had an opportunity to have a group like LFL come and share this type of info and bring so many of people like us, seeking guidance, together in a group setting...great networking opportunity.\u201d\u2014 Liliana Alvarado, Washington D.C., 2014<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"http:\/\/localfoodlab.com\/classes\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Food-Startup-Bootcamp\/events\/226914735\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Food Startup Bootcamp","id":"226914735","time":1453561200000,"updated":1453573180000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1415294994000,"name":"NYC Food Startup Bootcamp","group_lon":-74,"id":18116592,"urlname":"NYC-Food-Startup-Bootcamp","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Food Entrepreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"World Trade Center 4, 46 Floor, 150 Greenwich St.","name":"MediaMath","lon":-74.012909,"id":24265168,"state":"NY","lat":40.710854,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":60,"headcount":0,"distance":2.9648668766,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447951742000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>All,<\/p> <p>Due to the storm being upgraded and a travel advisory being released for the NYC\/NJ area, I have to close MediaMath\u2019s office as a local HQ for the GopherGala this weekend.

Nitrox is another tool for divers to use. It is not designed to replace air. Nitrox is ideal for recreational diving. You can gain a safety advantage OR longer bottom times using Nitrox. In either case, many divers report less fatigue and a sense of well-being after Nitrox dives.<br\/>In addition to feeling better after diving, the decrease of of nitrogen accumulation also allows:<\/p> <p>Increased safety margins when using dive computers.<\/p> <p>A significant increase in bottom time no-decompression limits when using Nitrox tables.<\/p> <p>A reduction of decompression time if the no-decompression limits are exceeded.<\/p> <p>A reduction of possible decompression illness.<\/p> <p>Reduces the effects of Nitrogen Narcosis.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What is Nitrox?<\/b><br\/>Nitrox is simply any mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Air is made up of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. The name \"Nitrox\" usually refers to oxygen-nitrogen mixtures containing more than 21% oxygen. Other names for this gas are EANx, Enriched Air Nitrox and Safe Air. There are two standard Nitrox mixtures. Nitrox containing 32% oxygen and Nitrox containing 36% oxygen.<\/p> <p><b>Why should I use Nitrox?<\/b><br\/>The main benefit to diving with Nitrox is the reduced amount of nitrogen in your breathing gas. Less nitrogen means less risk of getting decompression sickness (DCS), or \"the bends\". Using Nitrox can also extend your bottom time. Because no-decompression limits are based on nitrogen absorption, less nitrogen means more bottom time. Many divers also claim that they feel less fatigued after diving with Nitrox (as compared to diving with air).<\/p> <p><b>Why do I need a Nitrox Course?<\/b><br\/>Nitrox, like all other breathing gases (including air), has its safe limits at depth so it is very important to know and understand these limits before you make your first Nitrox dive.

Specifically childhood. Esther Freud's first novel <i>Hideous Kinky<\/i> earned her being named one of the 20 best young British novelists in 1993. The book is just shy of 200 pages, making it an easy post-holiday-season-hangover read.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This novel is semi-autobiographical and based on the author's own experience of traveling with her mother in North Africa between the ages of four and six. Weaving between the vivid descriptions of life on the move, the desert, and its cast of exotic characters, is a deeply moving tale of what it's like as a child to be part of an unconventional family. Freud is the daughter of the artist Lucien and great-granddaughter of Sigmund; childhood was unlikely ever to be normal. The novel beautifully evokes the bohemian life that she and her sister unwittingly witnessed as children, all the while craving a more stable upbringing.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Hideous Kinky<\/i> is the story of a hippie mother and her daughters who travel to Morocco. Events are narrated through the voice of 5-year-old Lucia. As their mother immerses herself in Sufism in her quest for personal fulfillment and spiritual enlightenment, the girls' longing for a normal upbringing intensifies.

So if you're not already carpooling northward, let's shred some handrails and\/or try to get to a local mountain.<\/p> <p>There are three of us so far, and we're starting tomorrow as soon as the snow starts piling up. We're planning on a riding some handrails at a local spot in Edgewater, NJ (see below) during the day, then Mountain Creek or the Poconos in the evening, into the night. We're playing Sunday by ear.\u00a0We have a hatchback with AWD and shovels, and one seat open for the evening adventure (can pick up in the Jersey City area, depending on road conditions). \u00a0It could be a ton of fun, so comment or message an organizer to make plans to meet up for one or both sessions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The video and photo below are of a great spot in Edgewater, NJ just across the Hudson River from Mid-town Manhattan. It's where we're starting as soon as there's enough snow. It's eight sets of 15-25 stair, round, down-rails. It's an incredible set up. The drop-ins are perfect and the rails are really wide. And you can do lines! No joke. We know the place pretty well, it's a lot of fun. If it snows like they say it's going to, there will be all sorts of shred-related urban fun to be had there (and probably anywhere else). Who's game? Let's go shred.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2AVhRYacaNc\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/2AVhRYacaNc<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/3\/8\/8\/event_446133672.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAnd here are links to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountaincreek.com\/\">Mountain Creek<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jfbb.com\/\">BBJF<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShred soon,<\/p> <p>Jay and the Shredshare Team<\/p> <p>www.shredshare.io<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"comment on the meetup, email team@shredshare.io or text 646 598 SNOW","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-Ski-and-Snowboard-Carpools\/events\/228296794\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":122400000,"name":"[This weekend!] Local Shred Mission: NYC & Mountain Creek","id":"228296794","time":1453568400000,"updated":1453691800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1442503998000,"name":"NY\/NJ SKI and SNOWBOARD CARPOOLS","group_lon":-74,"id":18941144,"urlname":"NY-NJ-Ski-and-Snowboard-Carpools","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Carpoolers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Merrick","address_1":"1832 Ada Place  Merrick ny 11566","name":"Dave's Ranch","lon":-73.560356,"id":24265307,"state":"NY","lat":40.666046,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.2857189178,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452978760000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next week - we will review from Lesson 1 , then new material.<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As discussed , I will probably be adding extra time to our session so as to<\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 meet each person's individual needs.

Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our focus is a systematic and thematic, but not difficult to understand, study of the <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>. \u00a0Everyone will read verses together from the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>, copies of which will be provided for attendees to reference during the meetup. \u00a0Atma and Subhie will together explain the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> verses according to the ancient tradition that they have studied and lived by for almost fifty years, combined.\u00a0 We will learn about various fascinating topics, such as karma, reincarnation, the soul, the material energy, the Supreme Soul, time, and the relationship between the soul, the material energy, and the Supreme Soul.<\/p> <p>Hard cover copies of the beautiful <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i> with the original 700 sanskrit verses, translations, and elaborate purports by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, will be available for any member who might choose to take one home for a suggested donation\u00a0of $10.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended for everyone who is interested without discrimination and regardless of one's familiarity with the subject matter. \u00a0Please come and relish this most wonderful discussion and kirtan, celebrating the glories of bhakti yoga, i.e., devotional service to God, who is known according to the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> by the name Krishna.<\/p> <p>Here is\u00a0the general schedule of our\u00a0meetups:\u00a0we begin the evening with a kirtan that lasts about half an hour -- until about 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 Then, we\u00a0have a class on <i>Bhagavad-gita As It Is<\/i>, which lasts\u00a0for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the class, we will go through verses of the <i>Gita<\/i> in order, continuing from where the last class left off, with questions pertaining to those verses being encouraged throughout the class. \u00a0By about 7:30, the last kirtan\u00a0begins;\u00a0it lasts for about 30 minutes. \u00a0A\u00a0sumptuous and nutritious vegetarian dinner is served after that.<\/p> <p>Admission to each meetup is free. \u00a0Donations for the meetup's expenses are welcome, but not at all required!<\/p> <p>Atma is an initiated priest who since 1990 has been studying, teaching, and living according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> as taught and followed by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. After living in a monastic setting for eight years, Atma resumed his undergraduate education at Brown University, where he hosted weekly programs that focused on kirtan and <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i>. \u00a0He then enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School from which he graduated in 2004 and from which he received a merit scholarship. \u00a0Atma practices law in Long Island and New York City, with his concentration in securities law. \u00a0His primary goal is to imbibe in his own life the devotional teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> and to share the same with others as a humble offering to God.<\/p> <p>Subhie has been living her life according to the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> since 1991 and is also an initiated priest. \u00a0Subhie lived in a monastic setting until 2005. \u00a0 From 1991 to 2005, Subhie taught <i>Bhagavad-gita<\/i> in Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Germany, and United Kingdom. \u00a0Subhie spent several years studying Vedic knowledge in India, primarily in the holy town, Vrindavana. \u00a0After 2005, Subhie resumed her undergraduate education in religion at the University of London -- and then locally at Queens College, after she moved to New York and married Atma. \u00a0Subhie completed her Master's degree in teaching at Queens College and is a school teacher.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The meeting is at 26 2nd Avenue, between 1st St. and 2nd St. You can take the F train and get off at the 2nd Ave. stop (and use the 2nd Ave. exit at that station).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita\/events\/227938001\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"CANCELLED: Saturday, Jan. 23 Gita\/Kirtan Program at 26 2nd Ave.","id":"pckzryvcbfc","time":1453588200000,"updated":1453600383000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1294890223000,"name":"Kirtan Yoga & Bhagavad Gita As It Is Discourses -- NYC","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1764957,"urlname":"Kirtan-and-Discourses-on-Bhagavad-Gita","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10023","country":"us","city":"New York","phone":"(212) 799-5433","address_1":"131 W 72nd St","name":"Ripley Grier 72","lon":-73.979852,"id":732693,"state":"NY","lat":40.778106,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.01729440689,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452627760000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"deposit","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Your chance to learn how to Dance Tango is FINALLY here!<\/p> <p>Bring your partner or just come by yourself.<\/p> <p>This is an introductory Tango course to learn the basics so you get a good taste of it.

This event requires registration on our website.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/sketching-bootcamp-using-visuals-to-sell-ideas-and-solve-problems-tickets-19727546623\">Sign-up here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>Sketching Bootcamp:\u00a0Using Visuals to Sell Ideas and Solve Problems<\/p> <p>Whiteboard (or flipchart) sketching is the fastest and easiest way to convey your ideas, to help shape the conversations in meetings and foster team alignment\u2026yet many of us don\u2019t feel comfortable in the front of the room with a marker in hand.<\/p> <p>In one dynamic day, you\u2019ll get a basic framework for selling ideas, solving problems and sketching complex information in an engaging way. We\u2019ll focus on enhancing your visual vocabulary and building your confidence to create compelling visuals in your everyday work. An expanded visual vocabulary means drawing boxes and arrows that sing, people that don\u2019t look like blobs and leaving with a back pocket full of visual frameworks for all the things you have to communicate.<\/p> <p>WHY SPEND A WHOLE DAY DRAWING?<\/p> <p>At The Design Gym we\u2019ve been teaching collaborative skills and facilitation for years, to thousands of people. In that time, we\u2019ve witnessed those who are comfortable sketching at the wall being able to command a workshop using visualization to pull the best out of others on their team.<\/p> <p>We\u2019re finding that greater visualization skills have become expected in creative fields and a huge differentiator in any role within an organization where selling or conveying ideas is important.We\u2019ve also found that as work projects become more complex, visuals become a way to explain complex or confusing ideas to diverse groups.Generally, visuals you create during a meeting will be more memorable and create better alignment for the team.<\/p> <p>WHAT WILL I LEARN AND TAKE BACK TO WORK?<\/p> <p>1. VISUAL VOCABULARY<\/p> <p>In language we use the alphabet, in visualization there are basic forms to sketch representing people, places, actions or how time has lapsed. Having a larger visual vocabulary means not having to think about what you\u2019re drawing, but focusing on what you want to convey.<\/p> <p>2. PROCESS MAPPING<\/p> <p>When we\u2019re conveying ideas, the small concepts mentioned above add up to make a story. This story could tell how produce moves from the farm to our table or how cash flows through an organization. Understanding how to put the small pieces together to paint a grander picture is important for systems thinking and strategy.<\/p> <p>3. FRAMEWORKS<\/p> <p>Flowcharts, pyramid diagrams, bulls-eyes, journey maps\u2026there\u2019s no reason to reinvent the wheel when so many frameworks already exist. Having a good understanding of each type of visual framework and what it does will help you quickly express ideas for yourself and to your team.<\/p> <p>4. SUMMARIZING AND PRESENTING DATA<\/p> <p>As we start to build confidence in our visual vocabulary, mapping abilities, and have multiple frameworks to choose from, we can now start putting all of these components together. We\u2019ll integrate quantitative and qualitative data into our sketches to sell an idea that helps move an audience to action.<\/p> <p>IS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME?<\/p> <p>Regardless of your role in the organization, being able to clearly define your thoughts and ideas visually is a valuable skill.\u00a0In this one-day class, you\u2019ll take your visual skills to the next level with exercises to practice and tools you can use right away to build the confidence to draw out ideas.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE INTRUCTOR:\u00a0<\/p> <p>John Bloch is a visual facilitator, graphic recorder and art director with over 20\u00a0years experience working with companies and organizations including AT&amp;T,\u00a0Olympus, NYC Mayor\u2019s Office of Tech and Innovation, Price Waterhouse Coopers\u00a0and the Tribeca Film Institute. He has used his graphic facilitation and recording\u00a0skills to support conflict resolution, training workshops, hackathons, strategic\u00a0brainstorming and process development. John also taught concept drawing,\u00a0industrial and graphic design at Pratt Institute for 10 years.<\/p> <p>*We only allot 12 seats to this class for more personalized learning<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Design-Gym-New-York-City\/events\/227502281\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Sketching Bootcamp","id":"227502281","time":1453593600000,"updated":1453605822000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1413907282000,"name":"The Design Gym New York City","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":17769772,"urlname":"The-Design-Gym-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Community Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"21 East 1st Street","name":"The Alchemist's Kitchen Tonic Bar","lon":-73.991226,"id":24260690,"state":"NY","lat":40.724201,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.78748106956,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452724414000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Tonight's Wolf Moon event has been cancelled due to the snow storm.

Sorry, I do not enjoy walking slowly and I will not wait for stragglers.<\/p> <p><b>COST:<\/b>\u00a0$5 for the museum (reduced group rate), and $2 for me, in part to cover Meetup's organizer fee.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>LUNCH:<\/b> Bring your own or buy it at or near the lunch stop, a theater cafe that sells $8 sandwiches.\u00a0Lunch will be around 2 PM.<\/p> <p><b>ENDING TIME:<\/b>\u00a0Around 5 PM, but you can leave earlier, of course.<\/p> <p><b>TRANSPORTATION:<\/b>\u00a0C, E train to Spring St. (uptown only), or 1 train to Houston or Canal St. For details,\u00a0consult\u00a0mta.tripplanner.org, Google Transit (maps.google.com\/landing\/transit\/index.html) and\/or a subway map, since those sites do not always list the ideal routes.\u00a0Also check mta.info\/weekender for weekend service changes.<\/p> <p><b>WAITING LIST:\u00a0<\/b>Sign up and be patient. The list will shrink or disappear by the morning of the walk, due to cancellations and no-shows, especially at the last minute. As a courtesy to others waiting for a spot, please do not sign up unless you intend to go, rather than just as a placeholder in case nothing better turns up.
