All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

I think you'll be shocked.<\/p> <p>Here's are some of the high points of using Meteor:<\/p> <p>- You write code in one language (JavaScript) on your front end and back end<br\/>- You share code directly between your client and server by convention<br\/>- You have access to an incredible package repository - things like forms, data tables, charts, pagination and more literally take one line of code and a few seconds to add to custom applications<br\/>- Actions which may interest clients are automatically pushed to them - without you needing to manually wire up any web sockets<br\/>- You get a much improved REPL for interactive programming (Even LISPers will be impressed)<br\/>- The programming model supports a focus on packages and reusability<br\/>- It's still based on Node and Javascript, so you can still use NPM and bower packages, and deploy anywhere you can run Node<\/p> <p>How much can you get done in 4 hours? See you there. We'll have pizza, beer donations appreciated.<\/p> <p>We're going to do this at my apartment.

I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM THE INSTITUTE OF NOETIC SCIENCES FIVE DAY CONFERENCE ON THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES SUPPORTING THAT SPIRIT\/CONSCIOUSNESS IS PRIME IN THE UNIVERSE AND NOT MATTER, AND WE ARE IMMORTAL SOULS, AND I WILL SHARE THAT INFO IN MY PRESENTATION.<br\/>In addition I will give an introduction to my course, \u2018Beggars At God\u2019s Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\u201d My Course makes its unique contribution to this spiritual evolution in the following way: Creating Miracles Is A Three Step Process.<br\/>Step 1) In my 42 hour Course, I will show exactly how quantum physics came to the conclusion that \"mind\" is prime in the universe, and not matter, and, therefore, mind can transmute mater. I will then give the evidence showing how mind actually enters the cells of the body, even changing the DNA, and then we will see that applying quantum physics we will no longer see the body as a machine, but as an energy\/information body operating as a messaging system. And I will show the scientific evidence that optimal health and miraculous recovery is possible when the quantum energy\/information waves carrying the messages are not blocked, but are effectively transmitted.<br\/>Step 2) Yet, with all the scientific theory and evidence predicting miracles, we must ask why are physical healing miracles so rare. I will answer that question by showing the tricks our ego-mind (ie our usual mind) employs to keep us disempowered.<br\/>Step 3) Once we see the tricks of our ego-mind, we will see the need to go beyond our usual mind by giving our allegiance to spirit in order to be empowered. After we see our need for spirit, for the first time, we will have \"new eyes to see\" all the scientific evidence, and testimonials that are proof of spiritual power.<br\/>The combination of the scientific and testimonial evidence, and new eyes to see the evidence, because of a new allegiance to spirit, results in a \"certainty\" about the reality of spirit, that one will experience being spiritual power, and no longer just \"trying\" to get spiritual power. One will be in the blessed state of \"the peace that passeth understanding,\" and the focused mind, which has proven to be the foundation for healing miracles.<br\/>Bio:<br\/>Barry Harris worked at the Hippocrates Institute in Boston, writing health booklets for Dr. Ann Wigmore, discoverer of wheatgrass and founder of the live food movement. Hippocrates Institute is a unique healing center with a powerful spiritual focus, and an extreme dietary regime which often attracted clients who Western medicine had labeled terminally ill. While there Barry witnessed many miraculous recoveries. Later Barry witnessed more miracles while working for four years in various centers around the U.S. founded by Viktoras Kulvinskas, Dr. Wigmore's Director. Obsessed with the secret to miracles, Barry did 20 years of independent research connecting quantum physics (ie his college major) to Energy Medicine, cellular biology, mind\/body medicine, effect of emotions on health, etc.<br\/>Barry's research has been the source for the course \"Beggars At God's Banquet: Miracles Are Our Birthright\" which he has been presenting for the past nine years. Barry's book \"Beggars At God's Banquet\" based on the contents of the course will be published by X-Libris Publishing this fall or early winter.<br\/>Barry is also a singer\/voice teacher who teaches \"Voice as a Path of Spiritual and Emotional Healing.

With 20 published albums to his credit and his numerous appearances with other artists, KRS-One has literally written the most rhymes in Hip Hop\u2019s history. In the 1990s as \u201chip-hop\u201d grew more and more commercialized and corporate, it was KRS-One who openly rejected such cultural exploitation and grounded Hip Hop in its original principles of peace, love, unity and safely having fun. Teaching everything from self-creation to stopping violence; from vegetarianism to transcendental meditation, from the establishment of Hip Hop Appreciation Week (every third week in May), to establishing Hip Hop as an international culture at the United Nations (2001), KRS-One has single-handedly held the history and original arts of Hip Hop together now for over two decades.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transit:<\/b><\/p> <p>Red Line subway to Central Square Station<\/p> <p>or<\/p> <p>#1 Mass Ave bus to Central Square<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><\/p> <p>Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl\">Google<\/a> to arrange your driving directions.<\/p> <p><b>Parking:<\/b><\/p> <p>There are plenty of nearby metered parking spots in Municipal lots as well as the cheap ($3\/hour) Green Street Garage.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonOnyxbirds\/events\/224942669\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"KRS-One, \"Now Hear This\" Tour","id":"224942669","time":1444352400000,"updated":1444364400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1197747806000,"name":"Boston \"Onyxbirds\" Travel Group","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":877771,"urlname":"BostonOnyxbirds","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Onyxbirds"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":1,"headcount":0,"distance":1.23526775837,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":6,"created":1443028204000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>(This is not a Boston Azure, but cross-posting since this event should be of interest to many in our community.

This year\u2019s conference will be held in Boston, MA on October 9, 2015.<br\/>Asian American professionals and students from diverse industries and functions will gather from across the Northeast region of the US to network, learn and grow professionally. High-profile Asian executives will teach and inspire attendees during keynote addresses, workshops and panel discussions.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i><b>Conference Summary<\/b><\/i><br\/>With today\u2019s dynamic, fast-paced, and uncertain business environments, individuals, teams and organizations need to learn how to be agile and work nimbly to stay relevant. Companies that were once household names and dominated their industries, like Eastman Kodak and Motorola, are struggling to survive as they have failed to adapt to change. Others, like Amazon, Google and Apple, continue to reinvent themselves to stay ahead of evolving industry and customer demands. The willingness and capability to be agile and adapt to change has become one of the most critical success factors for managers and executives.<br\/>NAAAP Boston recognizes that agility has become an essential competency. Individuals and organizations must anticipate and work with change to capitalize on the opportunities it brings. The 2nd Annual Northeast Leadership Conference (NLC) hosted by NAAAP Boston will focus on the theme of \u201cAgility\u201d by providing individuals and organizations with the practical skills and actionable techniques to anticipate and adjust to the next challenge.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NAAAP-Boston\/events\/225425264\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":32400000,"name":"2nd Annual NAAAP Northeast Leadership Conference","id":"225425264","time":1444392000000,"updated":1444426099000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1363218800000,"name":"NAAAP Boston - Natl Assoc of Asian American Professionals","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":7608272,"urlname":"NAAAP-Boston","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02138","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1 Cambridge Center","name":"1CC","lon":-71.08535,"id":9466512,"state":"MA","lat":42.362583,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":120,"headcount":0,"distance":0.805574893951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433204798000,"fee":{"amount":50,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>8:00am Registration and Networking<\/p> <p>8:30am Event Start<\/p> <p>Abstract: Do you want to get certified on Azure?

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

The people. The conversation. It's like getting together with a few thousand of your closest friends and laughing, sometimes crying, and for sure to raise your vibration through the roof and set you up to have the best week ever.<\/p> <p>If this is your first Abraham workshop here's how it works: Esther Hicks takes the stage promptly at 9am. She explains the structure of the day (about 1 hour of Abraham and then a 20 minute break, rinse and repeat 2 more times), and explains how Abraham will select people to come up to the hot seat and ask a question.<\/p> <p>Then, she closes her eyes and gets still. Really still. When her eyes open it is Abraham looking out at us.<\/p> <p>If you want to get to the hot seat (I've been in it twice) get really clear, I mean really clear, about what you want to ask. Be at ease. Be confident. Be clear minded and focused. If you are unsure, you may be passed over. Or you may be called up and Abraham will give it their best to help you become unstuck. To drop the resistance you may be feeling. To empower you to be who you truly are - you are Source Energy! You are the energy that creates worlds focused here to be and do and have everything you desire!!<\/p> <p>If you don't get called up, don't worry. Your question will be answered one way or another.

Elevation Gain: 1150 feet Date: Saturday, October 10th, 2015 Location: 11:30am Flume Visitor Center North Parking lot. We will leave promptly at 11:45 so don't be late!<\/p> <p>Time for our Annual Fall Foliage hiking trip. This is a relatively easy hike and we've done this one before. You can use the bathrooms in the visitor center before and after the hike. Last time some people ended up taking the flume gorge tour by mistake instead of hiking. This hike is FREE and starts in the parking lot, so if you're in the visitor's center, and they ask you to pay, you're on the WRONG trail. Here are some excerpts from the AMC White Mountain Guide: This trail runs from the Flume Visitor Center parking area to the summit of Mt. Pemigewasset (Indian Head), where excellent views can be obtained with modest effort. Grades and footing are mostly easy. The trail reaches the vertical summit cliffs very abruptly, so care should be exercised. The trail follows the bike path north from the parking lot for 150 yd., turns left on a gravel path and passes under old US 3 in a tunnel, then turns left and crosses a brook on a bridge. It goes over a small rise, then turns sharp right and ascends under both lanes of the Franconia Notch Parkway. It enters the woods at .4 mi. and crosses several small brooks on log bridges, then turns right and then left along a small brook, climbing moderately. At 1.3 mi it squeezes around a large boulder and swings left uphill, climbing a bit more steeply to the ridgecrest, which it follows to the left (south). It passes the junction with the Indian Head trail on the right at 1.7 mi. and reaches the summit ledges at 1.8 mi. At the true summit which is just beyond the first ledges and a bit to the left there is a fine northeast view.<\/p> <p>Driving Directions I-93 to Exit 34A to the Flume Gorge Visitor's Center Parking lot. Driving time is approx. 2.5-3 hours from Boston without stops.<\/p> <p>Transportation is the responsibility of the individual.<\/p> <p>However, our members are good about offering carpools. Please note if you need a ride, what town you are coming from and\/or what T stop you can meet at. Same for those that can provide a ride. Since it is quite a bit of a drive we will have a carpool fee of $10 - payable to the driver.

Dr. Yung-Chi Sung M.A., Ph.D.<br\/>Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Yung-Chi grew up in a family of teachers. His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature. This may explain how and why he developed a mind that simultaneously admired arts and appreciated the sciences. Dr. Sung has a B.S. in Psychology from Soochow University in Taipei, , an M.A. in Linguistics (with a minor in Cognitive Science), an M.A. in Educational Psychology (with a minor in Psychology), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in Psychological Foundation, Learning, and Cognition, and a minor in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Psychology). He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students. He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative. From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives. Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015.

This meditation is done with specific OSHO Nataraj Meditation music, which indicates and energetically supports the different stages. The meditation lasts 65 minutes and consists of three stages. In the first part of the meditation, the participant is welcome to move freely, as his body desires. In the second part, the participant lies down, is silent and still. And the last part involves dancing in celebration. This is an individual experience moving with eyes closed throughout the entire meditation, so during the process the participant remains oblivious to others. It is helpful and wonderful to do it with other people in the room as the energy of the group supports the process and creates an atmosphere of love and awareness. After the meditation we will gather in a closing circle where participants will be able to share their experience or ask any questions if they wish to do so.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>The key benefits of the meditation are: finding inner flow, creating a unified body-mind and connecting to the inner source of bliss\u00a0<\/p> <p>The meditation will take place in Studio 2.<\/p> <p>It will run, provided that we have enough participants, every Sunday until December 13th with following exceptions: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0October 18th and Nov 8th<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-OSHO\/events\/225830889\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":5400000,"name":"Come and\/or leave with a celebrating heart!","id":"225830889","time":1444575600000,"updated":1444582644000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1443977911000,"name":"Boston OSHO Active Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":18994905,"urlname":"Boston-OSHO","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Celebrators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"for more details when you sign up ","name":"Central Sq","lon":0,"id":23939069,"state":"MA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.759144783,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443830742000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please check past event pics at:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/412224152314026\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/412224152314026\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/412224152314026\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\nWords with soul and lovely Chinese characters with spirit can inspire insight and add willpower in daily life.

Or are you like the Tin Man, prizing your heart? Researchers found that men in general, and Americans in particular, tend to locate themselves in the brain rather than the heart. Likewise, people made to think about being independent were more likely to locate themselves in the brain than people made to think about being dependent on others. And this belief can be a matter of life and death: Where you locate yourself biases your definition of death to be brain death or cardiac death, respectively. It also biases your support for an antiabortion law justified by the presence of a fetal heartbeat. Meanwhile, people who were made to locate themselves in the brain \u2014 by being asked to write about it \u2014 subsequently contributed more to an Alzheimer\u2019s charity than a heart disease charity.

Although pricier, it features 60+ feet toproping and lead climbing, a massive 22 x 140 foot bouldering wall (and there's still another upstairs), yoga &amp; fitness classes, a sauna, awesome water fountains that fill your water bottle, a retail store, lounge area, weight room, and a soon to open cafe! There's even a collaborative work space where you can study, work, and climb! \u00a0If you are looking for a partner, or just want to get your climb on, join us for a fun time.<\/p> <p>FAQ:<\/p> <p>How do I get there? BKBS is conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of the Porter Square station. Walk down Somerville Avenue and turn right on Properzi way and head all the way down. It is also very bike accessible. If you drive, you can find the lot at 30 Dane St. It is located next to Artisans Asylum.<\/p> <p>Why should I do this meetup? Since BKBS is such a new community (opened in late July 2013) few people have developed regular climbing partners to train and climb with. This is a great opportunity to meet other climbers interested in BKBS. Climbing is an inherently social sport - to toprope and do lead, you need to meet people who are dedicated to climbing. This meetup assures you'll meet a partner to climb with.<\/p> <p>What if I haven't climbed before? First off, don't be intimidated. Everyone started somewhere. If you have never belayed before, please make sure to take the Learn the Ropes class. More info can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bkbsomerville.com\/Classes\/<\/a>. If you have a working knowledge of how to belay, you will need to be belay certified before using the walls. Please flag down a BKBS employee and let them know you need to take a belay test. To pass such a test you will need to display how to tie a double figure eight knot with a fisherman's backup, safely belay a climber up a wall, catch them on a fall, and lower them to the ground safely.<\/p> <p>What equipment do I need? You will need at the bare minimum a harness and climbing shoes. Rentals are available. Grigri devices are provided at every station.<\/p> <p>What if I can come, but at a different time?

Guaranteed improvement for beginners and those with vocal problems.<\/p> <p>BIO:<\/p> <p>\u201cA person who has suffered vocal damage, but was able to repair it,<br\/>will probably be unusually qualified to teach vocal technique. The<br\/>discoveries he made in the course of his own recovery were priceless.<br\/>Since he went through the mill, he seems to be able to understand<br\/>and help others in a way nobody else could.\u201d From \u201cBuilding Your<br\/>Best Voice,\u201d by Henry Jacobi. Why is this so? Once you have weakened your vocal muscles, you must learn to sing perfectly, so there is absolutely NO muscle resistance, but your body is merely a vessel for vocal energy. Perfect singing is a combination of mastery of vocal technique and emotional release\/spiritual surrender. My background makes me uniquely qualified to teach perfect singing.. In the late 70s and early 80s, I sang in a number of musicals, and with several opera companies in New York City , before weakening my chords due to a combination of poor vocal training, and emotional blocks, which had been present since childhood. I was then extremely fortunate to study with Judy Oas, a world renown teacher, written up in \u201cOpera News.\u201d Judy's students had included both Metropolitan Opera and Broadway stars, but she had chosen to devote herself to exclusively helping promising students who had hurt their voice. She taught vocal rehabilitation, with a spiritual approach, calling her instruction, \u201cZen And the Art of Singing.\u201d Her unique dual focused approach was to teach vocal technique in a much more detailed manner than is usually the case, for vocal rehabilitation required perfect technique, while simultaneously exploring how the study of voice leads to a self-knowledge that, in effect, makes vocal training a kind of emotional and spiritual therapy. I have retained the same dual focus, but have expanded on her methods in both areas of vocal technique and spiritual\/emotional healing. In any case, I teach the foundations of vocal technique, that later can be applied to all types of singing, for good singing is good singing, whether it's blues, jazz, pop, classical, country, etc.<\/p> <p>COST FOR WORKSHOP: $60.

No one expects that everyone will be at the same level, and none of us mind slowing down or repeating what we have signed so that everyone understands.<\/p> <p>We all laugh WITH one another as we fumble along, mess things up, and start over again.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group.

Andersen's rigorous mapping of scene after scene onto the actual and imaginary Los Angeles is aided by frequent returns to the \"scenes of the crime\" of former film locations, via contemporary footage shot by Deborah Stratman. The film's arresting rhythm comes from Andersen's deft and mordant commentary (spoken by filmmaker Encke King), which remains almost conversational yet always imperious in its careful unveiling of those larger historical, cultural and ideological forces that render the cinematic city such a vivid palimpsest for ever-changing ideas of narrative and community. More than a corrective of cinema's faulty sense of place and history, however,\u00a0Los Angeles Plays Itself\u00a0powerfully uses rare counterexamples\u2014such as Kent MacKenzie's\u00a0The Exiles\u00a0(1961) and Billy Woodbury's\u00a0Bless Their Little Hearts\u00a0(1984)\u2014to argue that the indignities and false myths so frequently imposed upon Los Angeles by the cinema are direct expressions of actual injustice suffered by so many of its displaced, disenfranchised and, on the silver screen, silent inhabitants. With\u00a0Los Angeles Plays Itself, Andersen defined a distinct conception of film analysis: both a guerrilla repurposing of Hollywood films and a personally invested, politically charged yet equanimous mode of close reading that is able to decode an unruly multitude of major and minor films. The enduring cult status of\u00a0Los Angeles Plays Itself\u00a0was confirmed by the great excitement and acclaim that greeted its first official release in 2014, more than ten years after its Toronto premiere.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We can gather at Grafton Street Pub at 5:15 for fuel and discussion of Los Angeles and the work of Thom Andersen","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group\/events\/225826735\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Los Angeles Plays Itself","id":"225826735","time":1444604400000,"updated":1444621907000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1155954187000,"name":"Boston International\/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":307808,"urlname":"Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"people"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.51155936718,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442538210000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>October 11 - Uranus at Opposition.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during astronomical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:20 to 6:00 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225868673\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbqb","time":1444640400000,"updated":1444659186000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02188","country":"us","city":"Weymouth","address_1":"120 Main St","name":"120 Main St","lon":-70.955948,"id":11753902,"state":"Ma","lat":42.203526,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":12.3080720901,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444305832000,"fee":{"amount":125,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>October 12th \u00a0is a great time to visit Vermont to photograph the stunning foliage.<\/p> <p>Just a small group of four participants and one vehicle means we can vary the route to catch the best foliage. \u00a0We may end up as far north as Stowe or as far South as Woodstock depending on the location of Peak foliage.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In any event we will start in the vicinity of Cabot to photograph the scenery and the covered bridge in the photographs below.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe price of $125 includes instruction and transport.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/d\/c\/4\/600_442815812.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet at the Studio in Pembroke","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photoworks\/events\/225920001\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Fall Foliage trip to Vermont","id":"225920001","time":1444645800000,"updated":1444754938000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1269292505000,"name":"Photography Workshops","group_lon":-70.9599990845,"id":1618689,"urlname":"Photoworks","group_lat":42.2099990845,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"560 Washington Street","name":"Caff\u00e8 Nero","lon":-71.062393,"id":24101011,"state":"MA","lat":42.353603,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":0,"distance":0.589396238327,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444153099000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If your writing week goes better when you start early on Monday morning, join us at Caff\u00e8 Nero in Boston's Theater District, across from the Paramount Theater and close to Downtown Crossing and the Chinatown T-stops.<\/p> <p>I'll get there early and claim some space at the big wooden table by the windows, but sit wherever you're comfortable. \"Official\" Quite Write meetup time is 8:30 until 12:30, but drop in whenever you like!<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!<br\/>Diane<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/c\/600_442091132.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Quite-Write\/events\/225874320\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":14400000,"name":"Monday Morning Kick Start at Caff\u00e8 Nero","id":"225874320","time":1444653000000,"updated":1444669300000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1273520667000,"name":"Quite Write","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":1643406,"urlname":"Quite-Write","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Writers Who *Write*"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Your Computer","address_1":"The Internet","name":"ONLINE: http:\/\/www.boardgaming-online.com\/","lon":0,"id":23727217,"state":"UM","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.36717581749,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443798441000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Had a good season last time: the first time we tried five divisions, but everyone showed up and all games finished in a reasonable time.

It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

But every silver lining has a cloud, and Zach\u2019s comes when he learns that Hannah\u2019s mysterious dad is in fact R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the author of the bestselling Goosebumps series.

I'm looking to see if this can work to draw out some people in this Meet-up and will be cross-posting in another Meet-up too so we can get some really good participation. The basic idea is that we all bring some celestial object to share that we've found by our own observations of the night sky. I want to facilitate this but the intent will not be Jim entertaining you all with my vast knowledge of the night sky. (Even though it was said on more than one occasion that I took up \"space\" in college) You MUST participate \"actively\" by bringing one or more of the following three things; 1.) Binoculars, 2.) A Telescope, 3.) One or more celestial deep sky treasures that you've researched and can locate in the night sky to share with the group. I'll be bringing all three myself. I also have a pair of binoculars with a mounting that allows for people of all heights to see very well.

We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/225719066\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcytnbqb","time":1444692600000,"updated":1444737713000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02474","country":"us","city":"Arlington","phone":"781-316-0282","address_1":"369 Mass Ave","name":"The Arlington Center","lon":-71.14869,"id":684061,"state":"MA","lat":42.412078,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.40302991867,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441660607000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Exploring Mindful Self-Compassion with Kristy Arbon.

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869007\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbrb","time":1444726800000,"updated":1444739674000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01845","country":"us","city":"North Andover","address_1":"40 Bayfield Dr","name":"Ardito, Toscano & McCollum, PC","lon":-71.114838,"id":16598732,"state":"MA","lat":42.658985,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.8261203766,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432315788000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<i><b>Networking SMART<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>S<\/b>trategic <b>M<\/b>arketing <b>A<\/b>dvisory <b>R<\/b>eferral <b>T<\/b>eam<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are seeking committed, contributing members to join<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Networking-Smart\/155803897852209?ref=nf\">\u00a0<\/a><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>A Distinctively<\/b> <b>Different Networking Approach<\/b><\/p> <p>For New Business Development and Management<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our creative, resourceful networking process can help you<\/p> <p><b>Develop Significant Business Opportunities<\/b>!<\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Networking-Smart\/155803897852209?ref=nf\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>How is Networking\u00a0SMART \u201cDistinctively Different\u201d?<\/p> <p>\u00a0We are a cohesive group of accomplished professionals<\/p> <p>dedicated to contributing to the success of our members by providing:<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Dynamic, Interactive Meetings<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Actionable Business Generating Practices<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Business Advisory Assistance and Referrals<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 An Open, Shared, Mastermind and Mentoring Forum<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Results Driven Business Exchange and Discussions<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Expertise Shared by Invited Guest Speakers<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Social\/Professional Network Sharing and Integration<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Rewarding Activity and Commitment with Local Charitable Services<\/p> <p>-\u00a0 Convenient Time to Meet, 7:45 \u2013 9:00 AM\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you wish to augment your existing networking and referral efforts; or have found a less than satisfying experience with traditional <i>Networking<\/i> efforts; and interested to learn more about the <b>networking SMART;<\/b> approach, we invite you to our next meeting dedicated to your consideration as a potential new member.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

An elderly couple, Miguel and Dora, lives in isolation with little to say to each other. One day Miguel finds a lost, homeless young girl near the farm, and the couple decides to take her in a decision that upends their routine and relationship. It's a great little haunting film that keeps you intrigued to the end.

At the very center of the mall, there are water works and lots of huge tropical-looking plants. Stores nearby include Dior, Hugo Boss, and Williams Sonoma. There will be elevators on one side of the mall, across from BCBG Max Azria, and then escalators on the other. Take the elevators up to the \u201cSKYLOBBY\u201d. There will be someone at the security desk. They will need your ID. We will have provided a list of people to attend the event.<\/p> <p>When you get past security, go to \"4 Copley Place.\" Once inside those doors, get on an elevator and go up to the 7th floor. There will be a reception desk that will point you to the room that we will be in: \u201cBaluster \/ Cornice.\u201d If there\u2019s no one at the reception, then go past the reception desk and slightly to the left, where there will be two doors to a large room. That\u2019s where the class is held.<\/p> <p><i>Note: give yourself **PLENTY** of time to find our office, especially for the first class. I\u2019d say to give yourself a 15 minute cushion. Traffic around the area can be bad, and it takes a shockingly long time to navigate yourself around the mall. It will be all right if you get here early because we\u2019ll have TAs hanging around starting at 6:00<\/i>.<\/p> <p><b>Non-Mac users:<\/b><\/p> <p>As this class will be taught via Mac, it\u2019s important that you get to the first class 30 -40 minutes earlier so that you can set up your computer accordingly. We\u2019ll have instructions printed out and two TAs on hand in that time to help you set up.<\/p> <p><b>You need:<\/b><\/p> <p>1)\u00a0 Your laptop<\/p> <p>2)\u00a0 Your charger<\/p> <p>3)\u00a0 To eat beforehand \/ bring food with you<\/p> <p><b>Bathrooms:<\/b><\/p> <p>When you exit the room, walk straight past the reception desk, and then hang a right.

There are certainly some exciting opportunities in \u201cjust-in-time\u201d behavioral measurement and intervention technologies enabled by these technologies. There are also, however, some major hurdles to overcome to prove that these new ideas lead to meaningful improvements in health. Part of the challenge is that short-term behavior change may be relatively easy, but maintaining behavior change is fundamentally difficult for most people to do. To address this, transdisciplinary teams of technologists and behavioral scientists must work together to deploy prototype technologies in \u201cmessy,\u201d real-world settings for relatively long periods of time. I will discuss some of my group\u2019s experiences building and deploying systems for measuring or motivating behavior change, with special focus on an app for weight loss, and use them to frame some challenges practitioners designing interfaces for health technologies may want to consider going forward.<\/p> <p>Bio<br\/>Stephen Intille, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science and Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University. His research focuses on the development of novel healthcare technologies that incorporate ideas from ubiquitous computing, user-interface design, pattern recognition, behavioral science, and preventive medicine. Areas of special interest include technologies for measuring and motivating health-related behaviors, technologies that support healthy aging and well-being in the home setting, and mobile technologies that permit longitudinal measurement of health behaviors for research, especially the type, duration, intensity, and location of physical activity.<br\/>For more on Stephen Intille see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccs.neu.edu\/home\/intille\/cv-web\/bio.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.ccs.neu.edu\/home\/intille\/cv-web\/bio.htm<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Evening Schedule<br\/>6:30 \u2013 7:00 Networking over pizza and beverages<br\/>7:00 \u2013 8:30 Meeting<br\/>8:30 \u2013 9:00 CHI Dessert and more networking!<\/p> <p>Sponsors<br\/>IBM Research is hosting us and providing food.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Wearable-technologies-in-Boston\/events\/225744752\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":" Measuring & Motivating Health Behavior Change Using Mobile Technology","id":"225744752","time":1444775400000,"updated":1444787940000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369244587000,"name":"Wearable technology in Boston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":8598322,"urlname":"Wearable-technologies-in-Boston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Wearable techies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861220598221,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1324425033000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Available public transportation:<\/p> <p>1.

Here is a map of the area.<\/p> <p>By Subway: Take the Orange Line to Wellington. Walk over the skybridge and cross through the parking lot. Upon exiting the garage, you'll see a building complex (SL75) across the street. Cross the street and take a right. Follow around this building and you'll find Not Your Average Joe's on the opposite side of the street.<\/p> <p>By Car: If you are driving, be aware that Station Landing is at the intersection of Rt. 16 and Rt. 28, and you can enter the Station Landing complex from the north-bound side of Rt. 28, or the east-bound side of Rt. 16. There are a number of stores in the Station Landing complex -- look for the Margarita's, Starbucks or Not Your Average Joe's signs. NYAJ is located right off of Rte. 28. Although there is free parking all around the building, we recommend that C&amp;C members park in the garage underneath the restaurant.<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonCards\/events\/225662245\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"LETTER and NUMBER TILE NIGHT","id":"225662245","time":1444775400000,"updated":1445086309000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242951504000,"name":"C&C (Boston Cards and Conversation)","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":1460145,"urlname":"BostonCards","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Social Gamers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Boston","address_1":"1626 Tremont St","name":"TGI Friday's","lon":-71.104691,"id":23932256,"lat":42.333679,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":6,"distance":2.54418110847,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443029626000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/3\/8\/e\/highres_100130062.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come join Richard and friends for a night of\u00a0Magic: The Gathering\u00a0over at\u00a0TGIFridays\u00a0in Boston.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen. We will have first aid available, but make sure you are thinking clearly and in your limits before training!\u00a0<\/p> <p>I am available to answer all questions, but I hope to see a whole bunch of you out in a few weeks!!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Be sure to check us out on:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ParkourAndTricking<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\"><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/instagram.com\/projectfreerun<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.projectfreerun.com\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/3\/7\/5\/600_437965461.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Baby Pool is located within the Charlestown Navy Yard, and within a brick facade wall.

Our Lady appeared many times. She promised that she will perform a miracle. On October 13, 1917, she fulfilled her promise to a crowd of more than 70,000 people. They witnessed the Miracle of the Sun. A replica of the Miracle is embedded on the wall of the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Boston, MA. The message was not only for the children. It is also for the world. It was for this reason that the Crusaders of Fatima came into existence in Boston. It was in 1957 that the First Saturday Group started the First Saturday Devotion. The devotion has a Mass at 9:00 AM followed by the rosary at 10 AM. A Candlelight Procession is also celebrated on the 13th of the months from May to October. The Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Brighton was made to provide the people a place to pray. Today the Shrine is open from 10:00 AM-6:00 PM everyday Monday to Sunday. Rosary for World Peace is said every Sunday at 3:00 PM. There were many men and women of hope who made the Shrine available for us. They knew the Message of Peace and the importance thereof in the future. They believed that we will need a place such as the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima. The message of Our Lady of Fatima\u2026 \u201cI am the Lady of the Rosary\u2026When my Immaculate Heart triumphs\u2026Then, there will be Peace.\u201d May 13, 2017 will be the 100th anniversary of Our Lady of Fatima Apparition. Let us start the preparation for the Celebration. Join us to continue to pray for peace in each of our own families, peace in our communities, peace in our country,\u00a0and peace in our World.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Monastic-Cooking-Club\/events\/225652988\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Candle Light Procession Our Lady of Fatima Shrine in Brighton, Massachusetts 8PM","id":"225652988","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444791757000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369842109000,"name":"Monastic Cooking Club","group_lon":-71.1200027466,"id":8693452,"urlname":"Monastic-Cooking-Club","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Cooks and Servants"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01970","country":"us","city":"Salem","address_1":"254 Essex Street, Suite 204","name":"Essence of Healing","lon":-70.896767,"id":12620772,"state":"MA","lat":42.521461,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.258310318,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443571677000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Essence of Healing is excited to present teacher and speaker<\/p> <p>CAROL DEARBORN for a FREE talk about:<\/p> <p>YOUR BODY, YOUR WELL BEING, YOUR LIFE!<\/p> <p>Tuesday October 13th 7:30pm<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How can we understand the seeming opposites of Western (or Northern, if you prefer) medicine and the truth of energetic healing?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How much of what your Western doctor says is your real prognosis?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How can you be true to your path as a healer, intuitive, and explorer of this vast region, while also giving and receiving tangible help?<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Do health, healing, and wellness have to be a solitary journey?<\/p> <p>Carol will answer all these as she discusses with you her stroke \u2013 from a Western and then from a seemingly opposite energy or shamanic viewpoint.\u00a0 Which is correct?\u00a0 Which, or how much of each, should we use?\u00a0 How can we understand ad utilize science verses the utterly unscientific, yet true and valuable, energetic perspective?\u00a0 Is Integrated Medicine as far as we\u2019ll go?\u00a0 What changes \u2013 physical, emotional, and spiritual \u2013 can you expect as you delve into the mysteries of this quest?\u00a0 Above all, how will you use this wild and precious life when your wellbeing and your vehicle are changing?<\/p> <p>Please join teacher and speaker Carol Dearborn as she discusses her own stoke and her journey into a deeper understanding of these and many other issues.\u00a0 There will be ample time for questions and discussion of this vital topic.<\/p> <p>This is a FREE event but please RSVP!<\/p> <p>Carol Dearborn is an initiated shaman in the Peruvian Inca tradition, a visual artist, President Emeritus of the Sufficiency Foundation, and Reiki Master Teach.\u00a0 She is also a member of the Executive Board of the Andean Research Institute and has more than 30 years\u2019 experience teaching many forms of energetic healing.\u00a0 Her mission is to help awaken modern cultures to our freedom and responsibility to create a sustainable presence on Earth through the evolution of human consciousness and particularly our connection to the sacred in all forms. \u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.essencehealing.net\">www.essencehealing.net<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development\/events\/225713032\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Your Body, Your Well Being, Your Life a FREE talk with Carol Dearborn","id":"225713032","time":1444779000000,"updated":1444793019000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328926286000,"name":"Salem's Healing & Spiritual Development","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":3273062,"urlname":"Salems-Healing-and-Spiritual-Development","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Spiritual Beings"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.861012935638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441156512000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of the Manga Club!

A part of me was tempted to suggest a certain title that violates the laws of physics while killing zombies, but I decided that would be too easy. Besides, other than questioning what was in the local drinking water, I couldn\u2019t think of too many discussion questions for that series. Therefore, I decided that it was time to break out something newer and more exciting!

But little does he know...his new class has a horrible secret. When he takes his seat in class for the first day of school, Koichi is unsettled by his fearful classmates. Despite this atmosphere and warnings from fellow students, Koichi is drawn to the beautiful, distant Mei Misaki, another classmate. But the closer he tries to get to her, the more mysterious she and their class become. And when a fellow student dies a disturbing death - the first of a long chain of deaths - Koichi seeks to learn the truth behind the curse of Class 3-3. But can he get answers before the curse kills him? <\/i><\/p> <p>I have placed an order for some copies at the venue, and don\u2019t forget our special deal!

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869010\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbsb","time":1444813200000,"updated":1444826162000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"01852","country":"us","city":"Lowell","address_1":"300 Martin Luther King Jr Way","name":"Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell","lon":-71.313225,"id":13331082,"state":"MA","lat":42.649769,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5923786163,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1392657020000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Proceed to the second level of the Tsongas Arena and head left across the concourse toward the Talon Club.

She is not a humanist, and we can't and don't promise to agree with her on every topic discussed at this brown bag lunch session.<\/p> <p>However, we are happy to draw our community's attention to Williamson's latest essay, \"American Revolution 2.0,\" an entirely secular call to save American democracy before it is too late. This idea of a new American revolution will be the topic of our conversation: is it an idea around which spiritual and secular communities can unite?

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

We will be focusing more on learning how to move our body, understand our limits and get a solid understanding of how to train safe rather than jumping straight into super-high level flips and jumps.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What if I'm a gymnast\/marine\/stuntman\/etc? I don't want to be bored.<\/b><\/p> <p>Our program prides itself on scaling classes to each and every student. With something like Parkour there are many levels and progressions to each movement. It's very common to in the same class have one student working on perfecting their roll, and on the other side of the room have another student practicing very high-level acrobatics. They both come from the same foundation, but are scaled to each practitioners skill level.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What do I need to bring\/prepare?<\/b><\/p> <p>The great thing about Parkour is its accessibility. You really only need a good pair of shoes. We recommend a shoe that is made for urban running (no aggressive treads, a smoother sole lightweight). Think hiking boots, crocs, skate shoes are all no-nos.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Other than that, dress appropriately for activity. Shorts, sweats, t-shirts are all good here. Jeans are normally not the best choice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We highly recommend bringing water, snacks and a form of transportation (bike, longboard, potentially train fare)<\/p> <p>We will be charging a $5 per class fee to start here, and for the 1 hour 15 minute class we think this isn't too ridiculous. We accept cash or card day of.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p> <p>These jams will be run outdoors, and with existing architecture. While we won't be getting into anything crazy, injuries are to be expected. Scrapes happen.

Ok - but what is it? [<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/susi-remondi\/b\/415\/254\">Susan Redmondi<\/a>]<br\/>OAuth is pretty ubiquitous in security. It's dual purpose: Out in the digital world, there are a lot of resources that we might want to share access to where an all-access pass just won't cut it (think: all those permissions Facebook games ask for), and, more generally, it protects REST APIs. We'll start with an introduction to OAuth (assuming zero knowledge), talk about some use cases, and look at some code a developer would need to put together to talk to companies like PayPal, Facebook, or Google. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>(speech level: intermediate; duration: 25\u00a0minutes) \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Networking Session 2\u00a0- DJ Mix 2\u00a0- Food &amp; Drink\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Who owns software security?

So why do we continue to see the same software security mistakes made again and again? We have the answers! And this talk will show how you, the developer, are the solution.

There are no \"tickets\" but we would like a head count in order to prepare a big enough space for sitting together.<\/p> <p>Note: we typically have up to 30 people attend these events. RSVPing is pretty important because we need to move bookcases around to fit everybody in the space. Thanks! Seating:<br\/>If you have hip\/knee or other reasons to need a chair, make sure to rsvp here and say 'reserve a chair' in your comments.<br\/>There are seven folding chairs and a few low stools. Zafu style cushions are sometimes available if the store has some in stock. But there are no guarantees. Most of us will be sitting on the floor. Feel free to bring your own pillow with you. What is planned:<br\/>The hour (or so) that we spend together will include: discussion about compassionate healing for ourselves and each other, and an experience of lovingkindness meditation. The length of the meditation itself will probably be about 15 to 20 minutes long. No previous experience is required, the meditation will be easy for beginners to understand.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MindfulBoston\/events\/225126959\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":4500000,"name":"Community Meditation Night- LovingKindness","id":"225126959","time":1444862700000,"updated":1444918992000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1312499079000,"name":"MindfulBoston","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":2292291,"urlname":"MindfulBoston","group_lat":42.3699989319,"who":"Meditation Students"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"North Andover","address_1":"Walsh way","name":"Rogers center for the Arts at Merrimack College","lon":-71.122116,"id":24077269,"lat":42.667896,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":21.4821853638,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444211759000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>TAMBAKOS FILM SERIES: October 14<\/p> <p>\"THE LODGER\" \/Silent<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/e\/b\/600_441635051.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>COST: Free<\/p> <p>TIME: The Silent Film starts @ 7:00 pm ( running time: 68 min)<\/p> <p>*LIVE MUSIC by Jeff Rapsis<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/c\/3\/600_441635011.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>ABOUT THE FILM: 1927- Directed by ( very young Alfred Hitchcock) Starring: Marie Ault, Arthur Chesney, June, Malcolm Keen, Ivor Novello.

A lifelong silent film fan, he began creating original musical scores and staging silent film programs in 2007 as a way to keep the form before the public. His technique is to create a set of original music in advance for each film, and then improvise a score based on this material as the screening takes place. Outside New England, he has accompanied films at the New York Public Library\u2019s \u201cMeet the Musicmakers\u201d series and the Kansas Silent Film Festival. Rapsis has also provided original music for several silent film DVD releases by Looser Than Loose Vintage Entertainment of Manchester, N.H., and scored the independent feature film Dangerous Crosswinds (2005).<br\/>FREE EVENT<br\/>Liability Release - AS A CONDITION OF ATTENDING THIS MEETUP EVENT, YOU AGREE TO hold harmless, and indemnify the organizer and her heirs, and all members and participants of this Meetup group from any and all claims for injury, illness, death, and\/or property damage including those caused by negligence, ignorance, inexperience and other reasons.

Discover the joy of dancing in a totally non-judgmental atmosphere, where anything safe and respectful goes... dance by yourself, in a group, with a same or opposite sex partner, or even just chat and enjoy watching.<\/p> <p>First time visitors are welcomed heartily, and get in for half price! Otherwise, you decide what to pay in a range from $10 to $20, or less later in the evening as the event nears its end (information on late admission discounts is at the door). Our friendly dancers range from utterly new at it to very skilled dancers in funk, rock, salsa, modern, jazz, hip-hop, African &amp; Latin and swing, tango, contact improvisation, and our own unique spontaneous creations! Dance with or alongside amazing dancers from local dance troupes as well as with ordinary good-hearted rug cutters. At work they may be doctors, lawyers, programmers, massage therapists, expressive therapists, artists, students, dog walkers, scientists, or anything else, but at heart they all love to dance.<\/p> <p>The music runs the gamut: funk, world music, soul &amp; r&amp;b, house, trance, hip-hop, salsa, yoga music, jazz or swing, reggae, disco, you name it! Each DJ from our rotating list has a unique style, but we try to include something for everyone in every set. We keep a good balance in the music: familiar with unusual, timeless with current, melodic with drum-based, and positive lyrics with instrumentals--in all kinds of rhythms &amp; styles! In any given evening, the world music parts of our dance are likely to include at least 3 or so of the following... African, Latin, Indian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean, zydeco, gypsy and much more. You'll hear everything from basic party music to very danceable songs with socially conscious lyrics, but you won't be hearing anything sexist, racist, violent, hating or otherwise divisive.<\/p> <p>Start with a soothing stretch and warm up at 7:30, connect with the group and start to boogie at 7:50 with our first DJ of the evening, take a brief break at 8:50 for community announcements and a short unique performance or workshop (or chatting &amp; stretching in a way that doesn't interfere), then cut the rug again by 9:15 at the latest with the evening's second DJ, till 10:30--plenty of time for a great workout and some feel-good inspiration and respiration and perspiration!<\/p> <p>At the beginning of each half of the evening's music, everyone who wants to gathers around a centerpiece to hold hands, and dance in a winding chain together to a song with uplifting, connective (or at least beautiful and hypnotic) slow to medium tempo rhythms. (This dance was created from out of a drumming circle on the Cambridge Common in the sixties, after all, and some of that great political and community spirit still lives on here.) Then, it's all dance music, generally building in tempo to a crescendo, slowing down again for some more melodic and slow dance songs for a few minutes, then gradually building to a second crescendo. The second half of the evening's dance follows roughly the same pattern with a different DJ and style, and ends with another circle dance for those who enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Dancers are always welcome to help with set-up or take-down, and get in free for doing so! It's a great chance to get to know the community better and be serviceful, as well as to save money and help us to be around for another 42 years... Welcome!

Images need to be taken during this event period, old photos don't count. Are you a morning person? Good, the best time to do this is 12-24 October before dawn.<\/p> <p><b>Zodiacal light<\/b> is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the sun along the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ecliptic\">ecliptic<\/a> (the apparent path that the sun takes across our sky). It is best seen just after sunset in spring, and just before sunrise in autumn, when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interplanetary_medium\">&lt;\/a&gt;in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible. That means: shooting over the ocean on the beach gets you best results, but you will need a clear night without much marine layer fog.<\/p> <p><br\/>In the northern hemisphere, the light appears as a faint cone of light above the eastern horizon before sunrise (or the western horizon in spring). Its light intensity is greater than the Milky Way. Typically, the light is colorless, but in rare circumstances it can have blue, green, yellow, or red hues. If the conditions are right, it is easy to see the zodiacal light, but because it is so faint and occurs near the horizon, most viewers think they are seeing twilight or the light from a distant town (both of which we eliminate by shooting before civil twilight and over the ocean). It is best seen when the sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon, that means during nautical twilight.<\/p> <p><br\/>The best time then is 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. during the period 12-24 October, after that it gets too bright (sunrise is around 7, in case you want to capture, that, too). Even though the light can be seen well in general in October and November, the moon will be out of the way only during that period of 12-24 Oct (and again 11-23 November). If you have PhotoPills (iToy) or PlanIt! (Android), these apps can show you exactly where the sun would come up, that is where you have to point your camera - typically due East (90\u00b0) to about 100\u00b0.<\/p> <p><br\/>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiacal_light\"&gt;Here is more info about it on Wikipedia<\/a><\/p> <p>and<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.tw\/search?q=Zodiacal+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI9KOJoeStyAIVyZeUCh2qpgJL#imgrc=_\">some examples on Google<\/a><\/p> <p>.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/d\/e\/4\/600_442764036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Shooting settings are the same as for star points or Milky Way: wide open aperture (f\/2.8 or wider), maximum exposure time in seconds is determined as 400\/focal length in mm (300\/FL for cropped sensor cameras) and ISO between 1600 and 3200 (6400 is usually too noisy and diminishes the beauty of the faint light). Compose to have something interesting in your foreground, could be silhouettes, as long as it is not a plain straight beach. Try some dunes, or if you plan to go into the mountains, that works, too.<\/p> <p><br\/>Useless trivia: Brian May, guitarist of the rock band Queen moonlighted (!) as a scientist and completed a PhD thesis on <i>A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud<\/i>.<\/p> <p><br\/>Post pictures here as you get them.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is not a group event, it is an individual challenge","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GBNight\/events\/225869013\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Challenge: Capture the Zodiacal Light","id":"cjkhllytnbtb","time":1444899600000,"updated":1444912110000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1379715337000,"name":"Greater Boston Night Photographers","group_lon":-71.4599990845,"id":10355952,"urlname":"GBNight","group_lat":42.25,"who":"Night Owls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":12.3277387619,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433462918000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We are a professional business networking group with 13 members based in Burlington, MA.

The diversity in data platforms, BI tools, user needs and vendor stories is dizzying.

Together, we will design your world class data organization and team including:<br\/>\u2022 Setting organizational and team values<br\/>\u2022 Defining your scope of practice and capabilities<br\/>\u2022 Planning for a strong relationship between company strategy and your team<br\/>\u2022 Creating world class processes<br\/>\u2022 Building your world class execution plan<br\/>\u2022 Systems for turning data technologists into organizational leaders<\/p> <p>Management and technologists will enjoy this session together.

All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

In 1993 he took a job as a junior copywriter at Arnold, a high-profile Boston ad agency owned and run by his father, Ed Eskandarian, a prominent figure in the advertising world. There Chris used the principles of branding and marketing along with his ever-present sense of humor to rebrand himself and orchestrate what was quite possibly the most widely accepted and embraced gender transition of its kind \u2013 at a time when the word transgender didn\u2019t exist. All while building an award-winning advertising career spanning nearly twenty years. His best-known creative projects include the infamous McDonald\u2019s singing fish (\u201cGimme back that Filet-O-Fish, gimme that fish\u201d) and the YouTube McNuggets rapper guys (\u201cI\u2019m into Nuggets y\u2019all\u201d), both of which went viral and infiltrated pop culture. He was also part of the creative team on Truth, the long-running campaign targeting Big Tobacco, which was recently ranked one of the top 15 ad campaigns of the 21st century.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For more on Chris\u2019 book project and a link to his full creative portfolio, check out<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisedwardsballs.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.chrisedwardsballs.com<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Digital-rendezvous\/events\/224706658\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"name":"Digital Rendezvous with Chris Edwards","id":"224706658","time":1444944600000,"updated":1444956389000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1323722198000,"name":"Digital Rendezvous","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":2940612,"urlname":"Digital-rendezvous","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Creative Talent"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":16.7424526215,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443398816000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Meet me afterwork to ride cutler park.

Using the Meetup scheduling system alone without intervention would mean that the third Thursday will be on expiration week except for those months starting on a Friday, as is the case in August of 2014; in which case, the meeting would fall a week after the monthly expiry week. We believe that we will be able to successfully manipulate this consideration in the meetup system to keep the meetings all on the Thursday evening before expiration Friday. If you see a meeting time that isn't the Thursday evening before expiration Friday, please let us know and we will correct it. Thank you.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet in the study room on the middle floor on the parking lot side of the building.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BostonTraders\/events\/225456081\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Options Monthly Meeting for Boston Traders Meetup","id":"qtfntjytnbtb","time":1444946400000,"updated":1444954859000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1201548457000,"name":"Boston Traders Meetup to Teach\/Learn Trading Strategies","group_lon":-71.0500030518,"id":981165,"urlname":"BostonTraders","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Traders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"255 Main Street","name":"Microsoft Technology Center (MTC)","lon":-71.084969,"id":24019912,"state":"MA","lat":42.362373,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.783356487751,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439262571000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>IMPORTANT: \u00a0ALL ATTENDEES PURCHASE TICKETS VIA EVENTBRITE<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ui-for-games-tickets-18083121102\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ui-for-games-tickets-18083121102\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ui-for-games-tickets-18083121102<\/a><\/a><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/c\/f\/600_438549167.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Class: UI for Games<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Thursday, October 15, 2015 @ 6:00 PM<br\/>Microsoft Technology Center (MTC)<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ui-for-games-tickets-18083121102\">Register Here!<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/ui-for-games-tickets-18083121102\">Eventbrite<\/a>\u00a0to see the class description, lesson plan, and to purchase a ticket.<\/p> <p>Seats are limited.\u00a0<\/p> <p>------<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/6\/3\/8\/600_440773880.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/boston-games\/events\/224550543\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Class: UI for Games","id":"224550543","time":1444946400000,"updated":1444957989000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1380855137000,"name":"Playcrafting Boston Meetup","group_lon":-71.0400009155,"id":10544392,"urlname":"boston-games","group_lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"02140","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"1815 Massachusetts Avenue","name":"Bourbon Coffee","lon":-71.118988,"id":13000962,"state":"MA","lat":42.387077,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":3.12956309319,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443129578000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ABOUT THE WORKSHOP: Now in its 14th year, the weekly Boston Poetry workshop (formerly \u201cCharles River Writers\u201d) has always been an open forum for literary fellowship and discussion.<\/p> <p>To participate, please RSVP here, and arrive bearing enough copies of the text you\u2019d like to discuss \u2013 whether prose or verse \u2013 for each participant to have their own.

Since the list is getting large we have started selecting a rotating list of about ten tunes a month that we will definitely play so that new members can have a chance to play along without learning every tune right away. I update this list and email it monthly.<\/p> <p>This is still a new group, and how we go about learning and playing is still a work in progress. But the goal is to have fun, and to get together with others who enjoy playing Irish music. Musicians of all levels are welcome. Since the goal here is for everyone to play, new members are encouraged to suggest tunes from the list and to suggest tunes to add to it. If the group as a whole knows a tune well, we'll play it slowly a couple of times, and then pick the tempo up a bit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Note on tempo<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have gone to a typical Irish Session, we play a little faster than half that speed. But we'll start tunes slowly enough that everyone should be able to play along and learn by ear.\u00a0If you haven't been to a session it is best to just show up and see if the tempo suits you :) \u00a0If you like metronomes... \u00a0For Reels (4\/4), Hornpipes (4\/4) and Polkas (2\/4) set the metronome from 100 to 140 BPM and play one quarter note per click. For Double Jigs (6\/8), Slip Jigs (9\/8), and Single Jigs (12\/8) set the metronome from 65 to 95 BPM and play three eighth notes per click.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions<\/b><\/p> <p><b>By Subway<\/b><\/p> <p>The closest Red Line stop is Davis Square. From Davis Square you can either walk Northwest on Holland Street or take the bus (the 87 or the 88) to Teele Square. It is about a 10 minute walk between Davis and Teele Square.\u00a0You can recognize Teele Square as a 5-way intersection with a small triangular island having a sign that says Teele Square. From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.<\/p> <p><b>By Bus<\/b><\/p> <p>The 87, 88, and 89 buses stop in Teele Square. \u00a0The 87 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and Arlington Center.\u00a0The 88 bus runs between Lechmere Station (Green Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway.\u00a0The 89 bus runs between Sullivan Square (Orange Line) and the Clarendon Hill Busway. You'll want to get off the bus in Teele Square.\u00a0From Teele Square walk North on Curtiss Street for 3 blocks to Powder House Boulevard. The church is on the NE corner of the intersection.\u00a0The 77 bus runs between Harvard and Arlington Heights. You can walk from Mass Ave to Teele Square.<\/p> <p><b>By Car<\/b><\/p> <p>There is parking behind the West Somerville School that is one block West of the church. Parking there is available after 5PM even though the signs are somewhat ambiguous. From Powderhouse, turn onto Curtis, heading up the hill toward Tufts. Take the first left turn from Curtis onto Raymond Street. Ignore the NO LEFT TURN sign, as it is only in effect during rush hours. Raymond runs behind the school. The lot is about half a block down Raymond on the left.<\/p> <p>Street parking is also available one block away on Packard Avenue from Powderhouse Blvd on the hill to the Tufts University campus.

Among these events are Observatory Nights held on the third Thursday of the month (excluding June, July and August). Observatory Nights feature a nontechnical lecture and telescopic observing from the observatory roof if weather permits. The lectures are intended for high-school age and older audiences but children are also welcome. We also sponsor a variety of other special observing events throughout the year. No reservations are necessary, but seating is limited to the auditorium's capacity. Admission is free.<\/p> <p>These events--unless otherwise noted--are held in Phillips Auditorium (at the rear of the CfA complex near Madison Street and large parking lot), 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, about 1 mile west of Harvard Square.

Yet the same harsh conditions that make survival so challenging also make the South Pole an ideal location for astronomy. From here, scientists are studying the faint glow of the Big Bang known as the cosmic microwave background. Their goal is nothing less than to tease out the subtle signs of cosmic inflation and open a window onto the birth of the universe. After a roller-coaster ride of discovery and setback, the quest continues. At the helm: John Kovac, who has traveled to the South Pole more than 20 times in his career. John Kovac is an associate professor of astronomy at Harvard and leader of the BICEP2 Collaboration.<\/p> <p>For more information, including accessibility, or to sign up for the events mailing list, call the Public Affairs Office, (617)[masked] or email [masked]. Please request sign-language interpretation at least 2 weeks before the event. Current sky information is available.
