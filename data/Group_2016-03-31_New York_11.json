Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses.

This wonderful, powerful healing modality is practiced by a fairly decent number of healers in the U.S., but it seems not yet strongly represented on the East Coast. We, the organizers (Sharon and Louisa) are very passionate about Angelic Reiki and feel that Spirit is pushing us to spread the word, so that in a few years' time, Angelic Reiki will be well known to the metaphysical community. We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!! This is about spreading more Angelic love and influence.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":188293811,"name":"Sharonel69","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/highres_252226451.jpeg","photo_id":252226451,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/member_252226451.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/thumb_252226451.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"Angelic Reiki Healing Meetup","id":18673371,"state":"NY","urlname":"Angelic-Reiki-Healing-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Woodbridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434339624000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Woodbridge-Walkers-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for anyone who is looking for walking buddies!

Early Russian cosmists proposed the idea of technological decompaction\/lightweighting of human body, which eventually wouldn\u2019t need an atmosphere and will be powered directly by solar energy. They call it \u201cradiant humanity\u201d - perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. <\/p> \n<p>Modern Cosmism brining to this doctrine ontological foundation, scientific structure and comprehension of possible technology. It's suggested that the profound nature of the reality is digital and it utilizes&nbsp; existential source code coming from Being which are using \u201cradiant humanity\u201d for its preserving and modification.&nbsp; Thus, we consider (for example) that Cosmological constant and precondition of Big Bang singularity were informationaly favorable mean guided. <\/p> \n<p>Cosmism will \u201cwork closely together\u201d with Transhumanism&nbsp; on transition period until consciousness uploading&nbsp; become possible. Then most likely humanity will be divided in two main directions: Earth base genetically improved biological civilization and departing digital society, creating new cosmic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/highres_439015680.jpeg","photo_id":439015680,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/600_439015680.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/thumb_439015680.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176456192,"name":"Vlad Bowen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/highres_245249871.jpeg","photo_id":245249871,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/member_245249871.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/thumb_245249871.jpeg"}},"members":82,"name":"Cosmism Meetup","id":18678518,"state":"NY","urlname":"Cosmism-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434549197000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"retire","name":"Retirement Planning","id":10026},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"financial-planning","name":"Financial Planning","id":15222},{"urlkey":"money","name":"Money","id":15580},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"retirees","name":"Retirees","id":20689},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"retired-men-and-women","name":"Retired Men and Women","id":49065}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wealth-Builders\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Welcome to New York Wealth Builder!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Are you worried that you will never achieve financial independence?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you spend more time planning your next vacation instead of your financial future?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Does thinking about your financial future cause you anxiety?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you look at your parents and tell yourself you better start planning now?&nbsp; <\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Most people do, which is why I wrote How to Avoid Bag Lady Syndrome: A Strong Woman's Guide to Financial Peace of Mind to help individuals achieve financial independence and take control of their financial world at an earlier stage in life.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>We plan to meet once a month to discuss any financial concerns or matters that are important to the group as a whole.

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

While sitting at a table at the bar I overheard the friend talking about his girlfriend saying \"Girls just can't understand finance.\" Of course I chimed in and said WTF?! are you joking me?? OBVI if i had studied finance in college, then I would be sick at finance.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, after this conversation, I realized that I would like to learn more about this predominantly male-driven field that our entire society is so dependent on.

BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

When we were evolved from Amoeba to humans, we were not aware of it. In order to evolve from human beings to pure joy and pure spirits, the all-pervading power wants us to realize the transformation. The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1.

In fact, since 1985, BNI members worldwide have exchanged over 15 Million business referrals, totaling over $8 Billion in new business.  In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business. ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Networking requires commitment. The most successful chapters of BNI are comprised of participants who are sincerely committed to helping one another through networking. They are a team. As a participant in BNI, you are responsible for complying with the policies and guidelines of the organization.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13744230,"name":"Joe Vaccarelli","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/highres_250343622.jpeg","photo_id":250343622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/member_250343622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/thumb_250343622.jpeg"}},"members":20,"name":"BNI Chapter 61","id":18701485,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Chapter-61","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Power Networkers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435417153000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"communityorg","name":"Community Organizations","id":10485},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"community-gardening","name":"Community Gardening","id":74771},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Consciousness-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in food advocacy and promoting fairness across the board including supermarkets, restaurants, bars and even food trucks.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events.

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

You'll be on your feet quite a bit as I'm believer that you learn (and have more fun) through doing rather than hearing an instructor talk. Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If these are elements you would look for, my class may be worth a try.

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

It is designed to open your eyes for the society and world that we live in. Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered. Besides being a full-time mama, I am a facilitator and organizer of sacred ceremony as well as a shamanic practitioner, Reiki master, yoga teacher and BodyTalk practitioner.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/highres_440357671.jpeg","photo_id":440357671,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/600_440357671.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/thumb_440357671.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":566,"name":"AYAM Healing with Plants","id":18780380,"state":"NY","urlname":"AYAMHealingwithPlants","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438121636000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"cities","name":"Cities","id":69931},{"urlkey":"smart-city","name":"Smart City","id":72764},{"urlkey":"sustainable-cities","name":"Sustainable Cities","id":146918},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Join us if you are passionate about cities, think that public spending should be more open to new solutions and that cities should be amazing problem-solvers.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":128652852,"name":"Sascha Haselmayer","photo":{"photo_id":170891702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/member_170891702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/thumb_170891702.jpeg"}},"members":53,"name":"Procurement 2.2 - Transform the way cities solve problems","id":18780723,"state":"NY","urlname":"Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438134813000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blues","name":"Blues","id":135},{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"tea","name":"Tea","id":230},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"ballet-and-modern-dance-on-stage","name":"Ballet and Modern Dance on Stage","id":22494},{"urlkey":"black-womens-issues","name":"Black Womens Issues","id":34443},{"urlkey":"fun-for-friends-and-their-friends","name":"Fun for Friends and Their Friends","id":44531},{"urlkey":"bargain-shopping","name":"Bargain Shopping","id":695852},{"urlkey":"meeting-old-friends-and-making-new-friends","name":"Meeting old friends and making new friends","id":1187892}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/meetup-group-sPxvyFeJ\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/f\/1\/600_440308913.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><i>If you're on Meet-Up you might have encountered a common theme many face today.

(If you missed out, check it out on youtube) The show was about a group of girlfriends making it through single life. I created this New Jersey group for women ( mid 20's to mid 30's) to cultivate a similar experience.

Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English?&nbsp; <br>3. Ready to work&nbsp;<i>REALLY&nbsp;<\/i>hard and do the REAL work that it will take to truly become fluent?&nbsp; <br>4. Are you also ready to have fun and make friends who are as serious about language learning as you are?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If so, my name is Monroe Mann, and WELCOME TO THE FLUENCY PROJECT.&nbsp; <br> <br>MY DEFINITION OF NATIVE-LEVEL FLUENCY:&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of what is said on TV, in movies, and on the radio&nbsp; <br>--can understand 99% of modern slang&nbsp; <br>--can effectively and clearly communicate orally and in writing, with 99% grammatical and linguistic accuracy, not including technical conversations&nbsp; <br>--can read modern fiction, history books, newspapers, and magazines with a 99% word and sentence comprehension rate, without use of a dictionary<\/p>\n<p>I'm a linguist myself, and speak Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, and others (at various levels of proficiency). While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example:&nbsp; <br>* read books;&nbsp; <br>* write essays;&nbsp; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises&nbsp; <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy&nbsp; <br>* give presentations;&nbsp; <br>* watch movies;&nbsp; <br>* listen to the radio;&nbsp; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on.&nbsp; <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:)&nbsp; <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":28,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

We don't have the luxury of wide open fields with no one around to bother. I am a member of a local aviation club, but it can take up an hour or longer each way to get there and it just isn't always practical. I like to fly small to larger airplanes as well. I've found that some respectful and cautious local flying in NYC can be possible if we really respect our surroundings and don't do stupid things. This meetup is only for RC Airplanes and unfortunately no Quadcopters or Drones. I own and enjoy some myself, but the reckless use of these had shed a negative light on the hobby and there are other groups for that. My aim is to gather some quiet, respectful and fun people to fly our planes as close to or in Manhattan without causing any issues and flying places which don't violate restrictions. I have a whole series of future events and plans that I am working on but this is a simple start.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176296482,"name":"Daso"},"members":25,"name":"New York Radio Control Airplanes Meetup","id":18842509,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Radio-Control-Airplanes-Meetup","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Flyers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439841579000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"classics","name":"Classic Books","id":506},{"urlkey":"comics","name":"Comic Books","id":794},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622},{"urlkey":"graphic-novels","name":"graphic novels","id":17935},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"geeks-nerds","name":"Geeks & Nerds","id":32623},{"urlkey":"books-and-drinks","name":"Books and Drinks","id":38966},{"urlkey":"reading-discussion","name":"Reading & Discussion","id":41530},{"urlkey":"modern-literature","name":"Modern literature","id":43767},{"urlkey":"horror-book-club","name":"Horror Book Club","id":59744}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fiction-Addiction-NY\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p><span>Calling all novel nerds and literature ladies!

To name but a few: - A reliable, non-partisan database for where political candidates stand. Beneath all the spin and style, what is the substance? - An app where state and local governments can hear of infrastructure-related complaints from drivers. Also a way for people to crowd-source funding for infrastructure projects like decaying bridges. - A system where needy school districts - such as those afflicted by natural disasters - can acquire the resources and support for quality extracurricular programs. For example, one of its efforts shall try to provide musical instruments to schoolchildren, that they may discover their creativity and our rich musical heritage. For these and other endeavors, we seek contributors of various types. From the entrepreneurs who can strengthen the intellectual and moral foundations, to the advisors who can provide technical support and expertise, to the coders who can bring these endeavors to life (and even teach the code neophytes a thing or two!) - we happily welcome you into this community.

Create a strong member network for local innovators, equip them with the resources they need to prosper, create jobs, and function in harmony with local ecosystems. 2. Keep Dollars in the Local Economy\/Reduce Capital Leakage \u2013 for every $100 spent at a locally-owned business, $73 remains in the local economy, compared to that of a non-locally owned business which only retains $43. We know that entrepreneurship fuels economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low wage jobs and into the middle class. 3. Increase small business visibility and foster Economic Inclusion; locally owned businesses build strong communities. By sustaining vibrant communities, linking neighbors via economic and social relationships, leading to strong healthy engaged communities. Now is the time to join forces to protect, foster, and strengthen the local businesses in our neighborhoods that give us a sense of place, ensure our diverse culture, and provide us with strong unique communities we are proud to call home","lon":-74.1699981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14366314,"name":"Karen Brown-Stovell"},"members":21,"name":"Newark Forward Ever Business Alliance Meetup","id":18889045,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Newark-Forward-Ever-Business-Alliance-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Localists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441121892000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"spanish","name":"Spanish Language","id":183}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More-testing\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Tus us to nick si do belfry fleet bled Clift sm ni fb agog Cheryl varnish cleon Xbox sm bc clerk Clifty salud cl do all\u00edspey delito vi salvocorreo claro<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":151833872,"name":"Amy ","photo":{"photo_id":204896122,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/member_204896122.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/b\/3\/a\/thumb_204896122.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"More testing","id":18889179,"state":"NY","urlname":"More-testing","category":{"name":"language\/ethnic identity","id":16,"shortname":"language"},"lat":40.6899986267,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441122327000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"hadoop","name":"Hadoop","id":18060},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"spark","name":"Spark","id":360491},{"urlkey":"big-data-analytics","name":"Big Data Analytics","id":383411},{"urlkey":"apache-spark","name":"Apache Spark","id":1471442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Spark-Meetup\/","rating":4.8,"description":"NYC Spark users group for those interested in distributed computing technologies.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":117500482,"name":"Matthew Hunt","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/highres_229314142.jpeg","photo_id":229314142,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/member_229314142.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/7\/e\/thumb_229314142.jpeg"}},"members":500,"name":"New York Spark Meetup","id":18889202,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Spark-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Sparkies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1441135114000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"philanthropy","name":"Philanthropy","id":9874},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"charity-philanthropy","name":"Charity & Philanthropy","id":57223},{"urlkey":"social-philanthropy","name":"Social Philanthropy","id":113816}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BE-A-FRIEND-Walkathon-2015\/","rating":0,"description":"Join friends, family members and colleagues as you walk, run or stroll along beautiful Hudson River Park in support of Samaritans 24-hour Suicide Prevention Center at our 2nd Annual BE A FRIEND 5K Walkathon, Saturday, September 19.
