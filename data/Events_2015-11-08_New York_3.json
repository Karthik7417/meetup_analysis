But Doug Cutting, the Hadoop creator, predicted that, in the future, organizations will run all sorts of workloads on their Hadoop clusters, even online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads. Although Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix provide high throughput, low latency, random access on big data, developers struggle with the lack of ACID transactions. Trafodion is a world class Transactional SQL RDBMS running on HBase\/Hadoop, currently in Apache incubation. In this talk we will discuss the characteristic of operational workloads, the operational use cases Trafodion addresses, and why Trafodion is the right solution for these use cases. In particular, we go in depth of what is the recipe for a world class database engine, and how Trafodion implements the ingredients that make up that recipe such as world class query optimizer, parallel data flow execution engine, distributed transaction management system, performance, scale, availability, and future directions, etc.<\/p> <p><br\/>Speaker:<br\/>Rohit Jain is the CTO at Esgyn for Trafodion, a transactional SQL-on-HBase RDBMS.

She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.<\/p> <p>Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets G\u00e4etan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.<\/p> <p>With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/thenewmontclairbookclub\/events\/224131601\/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah","id":"224131601","time":1444950000000,"updated":1444962528000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434678749000,"name":"The New Montclair Book Club Meetup","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":18683399,"urlname":"thenewmontclairbookclub","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Book lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443647920000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey All!

So, sign on with us for the conference call to discuss issues and contribute your thoughts about what we can be doing politically. Our conference calls are open to the public and are for all of us who are interested in the Christian Party of America. It is an easy-access way to share ideas and learn more about what is going on around the country with the Christian Party of America. Hope you can make it!<\/p> <p><br\/>The conference call will last for about an hour but staying for the entire call is optional.\u00a0 If you get a message that the circuits are busy, just keep trying the number and it eventually works. There is no extra charge to participate other than the usual charges required by your phone plan for a long distance call. You can, even, listen in on the conference call while at other events. Just hit *6 to mute your phone and you can do two things at once!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Christian-Party-of-America-NY\/events\/225960420\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"A BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIAN LIFE-CONFERENCE CALL","id":"dwnqghytnbtb","time":1444955400000,"updated":1444967816000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1305604485000,"name":"Christian Party of America (NY)","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1871871,"urlname":"Christian-Party-of-America-NY","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Christian Constitutionalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"140 E 27th St","name":"Stone Creek Bar & Lounge","lon":-73.982437,"id":23746941,"lat":40.741829,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.690958559513,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439840936000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/d\/0\/a\/600_442840202.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Let's meetup at 8:30 PM to socialize before the show!<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>You've spent all week busting your hump!<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Now it's time to unwind, loosen up the tie, say inappropriate things, get hammered, and most importantly laugh til it hurts!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Back by popular demand the \"Let Me Speak To Your Manager\" show is bringing you the best up and coming comics in NYC, all of whom have been featured on Comedy Central, MTV, Letterman, Fallon, Conan, etc..!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>It all goes down at Stone Creek Bar and Grill in the back room.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Come down, enjoy some of the drinks from the fully stocked bar or some food off the awesome menu!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The show is free and has a 1 item minimum. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Come out and get over the hump with some laughs!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-Events-NYC\/events\/225952311\/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"name":"Live Comedy Meetup-Free Admission!","id":"jtgbklytnbtb","time":1444955400000,"updated":1444995930000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430847798000,"name":"! \"Free Events\" !","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":18577622,"urlname":"Free-Events-NYC","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10016","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"104 East 27th Street","address_2":"Between 3rd and Lexington","name":"Stone Creek Bar and Lounge","lon":-73.984267,"id":1163187,"state":"NY","lat":40.742591,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.594641029835,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430981364000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/c\/d\/3\/600_442840147.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You've spent all week busting your hump!

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive. They will learn how to use Light Room, Photoshop, Silver Efex Pro as well as Macphun Tonality to convert their color images to B&amp;W images.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This part of the workshop will run for 1-1\/2 to 2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>In the old days there was only monochrome photography. Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels. This is no different than tri-color separation filters that have Wratten designations of\u00a0 Wratten 29 - RED, Wratten 47 - BLUE and Wratten 61 - GREEN. We will use Photoshop and various plug-ins to create monochrome panchromatic renditions for your color images.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Once you have your images converted you will have the opportunity to have the image professionally printed at the workshop.<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/1\/600_442774817.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/b\/600_442774827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Here are several images that were planned as a B&amp;W image well before the moment of capture.

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive.

Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels.

Each participant will be able to work at their own computer station under the direction of our presenter, Shiv Verma. The lab has 12 computer work stations and we are limiting the number of participants to 12 photographers so that every participant will have a true hands on experience. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>Each participant should bring 5 or 6 of their favorite images loaded on a flash drive. They will learn how to use Light Room, Photoshop, Silver Efex Pro as well as Macphun Tonality to convert their color images to B&amp;W images. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This part of the workshop will run for 1-1\/2 to 2 hours.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>In the old days there was only monochrome photography. Today we have photographers who work exclusively in color and some who work exclusively in black and white while many create both color and black and white photos. With the tools and software available to us and the ease of converting color photos to black and white there's no reason not to try creating black and white images. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This hands on workshop will not only help you determine which of your existing photos might look good in black and white but it will also help you learn to visualize in black and white. Once you identify the image you want to convert, you will learn how to best convert it to exceptional black and white or monochromatic image. Realize that a RGB (color) image is composed of Red, Green and Blue channels. This is no different than tri-color separation filters that have Wratten designations of\u00a0 Wratten 29 - RED, Wratten 47 - BLUE and Wratten 61 - GREEN. We will use Photoshop and various plug-ins to create monochrome panchromatic renditions for your color images.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Once you have your images converted you will have the opportunity to have the image professionally printed at the workshop.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/1\/600_442774817.jpeg\" \/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/8\/0\/b\/600_442774827.jpeg\" \/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Here are several images that were planned as a B&amp;W image well before the moment of capture.

This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p><b>How long will the meetup be? <\/b><br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend.

Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Who should come?

His new book,<i> Creating Change Through Humanism<\/i><\/b><b>, lays out how and why people can lead moral and ethical lives without belief in a higher power. While surveys show that more and more Americans are giving up on religion, merely abandoning traditional religious faith is just one step on a path to a better way of thinking. Speckhardt explains how to take the next steps with the empathy and activism that characterize humanism today.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Humanism has inspired generations of individuals to improve themselves, their communities and their country. <i>Creating Change Through Humanism<\/i><\/b><b> describes how a humanist lifestance has influenced and can continue to advance acceptance, diversity and equality. Humanist ideals pervaded the U.S. from its founding, starting with the innovative idea of separating church and state to maintain a religiously-neutral government. Humanism has continued to propel our nation toward social progress by promoting basic human rights and dignity. The humanist movement, with its forward-thinking outlook and emphasis on critical thinking and self-reflection, has been at the forefront of such pressing social issues as civil rights, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ equality, responsible scientific freedom, and the environment and population dynamics.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Speckhardt interweaves personal stories, including his own, of individuals who have journeyed from organized religion to humanistic convictions. He encourages his readers to be open about their own lack of belief and to become active in social and political causes, so they can put their positive values into action and combat the anti-humanist prejudice propagated by the religious right.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0----------------------------------<\/b><\/p> <p><b>NEW LOCATION: EMERALD INN, 250 W 72nd St, (Rear Room) \/ ONE BLOCK WEST OF BROADWAY<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>COST: Free, but purchase drink or food to compensate Emerald Inn for their space<\/b><\/p> <p><b>======================<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"REAR ROOM","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/atheists-24\/events\/225480381\/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":9000000,"name":"NYC ATHEISTS BOOK CLUB - OCTOBER 16TH (FRIDAY) NEW LOCATION","id":"pvknllytnbvb","time":1445034600000,"updated":1445045594000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1035947374000,"name":"New York City Atheists Meetings","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12907,"urlname":"atheists-24","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Atheists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10011","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"150 West 17th Street New York, NY 10011","name":"Rubin Museum of Art Lounge","lon":-73.997795,"id":1594102,"state":"NY","lat":40.740017,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.803348362446,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1301985223000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A great way to get Dharma connected in New York!<\/p> <p><b>For people interested in Buddhism or meditation or just leading a kinder life who are up for meeting like minded people.<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Dharma Drink is now Self Service!<\/i><\/p> <p>The table is always reserved in the same spot - just show up and see what happens \u00a0- just like if you were hanging out meeting other Buddhists randomly in Kathamandu or India.

Madere primarily creates installation-based works featuring disparate materials such as salt, flowers, foodstuffs, and plastic tarps that are assembled and aggregated in a manner that insists on their material connections to society, economics, industry, and human emotion.

Having a character to fall back on gave us some sense of security later, when we faced audiences during spot improvisations. But I felt mostly that we were operating on pure guts.\u00a0<b>Guts improvising seemed less appealing a year or so later when I was introduced to Viola Spolin's improvising games. Here was a whole system that could be relied on. There was no joke making required, or even allowed, and yet the scenes that emerged were often hilarious. Rather than gags or conventional sketch comedy, what became funny was surprising human behavior. The main thing that emerges in Spolin's games is not the invention of funny stuff, but the discovery of things in you that you didn't know where there.\u00a0<\/b><\/i><i>It's true that a harder, laugh-oriented kind of performance is probably more appropriate for a cabaret show, but I think we might have benefitted from some training in Spolin's Theater Games before we set out to be consciously funny.\u00a0<b>The benefits of relating to the other player and the resulting spontaneity, I think, can be beneficial to any kind of playing. In fact, the games help in a surprising range of ways. I'm teaching Viola's games to scientists now and we're finding that after a short course in improv workshops, the scientist are able to speak about their work to audiences with far more clarity and vividness than they could before.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

We together are the Roots. The People. The Energy. You are the spirit inside all of it. The music, the art, the activities, they are the bonuses of our tribe's gatherings, but it all stems from YOU. So join us as we, Start at the Roots. As we take a trip into the Roots of our Tribe, we will be joined by Sound Shamans that will awaken the Spirit that lies deep within us. Joining us will be one of our tribes home grown shamans, KABAYUN of Sangoma Records, who will be playing a full power live set that will tease your senses. Along with him, we will have some of our tribes most talented shamans. We will have LUIS CAMPOS and EPSYLON perform a high energy tag set that will leave you screaming \"We want more!\" IZZY also of Sangoma Records will deliver his groovy style to us all and BETWEEN DEVICES will start the night just right with his bouncy beats. Our space will be transformed by WIZART VISIONS, who will create a psychedelic paradise that will result in deep mystical experiences. Justine will be providing massages, enjoy some hookah at the Magic Hookah Lounge and connect with other members of the tribe. KIRKWORX will be UV body painting and Olga Klimova will be live painting.

We all take part in making the magic of the night. Each one us unknowingly takes part in the creation of this tribal gathering. YOU being the roots of the tribe, what's important is that you bring your smile, laughter, energy and spirit. This tribal aspect of the community coming together and taking part in the night, creates connection between new and old friends, builds trust in the community, teaches us how to work together and proves to us that we can create anything together. This tribal aspect will introduce an alternative to mass society, it will introduce a modern tribal way of life.<\/p> <p>\u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665<\/p> <p>LOCATION: The Paper Box<br\/>17 Meadow Street<br\/>Brooklyn, New York DATE: October 16th, 2015<\/p> <p>TIME: 10pm - 5am<\/p> <p>AGE: 21+<\/p> <p>PRESALE TICKETS - $30<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=9XJLMAWH8PXQA\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=9XJLMAWH8PXQA<\/a><\/p> <p>TICKETS AT THE DANCE TEMPLE - $35<\/p> <p>\u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665<\/p> <p>\u2606~\u263d\u272a\u263e~\u2606 WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO? \u2606~\u263d\u272a\u263e~\u2606<\/p> <p>A well informed tribe allows us to build trust from within. We want everyone who supports the gatherings to know where their money goes when attending. All proceeds get split 3 ways. 33.3% of proceeds go to a fundraiser to better the world that will be announced before every event. 33.3% will go to building our tribes next event. The final 33.3% will go to building next summers outdoor festival. We together are creating an experience that will grow our spirit, helping to bring the worlds best musicians, psychedelic artists and deco crews. This event we will be donating to GreenPeace USA. The Arctic is one of the most unique places on Earth. It spans eight countries, is home to more than 13 million people and provides a habitat for some of the most incredible wildlife on Earth. And now, it\u2019s the battleground for what could be the most important fight in environmental history. This is about CLIMATE CHANGE. This is about WILDLIFE. This is about PEOPLE. This is about OUR FUTURE. We will be donating a third of our proceeds to this cause. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/usa\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/usa\/<\/a> \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665<\/p> <p>Be sure to check out our gathering next summer Gaia Festival 2016 \"A Gathering of the Tribes\" August 26-28th 2016 - New Moon Weekend - Upstate New York<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1533901950200836\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1533901950200836<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Entheogen-Integration-Circle\/events\/225435085\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":25200000,"name":"Spirit Tribe Presents: Tribal Roots","id":"225435085","time":1445047200000,"updated":1445507500000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1440608947000,"name":"Entheogen Integration Circle","group_lon":-74.0500030518,"id":18870894,"urlname":"Entheogen-Integration-Circle","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Lovelights"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"443 E 6th St","name":"Amor y Amargo","lon":-73.984276,"id":24146132,"state":"NY","lat":40.725739,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.70630800724,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444628989000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The last drinks night was a lot of fun so we're going to try it again.

Will we get to them all? Sign-up and weather will determine the exact plan - will we leave Friday or Saturday night and stay over? Do half Saturday and half Sunday? Return home in between? Stay in a motel? To be decided... If you think you are interested, please sign up and let me know your preference.<\/p> <p>Update as of Oct. 13:<\/p> <p>It's finally here! The NJ Lighthouse challenge!<br\/>At the first stop, you buy a $2 entry sheet to participate in the challenge. Each lighthouse and life-saving station in NJ has a souvenir to give out and will validate the entry sheet - at the end, completed entry sheets are eligible for a drawing. Here's the website for more info: <a href=\"http:\/\/lhchallengenj.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/lhchallengenj.org\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Here's the plan:<\/p> <p>Saturday, Oct. 17, 8am - 6pm:<\/p> <p>Leave the church at 8am (other cars may leave from other locations and meet us) and head to the first lighthouse along the Delaware River. We will make our stops as short as possible (20 min?) in an attempt to reach as many lighthouses as possible. I think just the driving added up to more than 8 hours, so I don't expect to reach all of them the first day. We will reach as many as possible by 4PM and then head home, most likely by 6pm. Bring food, or expect to eat take-out in the car while riding.<\/p> <p>Sunday, Oct. 18, 10am - 4pm???:<\/p> <p>Pick up where we left off, or start at Sandy Hook and work our way down to finish all of the route - departure time and route direction will be determined by the end of Day 1, based on how many lighthouses are left to see and whether there's someplace we want to spend a little more time. I expect 10am-4pm (so those who wish to, may attend 8am church), but that may change, so check the night before.<\/p> <p>Follow us one day, both days, or do it on your own!

If you have never heard of this trail, take a look here:<a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/escarpmenttrail.com\/<\/a><\/a> This is one of the most beautiful places for hiking and trail running in New York state.<\/p> <p>Here is a video from the 2013 Escarpment\u00a0 Trail race:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71310538<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that we are not traversing the entire trail (if you really want to do all 19 miles,\u00a0let me know and we'll figure out how to set it up). Also, if you're interested on doing this trip on Sunday, let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>I \u00a0will get you there and back and will take care of the day pass to the campground, and also we'll have lots of fruit and bottled water for everyone. We'll also have few picnic\/beach \u00a0blankets.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will start hiking\/running at North-South lake campground. I suggest doing about 5 miles of the trail (to the crashed airplane, or maybe a bit further), and then turning around. I will be staying at the back of the group, and faster hikers\/runners can go ahead of us if they want to.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/b\/8\/600_442244984.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>The beauty of this plan is that it's impossible to get lost. The trail is VERY EASY TO FOLLOW (it is well-marked with blue markers) so you can go at your own pace and turn around when you feel like it. Just be sure to get back on time before we leave (5pm sharp).<\/p> <p><br\/>You are welcome to hike with anyone else in the group, but all abilities are welcome and everyone can enjoy this trail at their own pace.\u00a0 The trail is rugged and at times very steep. Please prepare accordingly. There is no any water on the trail, so be sure to have enough with you. On weekends there are lots of people hiking there, so we certainly won't be alone there.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/7\/4\/600_441415156.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Other activities that you might choose to enjoy during our trip to the campground: <\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>- hiking around the lake,<\/p> <p><br\/>- visiting scenic spot of Mountain House,<\/p> <p><br\/>- renting a boat (availability might be limited),<\/p> <p><br\/>- suntanning and enjoying the beach.<\/p> <p>More information about the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/outdoor\/24487.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Map of the campground is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/docs\/permits_ej_operations_pdf\/northsouthlake2015.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/1\/3\/600_440542291.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There are nice showers and bathrooms right by the beach (which is also our parking area and starting\/finishing point of the hike\/run).

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You must be ready to become a partner in your own business. We will build the ground floor of a kickass digital marketing and product development agency. \u00a0The founding partnership in the agency is four way: 4 X 25%.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What you must be\u2026<\/b><\/p> <p>You need to be ready to take a risk. There are no guarantees and the first 4 - 6 months may involve irregular pay. Everything we are doing is an experiment in building the next gen. hyper-efficient company.\u00a0 No one has done what we are attempting. You will learn about balanced job complexes. You will be challenged by a spectrum of high-end conceptual-strategy work and mundane-grunt work. But, you will be experiencing these in a completely new, fast-paced, participatory, knowledge-sharing environment. You will have more responsibility and more reward.<\/p> <p><b>What you will experience\u2026<\/b><\/p> <p>If this works you will become part of a self-replicating, team-generating, non-hierarchical network based company. We grow without departments, without middle management, and with a ridiculous competitive advantage. We are superfast, super responsive, super-efficient, and committed to the flat model that keeps us that way.<\/p> <p><b>Who I am...<\/b><\/p> <p>My name is Atma - I am a behavioral scientist who specializes in startups and entrepreneurship.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What I have built...<\/b><\/p> <p>Using a new application of the lean framework I have reinvented the startup accelerator - this means I will create more successful startups than any program out there.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Why I have built this<\/b><\/p> <p>The future belongs to the creative, adaptive, meaning-creating, clear-thinkers. The paradigm I am introducing prepares all its participants for this future; a future without zero-sum, soul-stealing workplaces.<\/p> <p><b>My Problem<\/b><\/p> <p>Because my model relies heavily on testing cycles, lean growth hacking, full stack marketing and lean product development I have hit a bottleneck with my member companies. \u00a0I simply do not have the bandwidth to support them with all the steps involved. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Going to outside agencies is not a solution. \u00a0They are too siloed, too expensive, and too far out of my full stack lean framework.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Your opportunity<\/b><\/p> <p>Consequently, you have a chance to become a founding partner in a new kind of support agency to match the needs of this evolutionary accelerator.<\/p> <p>Therefore I am announcing the first\u00a0<i>Startups on Steroids Agency Build-a-thon<\/i>. The goal is to find four partners and build the agency in one night.<\/p> <p>This highly unusual and experimental event aims to create a partnership of full stack digital marketing, growth hacking, UX product development, and possibly design and coding experts. \u00a0We will select an interdisciplinary team, who together will become superstars capable of using my framework to make startups succeed. \u00a0In other words, we will endeavor to build a new kind of agency in one night.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/c\/6\/600_442842182.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Why do this in a one night event?<\/b><\/p> <p><b>First<\/b>, we are in a big hurry because we have clients waiting. We have at least \u00a0three clients with funding who are ready to start, and several others who are interested, but were unwilling to commit because the agency was not ready. Additionally, the sooner we exist as an agency the sooner I can continue my already successful sales process.<\/p> <p><b>Second<\/b>, this collaborative event is the future of hiring. This event is representative of how we operate and how we teach others to hire and grow.<\/p> <p><b>Three openings - 4 partners<\/b><\/p> <p>We will be looking for a total of 3 new partners (not including me - I will be the in charge of sales and strategy and be the managing partner).<\/p> <p>These are the suggested roles for the agency, based on both the priority of need and the flow of our full stack lean framework:\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>1) \u00a0Full stack digital marketer\/growth hacker and engagement expert (validation and scale) [wanted]<\/b><\/p> <p>Manages campaign: Optimisely, webhooks, keyword planning, ad words buys, Facebook ad creation (LinkedIn, too), A\/B testing, stochastic data analysis, manage incremental ad budgets...<\/p> <p>Manages customer acquisition:\u00a0 inbound marketing, outbound marketing<\/p> <p>SMM, SEO, CRM, pipeline analytics, referral engagements, basically full funnel discovery\u2026<\/p> <p>This role spans the discovery stage, which is pre-product\/market fit and the scaling stage, which is post-product\/market, fit.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2) \u00a0Lean Creative &amp; Design [wanted]<\/b><\/p> <p>Manages creative: works with outsourced support - supervises: copywriting, explainer video, landing page development; anti-design (aka lean design), color schemes, style guides, usability, and affective interaction.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the client grows, this will include coordination of brand strategy, content strategy, blogger relations, and community management.<\/p> <p><b>3) Lean Product development [wanted]<\/b><\/p> <p>Manages MVPs, rapid prototyping, and single feature releases:\u00a0supports lean development, works with offshore coders, and supervises surveys and\u00a0<i>ethnographic interviews<\/i>, supervises tech issues.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This role is an important part of the product\/market fit discovery process. It will require someone with a good understanding of UX and product development. While the role also requires an experiential understanding of coding and product development, it is unlikely that it will involve much coding.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a04)\u00a0Sales &amp; Strategy [Atma]<\/b><\/p> <p>Client acquisition, agency strategy, organizational development, business development.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/d\/2\/600_442842194.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>The future of teams - circles not pyramids<\/b><\/p> <p>These roles have a great deal of potential fluidity. We, however, will be going beyond fluidity and creating the agency model of the future. In this lean model, everybody gets to do fun work (conceptual-strategizing-thinking-stuff), but we all share in the grunt work (mundane, rote tasks, like execution and boring stuff). This new distribution of tasks into balanced job complexes has a profound impact on the psychology and efficiency of the team. Suddenly the group mind is able to work much more effectively and to streamline much of the grunt work.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It does mean learning some new skills, often in areas beyond your initial expertise. Even so, this cross-learning, and sharing of grunt work goes a long way to enhancing the group\u2019s capacity and efficiency.\u00a0 It also provides a way to even out the workflow. This is evolutionary shit.<\/p> <p><b>A night of games ands problem solving<\/b><\/p> <p>You are invited to an event that shows us how teams with collaborative chemistry self-select. This is the next level of team and organizational development.<\/p> <p><b>Creating the ideal workplace<\/b><\/p> <p>An agency is not a 10X proposition (meaning something that will scale exponentially). But, an agency with a fee + equity arrangement with its clients will be a self-sustaining entity that pays good salaries, benefits, bonuses, and provides some future security to its founders and employees. While the early founders will get some financial incentive for taking the risk of establishing this agency, in the long run it will become a highly equitable place, where revenues support all the employees proportionately and appropriately.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, because I specialize in creating highly functional-fun workplaces, this may be one of the coolest places to work. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>How the business will operate<\/b><\/p> <p>This will be a partnership that will work with the many emerging startups in the Startup Ecology pipeline. Our new super agency will be an arm (or sister?-still working out the metaphors) of our accelerator. \u00a0As such, the agency will share in the equity of the accelerator (which of course is taking equity in all the emerging companies). \u00a0The agency will get paid for its work but at a discount since they are also accruing equity. Some of the fees will come directly from members in the pre-accelerator, and some will come from our own internal fund used to support those startups that have qualified for support. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Startup Ecology\u00a0(the accelerator our agency is a part of) takes 1% equity for every $4000 of services we provide\u00a0(up to 9%). Because our clients are part of a cradle to exit accelerator program, and because we are growing them and understanding them across all facets of their business development, we are able to be very specific and lean in the support we give them. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Our clients are many times more likely to succeed than a typical agency\u2019s client. \u00a0Our clients are high-level entrepreneurs who are trained in all the best practices of entrepreneurship 3.0. Consequently, they are also far less demanding to work with since they are following our lead and our instructions. This reduces account management and considerably simplifies client-agency relationships.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The agency is being designed to be its own self-sustaining profit center. \u00a0In the beginning wages will be kept low (with no guarantees) and apportioned as disbursements to partners.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will actively seek clients for the agency bringing them in both directly and through the pre-accelerator. \u00a0Everybody can (and should) participate in the acquisition process, which involves going to meetups in the evening, meeting nice people. \u00a0Often there is beer.<\/p> <p>Another cool difference in this type of agency is customer client relations. Our clients generally come from our school and our accelerator. Consequently, they are pre-disposed to do what we tell them to do. We are their growth and innovation department, and they will follow our lead. This removes a huge chunk of the worst source of inefficiency for agency.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/d\/b\/600_442842203.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>The four ways we gain new clients<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 1) \u00a0Pre-accelerator -<\/b><\/p> <p>Companies that are not immediately fundable (and without a valuation) will be recommended to select a low cost package for support, including MVP product development and testing cycles. \u00a0These packages will be billed as a combination of cash and equity (1% for every $4000). \u00a0In some cases we may elect to defer fees.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 2) \u00a0Accelerator -<\/b><\/p> <p>Companies that are being supported by our internal fund will have their agency fees covered (also in exchange for equity.) They will also have their coworking fees covered. \u00a0Living stipends will be negotiated and require submission of personal finances.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 3) \u00a0Direct to agency -<\/b><\/p> <p>While we primarily want clients that have been through our startup training program and are in our accelerators program,\u00a0we will accept clients directly into the agency at full price. Even so, they will be encouraged to eventually join the accelerator program if that is appropriate and in both their and our interests.<\/p> <p><b>\u00a0 \u00a04)\u00a0Our school: an important funnel\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>A very effective means of attracting startups to our agency is our online school. This school, based on my framework, The Seven Disciplines of Successful Startups, is unlike any training program available. \u00a0Built on a new type of LMS platform it provides moderation, peer coaching, and access to mentors. \u00a0Additionally, it is available at a low monthly subscription of $29.\u00a0<\/p> <p>All startups that complete the first 8\u00a0lessons are automatically eligible for our pre-accelerator.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b><i>Some additional notes -<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Blogger Relations -<\/b>\u00a0a separate company, nested inside of the agency, will be created using interns and virtual assistants to create a database of niche bloggers pertinent to our clients.

In this context, at its most focused, all of our internal judgments, commentaries and stories about the object or thought are reduced or drop away.<\/p> <p>In the Buddhist teachings there are two main ways we can cultivate our skills of CONCENTRATION. First, by dropping all the stories, judgments, commentaries we have about an object or thought, we are able to have direct experiences with a clear mind of \"becoming one with the object with no distractions.\" Letting go of the stories we create around objects or thoughts may seem like a pretty simple instruction, but since we created those stories, we are strongly identified with them and it's like letting a part of our Self go.<\/p> <p>Secondly, we can work with overcoming and getting rid of the obstacles or hindrances to awareness - those things that keep us from knowing what's really going on. As the obstacles of clinging, anger, dullness, restlessness and doubt fall away, we are left with \"a natural concentration, a natural clarity, stillness and stability.\"<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

She suffered from polio, and was paralyzed from the waist down; Wyeth was moved to portray her when he saw her one day crawling through the field towards her house. \"Christina's World\" was to become one of the most well-loved and most scorned works of the twentieth century, igniting heated arguments about parochialism, sentimentality, kitsch and elitism that have continued to dog the art world and Wyeth's own reputation, even after the artist's death in 2009.

Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early as the sooner everyone arrives, the sooner we can begin playing. Note that all games stop at 7:45pm as we have to be out of the gym by 8:00pm.

Play by ones and twos to 11 - win by one point.<\/p> <p>2. Make it - take it.<\/p> <p>3. Backcourt if the ball hits the rim or backboard. Air balls are fair game to put right back up.<\/p> <p>4. Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game. Teams will regulate themselves but let's make sure everyone plays.<\/p> <p>See you on the court!

There is a waiting list if all spots have been taken. We ask that you please just do not show up unannounced as you will kindly be asked to turned away. Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

Please, arrive 10 minutes before the game so we can get the teams set up.<\/p> <p><b>Game Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We'll play three simultaneous games of 8 on 8, with small goals.

Please check our meetup message board on Friday night or before 12.00 pm on Saturday to see what team you are on. This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

Jump balls\/disputed calls will be determined by a three pointer since the laws of basketball physics are very clear that \"the ball never lies.\"<\/p> <p>5. Walls, half-court line, and ceiling are out of bounds. 6. Subs will enter the game no later than 6 points in (once one of the teams reaches 6 points). The sub will start the following game.

Also feel free to bring your own basketball for shoot-around. And don't forget to clip your nails prior to game day.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in.

They care to keep improving their \u2018touch intelligence\u2019 so as to be aware of another\u2019s needs and boundaries.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A HETEP GATHERING starts with an invocation to\u00a0the Elements and the various aspects of the Mother Goddess. The space created is sacred and safe for all of us to share our experiences - our thoughts and feelings, our presence, and the rhythms of our breathing as we participate in the expansion of our touch perception.<\/p> <p>This event is expanding now to include everyone interested in evolving their 'touch intelligence'. It has been a monthly women's gathering and a wonderful opportunity to share and celebrate our intention, strength, and life experience!<\/p> <p>You're invited to join this ongoing class at any time. It is 'by donation', because your healing presence is the most important material you can contribute! So please come and donate your body to the science of healing - we will return it renewed and energized.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Every gathering starts with an introduction of ourselves in a circle. You will be introduced to this simple healing touch method. We will practice on each other on the floor lined with yoga mats and blankets. You may want to wear comfortable clothes and bring a yoga mat. This program is designed for every body shape and sensory ability - or sensitivity!\u00a0<\/p> <p>HETEP facilitator, Karuna Ma has been introduced to healing touch very early in life. Since 1998, qualified as a Reiki Master Healer and Seichim Master Teacher. Seichim energy is sometimes called 'Egyptian Kundalini' as it is great at assisting a breakthrough experience for both physical and psychic well-being. Since her training in 2001, Karuna has been working as a massage therapist, energy and sound healer.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Montclair_Shamanic_Circle\/events\/225807961\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"HETEP Healing Touch Program","id":"jgbnjlytnbwb","time":1445119200000,"updated":1445127612000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1314900121000,"name":"Montclair Shamanic Circle","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":2424042,"urlname":"Montclair_Shamanic_Circle","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Shamanic Practioners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07005","country":"us","city":"Boonton","phone":"(973) 334-0421","address_1":"90 Parsippany Blvd","name":"Reservoir Tavern","lon":-74.411406,"id":1373947,"state":"NJ","lat":40.891717,"repinned":false},"headcount":9,"distance":24.1609916687,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440975039000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Some of us will be heading over from Tourne Park but you can also just meet us here, whatever works.<\/p> <p>Bevaqua's has been around over 75 years- it's pizza and alcohol, nothin fancy and better for it.

After it is shot down in mid air, the survivor of the plane is then in negotiations to be traded for a supposed Russian Spy they have in custody. With a few more complexions, this film is the perfect amount of smart, witty, and serious. Written by the Coen Brother, Steven Spielberg was able to get quite a bit of comedy out of these actors, while they simultaneously deliver sharp dialogue. Terrific performances, brilliant direction, a story definitely Spielberg worthy, and beautiful cinematography work. If you are a fan of this genre, it is not one to miss. I loved every second of \"Bridge of Spies\" and I cannot recommend it more. Although, it is definitely not for everyone. It is a bit lengthy, but the pace was perfect in my opinion. After thinking long and hard about what could have been a flaw or issue with this picture, I simply could not think of anything. \"Bridge of Spies\" is what filmmaking is all about.<\/p> <p>Hope to see \u00a0you there!\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Please meet us in the lobby - purchase your tickets in advance so we can sit together!","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/diningout-219\/events\/226084267\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Let's go see Bridge of Spies at the Alamo Drafthouse - Yonkers!","id":"226084267","time":1445121900000,"updated":1445179470000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1129506815000,"name":"Cheap Eats and other foodie delights of Westchester","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":211795,"urlname":"diningout-219","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Cheap Eats and Foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"210 west 35th St.","name":"John Sullivan's","lon":-73.990707,"id":24097310,"state":"NY","lat":40.751652,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.120124906301,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444971781000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>I got us a table downstairs.
