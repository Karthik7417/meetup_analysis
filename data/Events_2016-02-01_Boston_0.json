Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud.

We will explore the area trails for about 2 or 3 hours. Bring micro-spikes and, if there is sufficient snow,\u00a0snowshoes!\u00a0Dress appropriately for the weather as this is January in NH!\u00a0There will be nice views of Lake Massabessic (that you don't see other times of the year on these trails)\u00a0and animal tracks if there is snow. The Red Arrow restaurant in Londonderry is open on New Year's Day for those who want to get a bite to eat afterwards.<\/p> <p>*Rain or Blizzard conditions cancel the hike.*<\/p> <p>Massabesic Lake covers around 2, 561 acres and provides the drinking water for Manchester, NH so there is no swimming.\u00a0The lake holds more than 15 billion gallons of water and is\u00a05.6 miles long with a width\u00a0of 1.3 miles.<br\/>The average depth of the lake is 196 feet and\u00a0there are 6 main islands around the lake and several smaller islands.<br\/>The main islands are Grape, Fletcher, Brown, Birch, Picnic and Loon.<\/p> <p>The name Lake Massabesic came from the\u00a0Native Americans\u00a0and it means \u201cthe place of much water.\u201d One of the most famous chief\u2019s of the state, chief Passaconaway was killed on Lake Massabesic. He was in a canoe headed to Loon Island. The chief had memories of Look Island from when he was younger. A thunderstorm came along and lightning hit the canoe and the chief and the canoe instantly disintegrated. During the American Civil War, NH troops gathered, camped and trained\u00a0around Lake Massabesic before participating in the war. There is a section of the lake called Battery Point with building remains.<\/p> <p>****By signing up and\/or attending this hike you agree to the Liability Waiver Below:<br\/>Remember: Your Event Organizers \u00a0are volunteers.\u00a0You are solely responsible for your own safety and enjoyment.

At the end of the evening, we will give you a brief description of the practice of Orgasmic Meditation and information on where to learn more.

However, any time estimate given by an Event Organizer is just that. Actual times vary greatly according to weather, trail conditions and the group itself. Don't sign up if you've scheduled something later in the day.\n<\/p> <p>The Organizer is not responsible for getting you back in time.

We are committed to being there for you. If you are not equally committed to being there then please don't sign up.\n<\/p> <p>This hike is rated Easy. You should be able to stay with the group. This is a group event and participants are expected to follow the lead, stay together, stop at junctions or summits, and support all participants should circumstances require teamwork.<\/p> <p><br\/>We start together and finish together. If you decide to leave the group at any time, you are on your own. We hike in light rain or showers, but heavy snow or extreme cold weather cancels. Bring water, hiking boots (not sneakers), bug spray and lunch\/snacks. Protect yourself against deer ticks and dress in layers.\n<\/p> <p>No dogs and no guests are allowed on hikes. Have your guest join the group so they can agree to the liability waiver and attend an event.\nYour Event Organizers are volunteers, the event is free and we are all adults.

In addition, Dr. Sung will lead participants to practice the calligraphy of ancient hieroglyphs or modern regular script styles (kai-shu). Individualized instructions will be provided based on each participant\u2019s level of previous experience. For this workshop on January 2nd, you will have an opportunity to learn and create your own arts \u2013 by writing Chinese characters on a sheet of red paper (a Chinese New year tradition: Spring Festival Couplets), guided by Dr. Sung. Furthermore, participants are encouraged to bring their favorite words in English and learn their translations in Chinese characters. Participants will practice writing the characters on paper. Afterword, the best characters will be designated \u201cyour artwork of the day\u201d. All will love the feel of each stroke and be amazed by power of each on as well as their meaning for the heart and for your well-being. Please come and learn this unique method of self-empowerment and healing in this creative and dynamic class. This workshop is appropriate for anyone age 10 and above. Children under 10 may be admitted with the instructor\u2019s prior approval. - RSVP \u2013 ([masked])<br\/>Participants will receive hand written Chinese calligraphy.

Dr. Yung-Chi Sung M.A., Ph.D.<br\/>Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Yung-Chi grew up in a family of teachers. His parents were both teachers. His father taught physics and his mother taught Chinese literature. This may explain how and why he developed a mind that simultaneously admired arts and appreciated the sciences. Dr. Sung has a B.S. in Psychology from Soochow University in Taipei, , an M.A. in Linguistics (with a minor in Cognitive Science), an M.A. in Educational Psychology (with a minor in Psychology), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in Psychological Foundation, Learning, and Cognition, and a minor in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Psychology). He was a research assistant at the Department of Psychology, National University, Taipei, Taiwan. In 1997 he went to University for graduate studies and was a research assistant and method\/statistics consultant at University of Minnesota Medical School from 1998 to 2005. Within that period of time, he also served as the President and on the Board of Directors, was Chair of Education and Community Development Committee, Chair of Finance Operation Committee, and Chair of Policy Committee for Chateau Student Housing Cooperative, a not-for-profit co-op providing affordable housing for students from diverse backgrounds, including US and international students. He served as Assistant Director of Outcomes Assessment at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) at Adelphi, Maryland from 2005 to 2008, where for one year he also taught Tai-Chi for stress relief as a diversity initiative. From 2008 to 2014, he was the Director of Evaluation and Assessment at the Tufts University School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. In 2015, he accepted the position as Director of Assessment and Institutional Effectiveness at Northwestern Health Sciences University, a university aspiring to be a world-class health sciences university, that educates students, practitioners, and leaders in health and wellness solutions to help people live healthier lives. Yung-Chi is a long-term devoted educator. He has been an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMUC since 2006, and was promoted to Adjunct Associate Professor in 2015. He is also an Associate Professor at NWHSU. He is currently developing a not-for-profit organization (YUAN3 CHIH4 EDUCATION) to promote global sharing of educational and health care resources. In his spare time he enjoys reading, writing, dreaming, dancing (recently salsa and argentine tango), and occasionally playing poker (currently no-limit Texas Hold\u2019em).<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bostonchina\/events\/227703870\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Spiritual Art of Chinese Calligraphy and Tai Chi (New Year 2016 workshop)","id":"227703870","time":1451750400000,"updated":1451758655000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286765768000,"name":"The Boston China Interest Network \u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5174\u8da3\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8","group_lon":-71.0899963379,"id":1720042,"urlname":"bostonchina","group_lat":42.3400001526,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Hingham","address_1":"66 Leavitt St","name":"Hingham Public Library","lon":-70.874138,"id":22442452,"lat":42.234917,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.2510318756,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451662786000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us in the activity room of the Hingham Public library to meet other breastfeeding moms and talk about what to expect from your breastfeeding baby or toddler.

REVIEWS -<\/p> <p>1.Sarah is absolutely amazing, she helped me deal with and move on from issues that had been dormant for many years. The outcome of my sessions was extremely positive and I am forever grateful that Sarah was able to guide me through my healing process with her beautiful sounds! If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. Thank you Sarah!!!! 2. Two years ago I met Sara through a mutual friend at a time I needed healing the most. During her group sessions, she taught us to meditate and calm our thoughts while she played her Himalayan bowls, tuning forks and many other shamanic healing techniques. With her guidance I found an inner calmness and some clarity. After a few sessions I decided I would go deeper into myself and asked for Sara to guide me in private sessions. What happened in these sessions has changed me and given me strength to believe and listen to my inner self all while healing some core issues I haven't dealt with, stemming from as far back as my childhood!<br\/>Sara you are an angel among angels.<br\/>I am grateful. Thank you 3. It's hard to find a true healer that is meant to help others and trust someone to heal you, but since the first practice with Sarah I felt so connected and truly amazed by results. So strong, devoted and passionate, ready to give whatever it takes to help. Thank you so much for wonderful experiences, visions, expansion and healing.. !<\/p> <p>4. It's been over a year now and Sarah continues to help me and my family clear our paths and the results have been incredible - and now we are doing this long distance! What a blessing it has been to find this beautiful teacher and guide on our journey. When in the presence of someone whose work is their life's purpose, it can be felt and in Sarah's case, heard! Beautiful sounds creating beautiful results! Feeling lighter and more peaceful. Thank you so much. xo<\/p> <p>5. Peace - love - calmness within you it's absolutely amazing; can't wait to see you Sarah at your next session!!<\/p> <p>6. Wow. Get a sound healing from Sarah as soon as possible. It is really a life changing experience. We get so caught up in the world around us that we end up missing the world inside us. My experience with Sarah helped me get back in touch with my inner-world. What Sarah offers through her intuitive gifts, shamanic training, singing bowls and tuning forks is absolutely transformative. She is able to help you work through mental, emotional and physical blockages through the power of sound. I can't recommend Sarah more highly because she is the best at what she does. I've been practicing sound healing for years and Sarah is the most remarkable sound healer and teacher I've ever met. She does not just play the bowls. She invites them. Each time, depending on who she is healing, the bowls sound a different story and her intuitive power discovers what the story is and how it wants to play out. There are very few people that have this ability but what makes Sarah even more special is that she has the boundless compassion to heal with elegance and grace. I hope as many people support Sarah as possible as she is doing such an important service for all beings. She also does distant healings which are extremely effective. So, please, follow Sarah, receive a healing and be blessed in the source of beauty through which Sarah breathes, expands and heals.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles\/events\/227584894\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"Women's Sound Bath to set Your Intentions for 2016","id":"227584894","time":1451764800000,"updated":1451951323000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450052909000,"name":"Sound Bath - Sound Healing Circles - Women's Circles","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19209569,"urlname":"Sound-Bath-Sound-Healing-Circles-Womens-Circles","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Divine Souls"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"46 Beacon Street","name":"Boston Family Church","lon":-71.116005,"id":24270060,"state":"MA","lat":42.254009,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.70705223083,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451188885000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will read and discuss on the book \"World Scripture and the Teachings of Sun Myung Moon\". \u00a0We will make copies of some pages to read for the participants, and later copies of the book will be available for purchasing.<\/p> <p>The meeting place is a function room of Boston Family Church at 46 Beacon Street\u00a0is between State House and Starbucks a a corner with Charles Street. \u00a0If you get off MBTA Park Street Station, look at State House and shift your eyes to the left to find a tall building. \u00a0We are next to that tall building. \u00a0We are also near one of Boston Common Garage entrance close to Beacon Street.<\/p> <p>If you get lost on your way, please call[masked]-2305.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Between State House and Starbucks on Beacon Street next to Boston Common","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Studying-World-Scripture-and-Teachings-of-Sun-Myung-Moon\/events\/227647458\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"Read \"World Scripture and the Teachings of Sun Myung Moon\"","id":"rnldnlyvcbdb","time":1451764800000,"updated":1451769742000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1451150313000,"name":"Studying World Scripture and Teachings of Sun Myung Moon","group_lon":-71.0699996948,"id":19240751,"urlname":"Studying-World-Scripture-and-Teachings-of-Sun-Myung-Moon","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"World Scripture Students"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":4,"distance":1.72169387341,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450049109000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>FYI story is up!!!<\/i><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>This month's story will be available on or about the Monday before the meetup.

However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup. Therefore the number of RSVPs reflected here are NOT the total number of men or women registered.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and morning of the 4th. The second quarter moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year, but it could still be a good show if you are patient. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>April 22, 23 - Lyrids Meteor Shower. The Lyrids is an average shower, usually producing about 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet C\/1861 G1 Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce bright dust trails that last for several seconds. Unfortunately this year the glare from the full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Lyra, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>May 6, 7 - Eta Aquarids Meteor Shower. The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower, capable of producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rate can reach about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by comet Halley, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The new moon will ensure dark skies this year for what could be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight.

The shower runs annually from July 12 to August 23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. The second quarter moon will block most of the fainter meteors this year but if you are patient you should still be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>August 12, 13 - Perseids Meteor Shower. The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe, producing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will set shortly after midnight, leaving fairly dark skies for should be an excellent early morning show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>October 7 - Draconids Meteor Shower. The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The first quarter moon will block the fainter meteors in the early evening. It will set shortly after midnight leaving darker skies for observing any lingering stragglers. Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from city lights.

The shower runs annually from October 2 to November 7. It peaks this year on the night of October 21 and the morning of October 22. The second quarter moon will block some of the fainter meteors this year, but the Orionids tend to be fairly bright so it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>November 4, 5 - Taurids Meteor Shower. The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams.

The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The waning gibbous moon will block many of the fainter meteors this year, but if you are patient you should be able to catch quite a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>December 13, 14 - Geminids Meteor Shower. The Geminids is the king of the meteor showers. It is considered by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 multicolored meteors per hour at its peak.

It peaks this year on the night of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The nearly full moon will block out many of the fainter meteors this year, but the Geminids are so bright and numerous that it could still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini, but can appear anywhere in the sky.<\/p> <p>Source(s):<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.seasky.org\/astronomy\/astronomy-calendar-2016.html<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EverydaySpacer-com2\/events\/225006035\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Next Meteor Shower","id":"225006035","time":1451884500000,"updated":1451896413000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369503037000,"name":"Everyday Spacer Boston","group_lon":-71.0599975586,"id":8638442,"urlname":"EverydaySpacer-com2","group_lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Everyday Spacers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Anywhere","address_1":"1 Anywhere Rd","name":"Anywhere dark and looking North-East","lon":-71.382439,"id":24279635,"state":"MA","lat":42.407211,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":16.309009552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451805387000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The annual Quadrantid shower is nominally active during the first week of January, and is best seen from northerly latitudes.

Best hope of getting a ride is leaving a comment here asking if anybody is driving and willing to pick you up.<\/p> <p>PARKING - you must park at one of the metered spots if you park on Harvard property near the stadium. \u00a0They will patrol for cars parked illegally.<\/p> <p>COST - free while we play outdoors.<\/p> <p>ATTIRE -\u00a0Bring a *white* shirt and a dark\/vivid color shirt so we can easily divide into teams. \u00a0DO NOT BRING A GRAY SHIRT- you will annoy a lot of people if you do. Turf shoes or cleats recommended, and sneakers are fine. \u00a0Shin-guards optional- most people don't wear them. Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class.

The format is very relaxed and open\u2014 anyone interested in contemplative practice is welcome!<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>About Open Awareness Meditation Group<\/p> <p>At the heart of these meditation sessions is the silent exploration of what we refer to as Open Awareness. We all know what it means to feel closed, limited, vulnerable, or separate. What is it like to allow ourselves to return to our natural condition of openness, presence, non-separateness and ease? This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>We have been meeting for over a decade, and those who lead the meditations have known each other and been practicing together for many years. They have all deeply explored a variety of traditions\u2014 for some it has been the Tibetan Buddhist practices of Dzogchen or Mahamudra, for others it has been the Indian traditions of Yoga, or Advaita, or what is currently referred to as Nonduality (some popular examples of this are Francis Lucille, Rupert Spira, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti).\u00a0<\/p> <p>However all of these traditions ultimately point to the same truth, the truth of our basic awareness or presence which is beyond any tradition, practice or teaching. This is the presence we share, and the presence we are, beyond words. This is what we explore in our meetings.<\/p> <p>This group is unique in that there is no specific guiding teacher, lama, or guru. We all meet as equals to question, share, and inspire each other to explore the Open Awareness we most deeply are. The meetings are suitable for newcomers as well as experienced meditators, and all are very welcome.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group\/events\/227633622\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group Meetup","id":"dcmpgcyvcbgb","time":1451953800000,"updated":1452009113000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286150869000,"name":"Open Awareness Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":1716596,"urlname":"Open-Awareness-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":2.58282089233,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445080673000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will gather at 46 Fisher Ave #1 at 7:30pm, get settled and have a 30-minute sit; after a short break and discussion we will sit for another 30 minutes. \u00a0 Meditation instruction is given, and the meditation is guided to the extent that it is helpful to the group. \u00a0A $2 donation is recommended.<\/p> <p>On street parking is available on Fisher Ave. \u00a0The closest T-stop is Roxbury Crossing or Jackson Square on the Orange Line.<\/p> <p>Please be prompt, once we move downstairs to the meditation room, the door is locked.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JP-MH-Meditation-Group\/events\/227680961\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Meditation Group","id":"cdsnllyvcbgb","time":1451953800000,"updated":1451993053000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1441916919000,"name":"JP \/ MH (Boston) Meditation Group","group_lon":-71.0999984741,"id":18919060,"urlname":"JP-MH-Meditation-Group","group_lat":42.3300018311,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Peabody ","address_1":"Right off Highway 128.

Bring a ball if you have one.<\/p> <p>RSVP and CANCELING - the sooner you RSVP, the better. \u00a0That said, most people don't RSVP until around 10:30am the day of the meetup, so we make the call around 11:15am the day of the meetup about whether a game needs to be canceled. \u00a0Check here right before heading over.<\/p> <p>ETIQUETTE - we have A LOT of players in this meetup and play every (week)day. Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds.

It\u2019s the suppression of this innocent natural development that Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven poignantly examines in her first feature, MUSTANG, winner of the Europa Cinemas Label award at the Cannes Directors\u2019 Fortnight.<br\/>The film opens in a remote Turkish coastal village on the Black Sea as the school year ends for five sisters. But this will not be a summer filled with fun and childhood mischief. When a neighbour observes the long-haired, long-limbed girls at the beach, engaged in what she views as scandalous behaviour, she reports them to their grandmother and uncle, who have been the sisters\u2019 guardians ever since the death of their parents. And so harmless play becomes the catalyst for physical and emotional imprisonment.<br\/>All \u201cinstruments of corruption\u201d and pop-culture artifacts are removed from the house, girly outfits are replaced with formless brown dresses, and, following a brief escape to an all-female soccer match, bars are installed on the windows and gates erected at the home\u2019s entrance. As village aunties visit to instruct the girls in domestic duties and suitors begin to arrive, the house becomes a veritable \u201cwife factory.\u201d The eldest sisters are subjected to virginity tests and married off one by one, and the younger sisters look on in fear, resolving not to succumb to the same fate.<br\/>Co-written by Erg\u00fcven and Alice Winocour, MUSTANG is a sensitive and powerful portrait of sisterhood and burgeoning sexuality. Erg\u00fcven elicits wonderfully naturalistic performances from her mostly non-professional actors, who bring a vibrant, youthful energy to the film. Though the film has distinct echoes of Sofia Coppola\u2019s THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, it nevertheless signals the emergence of a singular and fierce new voice in Turkish cinema.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Movie-Screeners\/events\/227699765\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Mustang    1-5-16  Tue.

We'll discuss how to set up an email system that makes sense for you or your customer, starting with the domain name, then choosing the host and client, and taking steps to prevent threats that include spam, lockouts and break-ins. We'll do an in-depth exploration of Outlook as a tool for professionally managing mail throughout its long lifecycle, from arrival to long-term archiving.<\/p> <p>We'll also talk about how email can be an effective tool for outreach and business growth, taking as an example a pro bono email list for a non-profit that has also served a fruitful for-profit advertising function.<\/p> <p>See: <a href=\"http:\/\/bnug.org\/emailtopics.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/bnug.org\/emailtopics.html<\/a> for topics he will discuss.<\/p> <p><br\/>About the speaker Adam Frost<\/p> <p>Adam Frost works as the coordinator of Computer Care and Learning, an educationally-oriented computer helping company.

Daniel Jay used dyes, chemicals and chemical reactions to create art works inspired by the life and science of Claude-Louis Berthollet, one of the greatest French chemists, born in Talloires in 1748.<\/p> <p>Colleague of Lavoisier, friend and advisor to Napoleon, Berthollet contributed to both theoretical and practical chemistry. He developed the concept of chemical equilibrium and established the nomenclature for chemical compounds that we still use today. He served as director of dye manufacture at the Gobelins tapestry factory, where his work helped to make some of the most beautiful tapestries of their time.<\/p> <p>For this exhibition, Jay drew from Berthollet\u2019s science using dyes from his era such as Indigo, Cochineal, Madder and Turmeric and chemicals such as copper sulfate, alum, tin oxide and liquid bleach (which he invented) that he used for textile and tapestry manufacture. \u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Daniel Jay<\/b><br\/>Daniel Jay has had parallel careers in science (as a professor at Harvard and now Tufts University) and in art for the past 30 years. In the mid-1980s, he was elected a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows to do both science and art and was provided with both a laboratory and an art studio there. Recently, he began combining his two passions by developing a series of art influenced by science. Titled ARCHEMY\u00a0in Talloires, this current art uses chemicals and chemical reactions\u00a0to make novel marks on paper\u00a0to express how science inspired him throughout his life.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Directions and Parking Information<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>Getting here via public transportation (MBTA) Green\u00a0Line<\/b><\/p> <p>Get off at Arlington station.

This is typically\u00a0truth for those who have awakened spiritually to unity consciousness. To feel spiritually abundant, exudes a deep gratitude for the moment, for breath, for existence, for experience. Those who have truly touched unity consciousness see the divine in all things. When you are blessed enough to see the divine in all things, you can connect to the flow of all life.\u00a0 Everything is divinely given. Everything is an opportunity to BE. We want for nothing, because we embody the knowing that we already have everything. Our true nature expands through the entire universe; through and beyond all things. We become both everything and nothing. You can only really know this once unity consciousness has been fully embodied and you've expanded into presence.

When the discussion wraps up, we continue with more refreshments and socializing until around 9:00 when all attendees are welcome to join our open steering committee meeting.<\/p> <p>We \u00a0take donations at the door to cover the cost of the meeting ($5 is suggested).

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p>Develop Chi Power<br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<\/p> <p>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<\/p> <p>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/p> <p>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/p> <p>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<\/p> <p>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><b><i>Alternate Tuesdays at 7:30 PM at Unity of Somerville, located at 6 William Street at the corner of College Avenue<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Call (913)[masked] to learn more<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 45 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

Each day is a different mix of people, skill levels, and attitudes. \u00a0Most people playing do this for fun and\/or exercise in the middle of the day. \u00a0Please respect this by at least following these unspoken rules that we have:<\/p> <p>1) You may not hurt anybody- especially yourself. All of us just want to safely\u00a0return to the office\/class afterward.<\/p> <p>2) Do not yell at, criticize, or offer unsolicited \"tips\" to other players unless they ask for your opinion. It ruins an otherwise fun, all-skill-levels game. If you do this often, you may be asked to find another meetup.<\/p> <p>3) Be the first to get the ball if it goes out of bounds. Especially if you kicked it last or are the closest one to the ball.<\/p> <p>4) Fighting is prohibited. We've never come close to having a problem with this, but better stated aloud. If it gets physical, we may call the police as it becomes a felony\/legal matter.<\/p> <p>WHAT ELSE -\u00a0All skill\u00a0levels\u00a0welcome- it's a big mix.

This January he sets to embark on his own nation-wide tour in celebration of his debut comedy special, Give Em Hell, Kid.<\/p> <p>Raised in Hyattsville, Maryland, Jermaine began performing stand-up in 2006 while still in high school. On his 20th birthday he moved to NYC on a Megabus with three pieces of luggage and a dream. Before building a buzz with stand-up, Jermaine was featured in promos for McDonalds, Sobe, and Sports Illustrated. In 2012, Jermaine was one of the \u201cNew Faces\u201d at the Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival and was invited back the following year to tape Funny as Hell for HBO. He\u2019s toured nationally with College Humor, Comedy Central on Campus, and has one half of the internet sketch group BodegaCat Sanchez, alongside Kevin Barnett. He\u2019s been featured on two seasons of MTV2\u2032s Guy Code, @Midnight, and \u201cComedy Underground with Dave Attell\u201d. Now he\u2019s the co-creator, writer, and star of a new TV series, \u201cFriends of The People\u201d Tuesdays on TruTV. Now in LA, his stand up has been featured on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and has a development deal with ABC to create his own sitcom.<\/p> <p>The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson:<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0Op6psTwu4Y\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/0Op6psTwu4Y<\/a><\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jermainefowler.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.jermainefowler.com\/<\/a><br\/>Facebook: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jermaine.fowler\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jermaine.fowler<\/a><br\/>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jermaineFOWLER\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/jermaineFOWLER<\/a><br\/>Instagram: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jermainefowler\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jermainefowler\/<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aVaYfGFIdTI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/aVaYfGFIdTI<\/a><\/p> <p>$12 advanced $15 at the door 18+<\/p> <p>FB: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/911491602265738\/911496215598610\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/911491602265738\/911496215598610\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Comedy-shows-for-free-or-cheap\/events\/227172938\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":8100000,"name":"Jermaine Fowler at The Gas!

Vines were cultivated here a thousand years before Bordeaux because the climate could provide wines of greater strength. Even after the rise of Bordeaux, the Sud-Ouest's international reputation surpassed Bordeaux to the point that the Bordelaise ultimately conspired to close their markets. Thus today, the wines of the Southwest remain hidden treasures. Let's see what we can uncover!<\/p> <p>The Sud-Ouest encompasses a heterogeneous array of sub-regions that produce red, white, and ros\u00e9, as well as sweet whites. You're welcome and encouraged to bring whatever interests you, though the best wines are usually the reds of <b>Cahors<\/b>, <b>Madiran<\/b>, and <b>Fronton<\/b>, where the Malbec, Tannat, and the wildly distinctive Negrette varietals, respectively, are grown.

We'll start with a short introduction and discuss each of our intentions for how we want to work with the sound and then meditate for a few minutes to tune into each of our specific intentions. The general theme will be new years resolutions - specifically bringing in the vibrations we need! Then, everyone will sit or lie down on super comfy pillow mats (bring your own blanket) and we'll begin our journey into sound.<\/p> <p>I start by playing the 500 pound cast-iron temple bell and then I move into the sweet sounds of my Tibetan singing bowls.\u00a0What follows, I can't exactly say, as the sound decides what it wants to say. But you can expect to hear the rainbow voice, the sound of the overtone chant singing with the tibetan bowls. You won't be able to tell which is which but this is all part of the dance. You will even feel what it's like to have the bowls played on you as the sound moves your energy where it needs to go.

I\u00a0 believe so strongly in the importance of connecting to Spirit and raising your vibration in this way.\u00a0 I hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity.\u00a0 As one member put it, \"It's like therapy for your soul.\"\u00a0\u00a0 These sessions truly are like $200 workshops! <b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>To encourage and support your practice and our community, if you pay for 4 sessions, the fee will be only $60 (in-person, cash or check), to be used within 4 months of your payment.\u00a0 <i>You can also choose to pay for one class at a time for $20. <\/i>These fees help to cover all of my costs and the significant time I put into running and preparing for all of the events and the meetup itself.

It\u2019s also an opportunity to peacefully transform your problems, your fears, and any pain and stress in your life into something more positive.<\/p> <p>I also consider meditating one of the most direct and easiest ways to connect to your greater Spirit-Self, and to access all that it has to offer you.<\/p> <p>By participating in these transformational group guided meditations, you\u2019ll experience how simple,delightful and easy it can be. You\u2019ll learn and practice:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Simple yet profound techniques you can easily do for yourself for any length of time that is comfortable for you.<\/p> <p>\u2022 How to easily get into a meditative state to deeply relax and to create positive, pleasurable feelings, including inner peace, love, ease and joy; and how to bring that into your daily living.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Techniques to help you release stress and anxiety, and to shift your perspective and experience of those issues to a more positive perspective, instead.<\/p> <p>\u2022 How to connect to your inner resources and your best self, to solution consciousness, and how to activate your body's natural healing response.<\/p> <p>We have a different theme each time we meet to help you build and reinforce positive thinking patterns, beliefs and inner narratives that will support you in living with greater inner peace, love, ease and joy.<\/p> <p>We typically have 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between to help you carry the positive feelings and lessons experienced into your day and life.<\/p> <p>This is a perfect time to let go of stress and \"busy-ness\", and to fully let go and relax into bliss. Come with whatever intentions suit you, and the evening is still sure to satisfy. It always works out magically that way.<\/p> <p>You're encouraged to bring a journal or notebook and pen to class.<\/p> <p>To encourage and support your practice, if you pay for 4 sessions, the fee will be only $60 (in-person, cash or check), to be used within 4 months of your payment.\u00a0 Or, you can pay for one class at a time for $20.\u00a0 Just RSVP each time you want to attend. RSVP is recommended and appreciated, as well as showing up or changing your RSVP in a timely manner.<\/p> <p>\u201cI'm leaving refreshed, optimistic, empowered, full of love, and excited about bringing more spirit into everything I do. I\u2019m sure that practicing the techniques I learned tonight will help me very much. Thank you!!! \"<\/p> <p>\"Great meditations! I had a marvelous experience with each of them and a lot to take with me: powerful imagery, good feelings, and new techniques for connecting myself with the Universe. Loved the \u201clove ripple\u201d!\u201d<\/p> <p>\"I truly value our time together. I tried two other guided meditation classes with other instructors, and I enjoy your classes the most. Why? Because you give us time to reflect, journal and share. It really helps to deepen my experience and expand my perspective.

Oprah has described this series as the very reason she founded a television network - to be able to share stories that connect people together.<\/p> <p>This series highlights stories of people from around the world, diverse in their beliefs, but united by a deep desire to find purpose and meaning in their lives. It journeys to the far reaches of the world, illuminating sacred places and practices that will engage believers of any faith or none at all.<\/p> <p>Our goal is that engaging in these questions and conversations together draws us to a place of deepened intercultural understanding and greater healing. Our hope is that this series can act as a catalyst to start and\/or deepen intercultural and interfaith communication, trust building and partnership.<\/p> <p>The gathering is free of charge. A facilitated discussion will follow the episode, inviting you to explore the beliefs and practices that bring meaning to your own life.<\/p> <p>For more information about the series, or to watch the 2-minute trailer, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbeliefteam.com%2F&amp;h=1AQF0J-76&amp;enc=AZPccVNw8moWSc-3VnxUkgkiHhDovkpfVDo3-bZZKYB0ZGXQhLHs1FDAsgv3Js0hOm4&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/beliefteam.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/beliefteam.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll be right in the sanctuary...come in through the large glass doors in the front of the spiritual center on 13 Common Street in Natick Center across from the town green.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center\/events\/226810802\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Community Watch Party: What Do You Believe?","id":"226810802","time":1452297600000,"updated":1452310084000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444180575000,"name":"Building Community @ Common Street Spiritual Center","group_lon":-71.3499984741,"id":19003287,"urlname":"Building-Community-Common-Street-Spiritual-Center","group_lat":42.2900009155,"who":"Community Builders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02109","country":"us","city":"Boston","address_1":"63 Chatham St","name":"The Wild Rover - by Faneuil Hall","lon":-71.053947,"id":14362052,"state":"MA","lat":42.359715,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":111,"distance":0.821387052536,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451228304000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>PLEASE DO NOT DOUBLE RSVP! ----PLEASE RSVP IN ONE GROUP ONLY!!\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/c\/1\/7\/600_438247191.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/4\/a\/event_190292842.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join the legendary crazy dancing at our Mix +Mingle Meetup Private Party for\u00a0120+ members with our own DJ,\u00a0dance area,\u00a02 bars\u00a0+apps\/food\u00a0from 7-9PM.<\/p> <p>7-9PM is\u00a0the Social Mixer which the best because it allows\u00a0you to get to know your fellow Meetup members.\u00a0After 9PM the crazy dancing + loud music starts so please do not complain, since members come to dance to loud music after 9PM.<\/p> <p>Bonus FREE <b>KARAOKE on 1st\u00a0 floor<\/b>\u00a0if you want to kick it KARAOKE style.<\/p> <p>Its the\u00a0party everyone loves since its\u00a0he starting point for thousands of new friendships,\u00a0real long term relationships and 57+ marriages.

We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive. How to get there: We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville. Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance. Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool. Practice will begin poolside at 9 am. Wear athletic clothing. Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet. Parking is free in the school parking lot. The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away. Practice will last an hour and 30 minutes. We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself! No paddling experience is required. We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know. We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.

In the collection\u2019s title story, a young woman adopted by an American family in Seattle receives a letter from Sister Mary Theresa, a nun at the Convent of Little Flowers in Chennai, where she stayed as a child. Unbeknownst to the Indian woman, the nun is her biological mother\u2019s sister. In another story, the grandmother of an Indian journalist begs her grandson to intervene and stop a young widow from being burned alive. And when a teenaged daughter bears a child out of wedlock, her entire family is thrown into turmoil. With their lush prose, vividly rendered settings, and complex characters, these and the other stories in this elegant collection bring readers into the experience of Indian women at home and abroad, where modernity offers them lives their grandmothers could never dream of, while at the same time taking away parts of their history. With a delicate touch, Indu Sundaresan weaves the pieces of the conflict together, presenting a nuanced and unforgettable tapestry.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Book on the table","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-1439\/events\/224564112\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":5400000,"name":"In the Convent of Little Flowers by Indu Sundaresan at Singh's Caf\u00e9, Wellesley","id":"224564112","time":1452358800000,"updated":1452366990000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1219087471000,"name":"Indian Food, Indian Fiction","group_lon":-71.2399978638,"id":1261834,"urlname":"bookclub-1439","group_lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Indian Bookwalas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02144","country":"us","city":"Somerville","phone":"Please Send Me A Message on Meet","address_1":"Davis Square","name":"Davis Square","lon":-71.122574,"id":735132,"state":"MA","lat":42.395359,"repinned":false},"headcount":1,"distance":3.63657283783,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451441013000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>***EVENT ON!***<\/p> <p>A nice low-key meetup to get everyone acquainted and get the blood flowing on these soon-to-be cold days.

The lower level bar is open on Friday and Saturday evenings and offers pool tables, Golden Tee golf, skee-ball and a jukebox.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tapbrewingcompany.com\/menu\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tapbrewingcompany.com\/menu\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.tapbrewingcompany.com\/menu\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/0\/5\/d\/600_445553341.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthShoreSocial\/events\/227163364\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Pre-NIB BS Fuel-up - The Tap Brewing Company - Haverhill","id":"227163364","time":1452382200000,"updated":1452394368000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372334526000,"name":"North Shore Social (NSS)","group_lon":-70.9400024414,"id":9114692,"urlname":"NorthShoreSocial","group_lat":42.5699996948,"who":"North Shore Socials"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02140","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","phone":"617-354-7766","address_1":"1815 Massachusetts Ave.","name":"Tavern in the Square - Porter","lon":-71.118996,"id":859456,"state":"MA","lat":42.387146,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":3.13267660141,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":12,"created":1447346189000,"fee":{"amount":1,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>En se rencontre le samedi soir cette semaine!<\/p> <p>Voulez-vous meetup: le samedi soir au\u00a0Tavern in the Square\u00a0dans Porter Square, Cambridge.

Michael Spencer<\/p> <p>Musical Guest: Amanda McCarthy<\/p> <p><br\/>About our featured speaker:<\/p> <p>Shortly after obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in pastoral studies, Helen Stringer came to realize she could no longer support any religious ideologies. She redirected her passion for community and helping others by working as a center director and counselor for a local nonprofit that assists young families in crisis. Simultaneously, she completed her master\u2019s degree in human services with a graduate certificate in professional counseling.<\/p> <p>Now, Helen is bringing her training and passion for community to Oasis with a desire to bring together secular individuals and families who don\u2019t fit in church. In early 2014, she founded and now serves as the executive director of Kansas City Oasis, a secular alternative to faith-based community. She also co-founded and serves as the president of the Oasis Network, the affiliate organization that helps to launch and support Oasis communities around the country.<\/p> <p>\n\n\"The Rationalist's Delusion- An Introduction to Moral Psychology\"<\/p> <p>Based on Johnathan Haidt's book \"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion\", Helen Stringer will share some of the most recent research in moral psychology and help the audience rethink just how reasonable they really are.<\/p> <p>=========================================<\/p> <p>Oasis meets in the Teen Center at the YMCA. To find the room, enter through the lower entrance (on Dartmouth Street, by the swimming pool), and follow Oasis signs from the front lobby to the Teen Center on the second floor. (Note: the stairwell to the Teen Center is NOT the stairwell in the front lobby. That is Stairwell A. The Teen Center is located at Stairwell B, next to the Yoga Studio. Oasis volunteers will be available to help provide assistance, and signage will be posted.<\/p> <p>=========================================<\/p> <p>Greater Boston Oasis is a secular community dedicated to providing for the human need for social and intellectual community, for those people who may not want or be able to have those needs met in a church or other faith-based community.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\nOur Core Values are:<\/p> <p>People are more important than beliefs<\/p> <p>Reality is known through reason<\/p> <p>Meaning comes from making a difference<\/p> <p>Human hands solve human problems<\/p> <p>Be accepting, and be accepted<\/p> <p><br\/>Atheist or agnostic, freethinker or skeptic, deist or theist, all those with whom those values resonate are welcome to celebrate the human experience.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Follow signs from the entrance to the Teen Center room. Use the Dartmouth Street entrance, and head to Stairwell B. Teen Center is on the 2nd floor.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Greater-Boston-Oasis-Meetup\/events\/227280018\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Weekly Sunday Gathering - Helen Stringer: The Rationalist's Delusion","id":"jxjnmlyvcbnb","time":1452438000000,"updated":1452450473000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1425262966000,"name":"Greater Boston Oasis Meetup","group_lon":-71.1100006104,"id":18470516,"urlname":"Greater-Boston-Oasis-Meetup","group_lat":42.4199981689,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Hudson","address_1":"582 Main Street","name":"Regina's Connection","lon":-71.49984,"id":21872462,"state":"MA","lat":42.392548,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.0998897552,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449349169000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Want to join our book club?

These two opposing philosophies may echo a moral conflict taking place in Greene\u2019s own mind.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Classic-Indie-Movie-Group\/events\/227779977\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":6300000,"name":"The Third Man at the MFA","id":"227779977","time":1452447000000,"updated":1453256858000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377119802000,"name":"Classic\/Indie Movie Group","group_lon":-71.1299972534,"id":9913112,"urlname":"Classic-Indie-Movie-Group","group_lat":42.3800010681,"who":"Cinephiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02142","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"21 Ames St (Bldg 56), room 180","name":"MIT Whitaker Building","lon":-71.088173,"id":13092242,"state":"MA","lat":42.362438,"repinned":false},"headcount":13,"distance":0.945005595684,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451598838000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We will be discussing <b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scottaaronson.com\/democritus\/lec6.html\">Lecture 6: \"P, NP, and Friends\"<\/a><\/b>, from Scott Aaronson's lectures on quantum computing.

The moment I had this book in my hands, I couldn't wait to get in the kitchen and play with the recipes. The only problem was, there was no one else to enjoy the food with me! Sadly, my husband didn't share the same enthusiasm for such gorgeous vegetarian recipes.<\/p> <p><br\/>A cookbook like this needs to be celebrated with the right people. It exudes inspiration and creativity on every page. I couldn't ask for a better group of home cooks to experience this book with. Plus, after the holiday season, I figured a vegetarian cookbook would be a refreshing choice for us. Get ready for yet another amazing feast!<\/p> <p><br\/>Join me and your fellow cookbook collectors for our 4th feast! You can order the cookbook <b><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1IYJJzx\">online<\/a><\/b> or see if a local retailer has a copy. <b>Note<\/b> :: You don't have to buy a copy of the cookbook in order to participate in our events\u2014email me and I'll hook you up.

Join our Meetup group! All cooking levels are welcome. Don't be shy.<\/p> <p>2. RSVP via Meetup. <b>Note<\/b> :: Each of our \"feast\" events will happen the 1st Sunday of every month (except for January 2016, obviously), focusing on a different cookbook, and hosted at a new location in the North Shore. Everything will be organized by me, but you're more than welcome to offer suggestions of some of your favorite cookbooks.<\/p> <p>3. Grab yourself a copy of the featured cookbook<b> (ask your library, borrow from a friend, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1IYJJzx\">order online<\/a> or purchase at a local retailer)<\/b> and experiment with a few of the recipes.<\/p> <p>4. Pick 1 recipe that you will make for the event. Be sure to read through all of the instructions to make sure you have the proper tools, dishes, and ingredients. (I made that mistake at the last feast.)<\/p> <p><br\/>5. In the <b>comments section<\/b> below, share which recipe you will be bringing. I'll keep track of what everyone is bringing and make sure we don't have any overlaps. <b>Note<\/b> :: It might be wise to pick a backup recipe in case your 1st choice is already taken.<\/p> <p>6. Day of the event. Prepare your recipe according to the directions provided in the cookbook. Source ingredients locally, if you can. As tempting as it might be to alter the recipe or make a substitution, please follow the instructions as closely as possible. This will allow the group to truly experience the author's array of recipes. I'll bring salt + pepper, just in case (thanks Barbara for the suggestion).<\/p> <p><br\/>7. Come to the event with an open mind and empty stomach! Together we will feast on your wonderful food and share our experiences with one another. Bring your cookbook in order to highlight certain pages or make notes on recipes you especially loved. Post-it notes and pencils are provided.<\/p> <p>8. If you feel inspired to bring fancier serving dishes (for the photos), I won't stop you! But it's not essential . . . just more fun.<\/p> <p>9. Don't forget to bring a few small containers to take home leftovers.

Go out of your comfort zone. Try a new technique or work with ingredients you've never used before.

There's no guarantee your dish will remain HOT by the time we are ready to eat. Consider recipes that not only travel well, but also can be served at room temperature. Either way, you're welcome to bring your own heating elements, crock pots, or warmers. I just can't guarantee there will always be an outlet accessible.<\/p> <p><br\/>3.

Widely recognized as one of the finest musical ensembles in the country, the Boychoir performs regularly with world-class musical ensembles, including the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The American Boychoir is the cornerstone of the American Boychoir School (\u201cABS\u201d), one of a small handful of boychoir schools in this country, and the only one committed to a national touring program.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.

The meditation, based on Kriya practices, \u00a0is partly guided, partly silent. In the guided part we open up to the flow of golden light and energy that is always pouring down to our body\/mind\/heart and being. Accessing that flow and inviting it to fill us brings a profound level of openness, while washing away limiting thoughts, feelings and beliefs. This higher vibration of unconditional love serves to open our consciousness to new levels of peace, joy and awakening. Bringing the flow of light into the body\/mind\/heart means we more consciously embody our Light Being, so we are more present, happy, forgiving, peaceful and joyful while in the world.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0After the guided portion we\u00a0spend time\u00a0in peaceful silence.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are an experienced meditator or a beginner, you will love the sweetness and powerful energies of this group. At the end of the class we make time for questions or sharing. \u00a0Group meditation is powerful, and it's refreshing to be among fellow travelers!<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Judy also teaches the Sound and Light meditation; a way for you to draw your senses inward to open your spiritual eye and to hear the sounds of your chakras.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0Held in a lovely healing space, just walking in will bring you instant peace.\u00a0 All are welcome.<br\/>\u00a0 \u00a0 You may also want to check out my other Meetup, for a variety of spiritual programs: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Evolving-Beings<\/a><\/a>\/<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter at The Hawthorne Building, the large glass doors to the left of H&R Block.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group\/events\/227536284\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":4500000,"name":"The Salem MA Weekly Meditation Group","id":"dfdktkyvcbnb","time":1452463200000,"updated":1453491580000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1232459353000,"name":"The Salem MA Meditation Meetup Group","group_lon":-70.9000015259,"id":1362498,"urlname":"The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group","group_lat":42.5200004578,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"02129","country":"us","city":"Cambridge","address_1":"45 Prospect St, Central Square","name":"Workbar Cambridge","lon":-71.058311,"id":13528122,"state":"MA","lat":42.376041,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.26123464108,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451924870000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>At 5PM we'll talk through how we built some of our recent NFL and NBA data viz for the Stattleship blog and give you tips for playing with stats.\u00a0<\/p> <p>At 6PM we'll throw on the Celtics &amp; Grizzlies game and try some live stat analysis.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

(See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>PLEASE<\/b> <b>REMEMBER:<\/b><br\/><i>* We run 3-5 Meetup Groups, plus maintain our own outside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">Dating Advice &amp; Events Website.<\/a> We advertise on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, etc. Most registrations come through our outside events website, not Meetup.
