I believe what I am doing is good and what I am standing up against is evil.\u201d What could possibly unite Foley, a vigilante with a paramilitary group who routinely thwarts Mexican immigrants, with a freedom fighter in Mexico? A shared enemy: the cartels. In the Mexican state of Michoaca\u0301n, Dr. Jose Mireles, a small-town physician known as \u201cEl Doctor,\u201d leads the Autodefensas, a citizen uprising against the violent Knights Templar drug cartel that has wreaked havoc on the region for years. Filmmaker Matthew Heineman embeds himself in the heart of darkness as Nailer, El Doctor, and the cartel each vie to bring their own brand of justice to a society where institutions have failed.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>TRAILER <\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZoSFSiLgbdI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZoSFSiLgbdI<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Reception &amp; Film Location<\/b><\/p> <p>This event\u00a0is General Admission (open seating) and takes place inside the Jared L.

Yay! Join other cyclists in your community on this scenic, moderately challenging ride. Average pace is 14-16 miles per hour with a ride duration of approximately 1 hour. The intermediate route includes light urban riding, local bike paths, and residential riding. We tackle hills as they come and include at least one more challenging climb (read: over 1 mile in length). The Intermediate Ride provides an opportunity to meet new riding partners, share and build knowledge, and get a workout. This is a no-drop ride. Seasoned and very fit riders can increase ride difficulty by getting out of the saddle on climbs, as well as by down-shifting and spinning at higher cadence to build muscle suppleness. Rides start and end at the shop.

Requiem For the American Dream provides a unique opportunity to introduce Chomsky to a broader audience and to widen the discussion regarding events that deeply impact all of our lives. It\u2019s an eye-opening vision of the American Dream and one not to be missed.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>TRAILER <\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zI_Ik7OppEI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zI_Ik7OppEI<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Reception &amp; Film Location<\/b><\/p> <p>This event\u00a0is General Admission (open seating) and takes place inside the Jared L.

Even after two hundred years, it remains an extremely popular work that is frequently performed and appears 8th on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide.<\/p> <p><br\/>Rossini\u2019s madcap comedy is guaranteed to send you out laughing and\u00a0humming a tune.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Count Almaviva is in love with the beautiful Rosina. Rosina is essentially being held captive by the slimy Bartolo, who wants to marry her himself. With the help of the barber Figaro, Almaviva and Rosina attempt to outwit Bartolo and live happily ever after.<\/p> <p><br\/>While the original popular romantic comedy was based on an 18th-century play set in Seville, Spain, the new look for <a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburghopera.org\/\"> Pittsburgh Opera's <\/a>production will update the story by staging it in the Hollywood era around 1950.<\/p> <p>THE BARBER OF SEVILLE\u00a0is the perfect introductory opera. It features\u00a0recognizable music, comedic staging, fun costumes and a happy ending.<\/p> <p><br\/>But THE BARBER OF SEVILLE\u00a0will be LARGER THAN LIFE because of the amazing ensemble cast - which includes two former Resident Artists with tremendous personalities, Kevin Glavin and Jonathan Beyer - and the Pittsburgh debut of Michele Angelini, who has received superlative reviews around the world in his role.

We'll start by focusing on the five basic variables to consider when building a first-aid kit: group size, trip length and distance, potential injuries and illnesses, specific medical conditions and your own medical knowledge and skills. Plus, we'll discuss the benefits of assemble-it-yourself first-aid kits vs. pre-assembled kits. You'll also participate in a hands-on, small-group discussion of the contents needed for a first-aid kit based on three different outing scenarios. You'll assess the needs of each kit based on the first three basic variables outlined earlier in the clinic. Afterwards, the whole group will come together to discuss what first-aid materials would be needed for each scenario. Our experts will also briefly explain the purpose for each item in the kit. They also discuss where it should be placed, so it can be quickly located during stressful emergency situations. Please note: This is not a first-aid certification class. Proper first-aid training is very important for knowing what to do in emergency situations. You should only attempt first aid when you feel comfortable giving it.<\/p> <p><br\/>Thank you for your interest in our free \"First Aid Kits\u00a0Clinic.\" L.L.Bean has a <b>centralized reservation system<\/b>.

You'll get a ton of playing time in a well-organized event. Our host will check players in, divide players into teams, and make sure that everything runs smoothly. All you have to do is show up ready to play!<\/p> <p><b>Pricing:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$7 - RSVP online and pay in advance because you know you are attending. (online rsvp closes at 4:30 pm!)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$8.50 - RSVP and pay 50 cents via PayPal and $8 cash at the event if you are pretty sure you are attending (note the 50 cents is non-refundable)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$10 - Show up and play - be sure to check online to make sure there is room!<\/p> <p><b>What to Wear:<\/b> We are playing indoors on a rubberized all-sport surface. Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply. You can also message the organizers directly through meetup. Or, give us a call M-F 8:00am-12:30pm:[masked]-7130.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Check in with monitor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghvolleyballclub\/events\/229726121\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Tuesdays Pick Up Volleyball @ Monroeville Sports Center","id":"khlzrlyvgbhb","time":1459900800000,"updated":1459909807000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329330602000,"name":"Pittsburgh Volleyball Club","group_lon":-79.7600021362,"id":3299762,"urlname":"pittsburghvolleyballclub","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Volleyball Monsters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15219","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"225 Station Square","lon":-80.003711,"phone":"412-232-3101","name":"Buckhead Saloon","id":858565,"state":"PA","lat":40.432542,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.83878779411,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445526370000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>NO COVER CHARGE, NO DRINK MINIMUM, $6, $10 and $14 Beer Bucket Specials During The Show, $1 Captain Morgans and $1 Miller Lite Drafts 10-12 ....

This presentation will introduce the concept of foraging for food and medicine as one of the easiest and most effective ways to solidify this lasting connection. \u00a0Adam will also discuss the work he is doing with LearnYourLand.com \u2014 an online database and community of Pennsylvania's naturalists, nature organizations, state parks, and environmental centers.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Schedule:\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><br\/>5:30 \u2013 6 p.m. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Networking and refreshments\u00a0<br\/>6 \u2013 6:30 p.m. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Presentation\u00a0<br\/>6:30 \u2013 7:30 p.m.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Discussion<\/p> <p><b>Directions and Parking:\u00a0<\/b><br\/>This meeting will take place in the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) Classroom which is located on the facility\u2019s first floor.

Here are the details: So many of you are sending me notes of chronic grief lately. I want to share something that is precious to me with you. A few years ago, deep in grief and in prayer, I had a series of meditations come to me, along with a few teachings about valor, courage, and compassion. I want to share these with you, because they have been the singular most powerful thing in my life when coping with the sort of grief you learn to live with.<\/p> <p>We will open this event with meeting one another and sharing our stories. You do not have to share anything you do not want to. We will then discuss the differences of valor, courage, and compassion, and how to express these to each other and to ourselves. I will share the meditations with you. We will have time to talk and share experiences, and opportunities to get to the root cause of feelings such as anger, guilt or sadness in order to resolve them, and to work with the love that never dies within each of us. We will use any number and combination of therapeutic techniques to help the group, but this will be entirely dependent on what is needed by the people there. I also will share with you some of the things I have learned working with Horse and Turtle, to provide imagery and metaphors you can draw on later in your own healing work. We will also be discussing water in the body and the emotional self, and how to get water on your side to assist your healing work.<\/p> <p>There will be a small space for you to release things you are ready to release. For those of you not quite ready to truly let go, there will be grief stones for you to work with and release whenever you are ready, whether at the event or at another time.<\/p> <p>If you are grieving a loved one\u2019s passing, please feel free to bring a photo of them or another personal object that is connected to them with you. We will create a small space for photos of those whom we\u2019ve lost where we will light vigil candles to welcome their memory and spirit into our space. All forms of grief are welcome, and the grief does not need to be connected to death. If there is another personal object that connects you to what you are grieving over, please feel welcome to bring it.<\/p> <p>At the end of the event, we will have a moment to thank each other, speak to how we benefited from the event, and share something that gives us hope. By then, we will have the companionship of shared experiences and support, which will enable us to share hope with each other.<\/p> <p>I want you to feel safe, accepted, heard, and supported in this event, but above all else, I want you to leave feeling loved and resilient. We are limited in space, and I want to make sure you have the comfortable space you need, so we are limiting this event to seven people. Thus, prepayment is required. The cost of the event is $25. You may paypal a payment to [masked], or simply send me your name and email address and I will send you an invoice that can be paid either by card or by paypal.<\/p> <p>Feel free to bring something to write on if taking notes or writing out feelings is helpful for you, and feel free to bring any items of comfort you may want for the meditations such as a pillow or a blanket. I will be playing flute and water music, and I will be diffusing oils that are appropriate. If you have any allergies and are RSVPing, please alert me so I may make an appropriate blend.<\/p> <p>Because these are small groups, we are having two to help as many as possible. The same event is on April 7th and April 21st.<\/p> <p>Love to you and I hope to see you there.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/229855448\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Wind and water: Healing chronic grief through compassion, valor, and courage","id":"229855448","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460079088000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15216","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"2950 W Liberty Ave  Pittsburgh, PA 15216","name":"Dormont Library","lon":-80.035957,"id":16440832,"state":"PA","lat":40.394169,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.93455410004,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1433716589000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a traditional Hatha class taught with a vinyasa flow.

Not only \u201cbrainiacs\u201d but also normal youth, citizens split in half, divided between a life with greater possibilities abroad but with the homesickness and frustration that every ex-pat has,\u00a0even those who left voluntarily. The documentary reports what the young Italians living abroad do, think, dream, whether they will remain or return, and if leaving is really the emergency exit to change their uncertain future. A trip from Vienna to Paris, Tenerife, Bergen, London and New York; six stories of ordinary separation, one theme: that of a forgotten generation that has something to say to their home country.Director:Brunella Fil\u00ecCast:Bill Emmott, Patrizia Pierazzo, Chiara Capraro, Mauro Gargano, Milena Maselli, Nicola Cataldo, Anna Binetti, Marco Lanza, Camilla Bonetti, Walter Calvaresi, Martina Zipoli, Alessia Gatti, Andrea Lodovichetti, Chiara Bernasconi, Matteo RignaneseYear:2014Length:66 min.Genre:Documentary<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/f\/5\/600_447934805.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u202c<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers\/events\/229821719\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"name":"ITALIAN FILM FESTIVAL  - \"Emergency Exit\" (Italian with English subtitles)","id":"229821719","time":1460070000000,"updated":1460086683000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1047114201000,"name":"MONDO ITALIANO: Pittsburgh Italian Meetup","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":85432,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Italian-Speakers","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Italian Speakers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15228","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"799 Washington Rd","name":"Southminster Presbyterian Church","lon":-80.04573,"id":24330334,"state":"PA","lat":40.37778,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.13809776306,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454101814000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Pittsburgh Change Ringing Guild meets regularly on Thursday nights to practice and hone our change ringing skills.<\/p> <p>Non-ringers are welcome to attend Thursday night practices to come check out what we do. \u00a0When entering the tower, the most important rule is <b>DO NOT<\/b> touch the ropes unless specifically instructed to by an experienced bell ringer. \u00a0If people are currently ringing the bells when you walk in the room, please come in quietly and have a seat around the edges of the room. \u00a0We will stop ringing in a few minutes, and can give you an introduction to the bells.<\/p> <p>Non-Ringers can also have an opportunity to try pulling the bell under the guidance of an experienced bell ringer. \u00a0We are also more than happy to teach you the ancient art of bell ringing.<br\/>Learning to ring the bells does take some time before you would be able to ring comfortably on your own. \u00a0Obviously the more effort you put into it the more quickly you would be able to ring confidently on your own. \u00a0You can expect 4-6 weeks of individual instruction to get to that stage. \u00a0And then once you learn how to handle the bells, that opens up a lifetime of ringing opportunities!<\/p> <p>Check out the videos below to see what the bell ringing is like, and you are more than welcome to come join us for our practice night! \u00a0Please RSVP if you are coming, because practices sometimes get cancelled for various reasons.<\/p> <p>Bells swinging:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/>Ringers pulling ropes:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI<\/a><\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Southminster church by the doors between the church and the middle school.

Even after two hundred years, it remains an extremely popular work that is frequently performed and appears 8th on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide.<\/p> <p><br\/>Rossini\u2019s madcap comedy is guaranteed to send you out laughing and\u00a0humming a tune.<\/p> <p><br\/>Count Almaviva is in love with the beautiful Rosina. Rosina is essentially being held captive by the slimy Bartolo, who wants to marry her himself. With the help of the barber Figaro, Almaviva and Rosina attempt to outwit Bartolo and live happily ever after.<\/p> <p><br\/>While the original popular romantic comedy was based on an 18th-century play set in Seville, Spain, the new look for <a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburghopera.org\/\"> Pittsburgh Opera's <\/a>production will update the story by staging it in the Hollywood era around 1950.<\/p> <p>THE BARBER OF SEVILLE\u00a0is the perfect introductory opera. It features\u00a0recognizable music, comedic staging, fun costumes and a happy ending.<\/p> <p>But THE BARBER OF SEVILLE\u00a0will be LARGER THAN LIFE because of the amazing ensemble cast - which includes two former Resident Artists with tremendous personalities, Kevin Glavin and Jonathan Beyer - and the Pittsburgh debut of Michele Angelini, who has received superlative reviews around the world in his role.

It is an activity that merges both physical and mental activities. There will be courses for beginners, intermediate, advanced. Fee per map is $6.

Courses close at 3:30, time when volunteers begin the tear-down of the courses. Participants can do more than one course if they wish: for example start with a beginner and then try an intermediate. Course length varies from 2 to 7 km. Bring clothing and footwear for the outdoors. Event happens regardless of weather, rain or shine.<\/p> <p>Meet start is at shelter #5.

The courses will offer good opportunities to avoid the thick vegetation that covers parts of the park.<br\/>As usual, registration and starts are from 11 am to 2 pm. Member map fee is $5 (all others is $6). Driving directions are below. For more information, go to www.wpoc.org<br\/>Don't forget, if you are bringing a minor who is not your son or daughter, you need to bring a waiver signed by the minor's parent (obtainable under Club Documents at www.wpoc.org ).<br\/>I hope many of you will venture to Washington Co. and join the fun.<br\/>Jim<br\/>---------------There are many ways to reach Mingo Creek Park. The preferred ways involve using Sichi Hill Rd, Chapel Hill Rd (best choice), or Mansion Hill Rd from PA route 136 and coming into the park from the south to reach Mingo Creek Rd. Note: Mansion Hill Rd ends by crossing a covered bridge; Chapel Hill Rd ends by crossing a regular bridge; and from Sichi Hill Rd you need to bear right onto Sugar Run Rd briefly and then turn right into the park. The event is at shelter #5 about half way between where Chapel Hill Rd and Sichi Hill Rd reach Mingo Creek Rd. There are signs giving directions to each shelter in the park. There will also be red and white orienteering signs showing the way from the Mingo Creek Rd\/Chapel Hill Rd intersection.Here are some suggested approaches to route 136.From Pittsburgh, go south on PA route 51 or PA route 88 or US route 19. On route 51, go south past Jefferson Hills to the end of Turnpike 43 (exit 54), enter theTurnpike and go south to exit 44 (route 136). Follow 136 west past Ginger Hill to one of the three streets mentioned above; turn right and enter the park. There is a toll for using Turnpike 43. On route 88, go south past Bethel Park and Finleyville until you cross under Turnpike 43, then bear right onto Gearing Rd. After about 0.5 miles, turn right onto route 136. Follow 136 west past Ginger Hill to one of the three streets mentioned above; turn right and enter the park. The map shows another possible route using Venetia Rd, Sugar Run Rd, and Park View Rd from Finleyville. On route 19, go south past Upper St. Clair and Murry Hill to route 519. Turn left on route 519 and follow it 6 miles south to the town of Eighty Four and route 136. Follow 136 east to one of the three streets mentioned above, turn left and enter the park.From the northwest, follow I-79 south past Canonsburg to exit 43. There, take route 519 south 7 miles to the town of Eighty Four and route 136. Follow 136 east to one of the three streets mentioned above, turn left and enter the park.From the west, follow I-70 east to esit 25. There, take route 519 north 2 miles to the town of Eighty Four and route 136. Follow 136 east to one of the three streets mentioned above, turn left and enter the park.From the east, follow I-70 to exit 32A (route 917), follow that five miles north to route 136. Follow 136 west past Ginger Hill to one of the three streets mentioned above; turn right and enter the park. You can save about 5 minutes (at the cost of $0.70) by taking exit 37 from I-70 and following Turnpike 43 north nine miles to exit 44.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/230197186\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":17100000,"name":"map and compass hiking at Mingo Creek park","id":"230197186","time":1460299500000,"updated":1460378607000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Allison Park ","address_1":"302 Pearce Mill Road","name":"North Park Off Leash Play Area ","lon":-80.00699,"id":24444197,"lat":40.606033,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.88414287567,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458420801000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hopefully we can avoid the April showers and let these Frenchies play outside!

There's an interpreter (or 3), a tactic compiler, a tactic engine, various compilers for code extraction, and dozens of other subsystems underlying a modern proof assistant. In this talk we'll walk through a very simple proof assistant called miniprl to see how some of these components might be implemented.<\/p> <p>Participants are expected to know a bit about (statically typed) functional programming to follow along with the code but since this is mostly a talk about implementation, we'll avoid any heavy dependencies on dependent type theory or similar. By the end, you will hopefully be in a much better position to learn an industrial strength proof assistant or even write your own toy versions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup\/events\/229673864\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Building a Proof Assistant","id":"gctsjlyvgbpb","time":1460415600000,"updated":1460466509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434587372000,"name":"Pittsburgh Functional Programming Meetup","group_lon":-79.9499969482,"id":18680854,"urlname":"Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup","group_lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Lambdistas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"Boyce Road","name":"Boyce Mayview Park","lon":-80.139343,"id":24459129,"state":"PA","lat":40.431568,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":10.3244657516,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459685834000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>If you've never explored the Morton Valley Trail in Boyce-Mayview Park, you'll be in for a treat! \u00a0It's beautiful to walk through and has been rated one of the best walking trails in the city! \u00a0 We will walk at a slow to moderate pace for about an hour. \u00a0Wear waterproof hiking shoes\/ boots and dress accordingly to walking on trails that may be a bit muddy. \u00a0Bring a water bottle and snack if you'd like. \u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nDirections from US Rt. 19 (Washington Road)<\/p> <p><br\/>Proceed south on US Rt. 19 (Washington Road) to Boyce Road which is 3.0 miles south of South Hills Village Shopping Center (at Ft.

We request a $5 donation from those who can give to cover costs of the meetup, but you are more than welcome to come even if you are unable to donate. Each month we set an alter, welcome in the energies, share a journey, and release the energy. You are welcome to participate in the journey planned or to do your own journey work during the time we are journeying as a group. After the journey we have a quiet time for people to record their experiences if they choose to do so and then you are given an opportunity to share if you would like to (sharing is never required). You are recommended to have basic journey skills prior to the meetup as this is not a 101 class (if you would like to host a 101 class, get in touch with me to arrange it!).<\/p> <p>The space is set, cleansed and protected before people arrive. You will be given a blessing and cleansing when you arrive prior to entering the space. Then the schedule proceeds as follows:<\/p> <p>7pm door opens. If you come between 7:10 and 7:35 please wait in the waiting area while we build the alter.<\/p> <p>7-7:25 alter building (feel free to bring something that reflects one of the elements or your ancestors if you wish to)<\/p> <p>7:35 Door is locked, first journey starts<\/p> <p>7:35-8:30, however many journeys the group feels like doing that fits in the time span. We occasionally go longer until 9, but you will be welcome to pass on from the group at a break at 8:30 if we choose to do this and you have that need.<\/p> <p>I am again going to diffuse appropriate oils for this meetup as it is still a bit dry for the smoke and folks are really lovin' on the oils! If you have an allergy or sensitivity, please let me know so I can plan accordingly.<\/p> <p>This day on the Aztec calendar combines the energy of rabbit and death. Of course, on European calendars, this is a time of water and the sacrificed guide. For Christian teachings, the time of Christ's sacrifice is just passing over (the date of the \"last supper\" on the Jewish calendar this year is May 23, which celebrates the memorial of the Passover, another time of sacrifice and death for the fertility and prosperity of a people). You see how the energies across the world are recognizing the same cycles.<\/p> <p>The energy on this a perfect time to explore our own personal mythos around sacrifice for the greater good and the religious idea that holding something sacred can result in spiritual experiences of self-transcendence. It is also a strong day for water and moon energy, which is useful for communicating with nature, the cycles of time, seasons and energy, and spiritually transformative forces.<\/p> <p>I'm really looking forward to exploring this energy with you.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

Everyone has automatic impulses to brace against, resist, or tense to pain on a physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual level.\u00a0 This \"tensing to\" and \"resisting\" pain helps us to initially survive; however, over time as you continue to avoid your pain, you struggle to heal and grow.\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is counter-intuitive to embrace and accept your pain, and Amy proposes that learning how to safely experience your pain is what affords you the deepest growth. Your pain is worthy of being revered, honored, and held with care, compassion, and love. When you learn to honor your Sacred Pain in this way, you afford yourself the gifts of peace, healing, love, compassion, and wisdom. Ultimately, it is through your deepest, darkest, scariest experiences that you have the opportunity to experience the most significant growth.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Amy will demonstrate creating a vessel for <i>her<\/i> Sacred Pain \u2013 a safe, sacred space where pain can be felt and experienced. Through sharing her story of adversity and resiliency, in passion and strength, you will observe the embodiment of Radical Acceptance with pain (the practice of mindfulness &amp; compassion). A seminar that will empower and inspire you to practice the same skills with your Sacred Pain, and ultimately afford you the chance at deeper growth and healing.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~<\/p> <p><br\/><i><b>Stay tuned<\/b><\/i> for additional seminars related to the concept of Sacred Pain, Mindfulness, Wellness, Spirituality &amp; More!

Learning Reiki involves an energy activation process called an \u201cattunement\u201d which is performed by the Reiki Master with each student. Through this initiation ceremony students are opened to the flow of Reiki energy which provides an energetic shift, causing healing energies and intuitive insights to emerge. The initiation opens innate healing channels, enabling students to immediately tap into the flow of Reiki energy and perform healing sessions. In addition to learning the Reiki method of healing, students also experience an acceleration in their spiritual awareness and intuitive abilities as a direct result of the Reiki initiation. After learning Reiki, students report having increased energy, self-awareness, personal charisma, peace, and compassion.<\/p> <p>Topics covered in Reiki Level I :<br\/>\u2022 What is Reiki and how the Reiki energy works<br\/>\u2022 The history of Reiki<br\/>\u2022 How to channel Reiki energy for self-healing and the healing of others<br\/>\u2022 Hand positions for self-healing and healing others<br\/>\u2022 Self-healing techniques for expanding personal awareness and accelerating well-being<br\/>\u2022 Hands-on practice both giving and receiving Reiki sessions<br\/>\u2022 Reiki and spiritual growth Class Duration: 7 hours<\/p> <p>Reiki, The Healing Touch I and II manual by William Rand is included in the price which is a $20 value.

The words roll across the screen in ornate, flaming letters \u2013 in fact, The Case of the Three Sided Dream regularly presents such text fragments graphically on the screen.<\/p> <p>During long improvisations, Rahsaan\u2013the name came to him in a dream \u2013 sometimes played three wind instruments at the same time, including with his nose. He was blinded by eye drops shortly after he was born, although he referred to himself as \u201ca man that doesn\u2019t see too well.\u201d But he was blessed with a silver tongue; a fellow musician noted that, when onstage, Rahsaan liked to talk to the audience, more so than the other masters of jazz \u2013 a genre Rahsaan referred to as \u201cblack classical music.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>The life story of this exceptional man is told by members of Rahsaan\u2019s entourage, including colleagues, his widow and his son. Their stories are interspersed with short animations and archive footage, including from the Ed Sullivan Show and the Montreux Jazz Festival. In this way, we get a virtuoso portrait of a contrary figure: a fanatical collector of animal sounds, believer in an eccentric \u201creligion of dreams\u201d and champion of civil rights for African Americans \u2013 which resulted in the composition of a piece of music called \"Blacknuss\" that only uses the black piano keys.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/229965825\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":10800000,"name":"Rahsaan Roland Kirk: The Case of the Three-Sided Dream Screens April 16th","id":"229965825","time":1460831400000,"updated":1460843492000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15222","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"612 Smithfield Street","name":"Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Downtown & Business Branch","lon":-79.99752,"id":17012432,"state":"PA","lat":40.44175,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.17702293396,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458663809000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us as Hiroya Tsukamoto, a guitarist and composer originally from Kyoto, Japan, takes us on an innovative, impressionistic journey filled with earthy, organic soundscapes that impart a mood of peace and tranquility.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/229789280\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":5400000,"name":"Music @ the Library: Hiroya Tsukamoto","id":"229789280","time":1460831400000,"updated":1460838085000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"708 Brookline Blvd","name":"Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Brookline","lon":-80.021233,"id":23816800,"lat":40.394665,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":6.42650222778,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458453999000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Cross-posted to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-anxiety-shyness-depression\/\">Pittsburgh area anxiety, shyness and depression meetup<\/a>\u00a0group.<\/p> <p>April's library talk at the Brookline library will be 90 minutes and in the larger conference room.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Paid parking is enforced on Brookline Blvd on Saturdays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there!

Vegan food and drinks will be available for purchase from Mixtape.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>\u201cJasmin\u2019s story is an inspiration to create your best self and your best life.\u201d \u2014 Neal Barnard, M.D. New York Times bestselling author of Power Foods for the Brain<\/p> <p>\u201c[Singer] rigorously examines attitudes toward people battling obesity with compassion, insight and understanding.\u201d \u2014 Joe Cross, filmmaker of Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead<\/p> <p>About ALWAYS TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH:<br\/>Jasmin Singer\u2019s struggle with weight defined her life. From the extra pounds and unrelenting bullies that left Jasmin Singer eating lunch alone in a bathroom stall at school, to the low self-esteem that left her both physically and emotionally vulnerable, Jasmin spent her younger years feeling completely lost.<\/p> <p>Most people think there\u2019s no such thing as a fat vegan. Most people don\u2019t realize that deep-fried tofu tastes amazing and that Oreos are, in fact, vegan. So, even after Jasmin discovered her passion in advocating for the rights of animals, she defied any \u201cskinny vegan\u201d stereotypes by getting even heavier. More importantly, she realized that her compassion for others didn\u2019t extend to her own body, and that her low self-esteem was affecting her health. She needed a change.<\/p> <p>Told with humble humor and heartbreaking honesty, ALWAYS TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH: A Memoir (Berkley Trade Paperback Original; February 2, 2016; $16.00) is Jasmin\u2019s story of how she went from a bullied kid who found solace in a box of cheese crackers to becoming an empowered activist and finding peace with herself, her body, and her sexuality.<\/p> <p>By committing to monthly juice fasts and a diet of whole, unprocessed foods, Jasmin lost almost a hundred pounds, gained an understanding of her destructive relationship with food, and even learned some hard truths about how intensely our society values thinness.<\/p> <p>In a relatable memoir about finding one\u2019s true identity and what that really means, Jasmin Singer\u2019s debut is a raw and powerful account of self-realization. Above all ALWAYS TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH is an inspiration to create one\u2019s best self.<\/p> <p><br\/>About Jasmin:<br\/>Jasmin Singer is the executive director of Our Hen House, a non-profit organization aiming to change the world for animals.

We will cover ongoing topics of metaphysics, and really anything that could be regarded as existing outside of objective reality, and seeks to investigate the nature of reality. Big words, but true. Simply put, the groups' questioning and desires to know the things that are hard to explain will define what each new topic is each month. So, as the group grows so do the topics.<\/p> <p>This group is democratic where everyone is encouraged to join in the conversation, anyone can bring a gift to share--be it intuition, Reiki, dream work and lucid dreaming, numerology, astrology, Ascension, Enlightenment, meditation, visualization, channeling, archetypes, Angels, manifestation, Indigo Children and all of the other New Age children, Tarot, Shamanism, synchronicity, power animals and objects, multi-dimensional awareness, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th dimensions, the collective unconscious and collective conscious, spirit art, spirit guides, sacred space, empaths, medical intuition, past lives and I am sure much much more.<\/p> <p>We decide as a group what we want to study and share. This is an open group, anyone can attend. The purpose is for spiritual, emotional and soul growth. This group is also a support group of sorts, as we grow more aware it can sometimes be a little scary. So, we are there for each other--we all have our own unique experiences to share and teach. At times we can bring in teaching guests to learn from.<\/p> <p>The group is not only a forum and place where we can discuss and learn about metaphysics, but is also a place where each group member can share their experiences of this much shifting world where more and more people are feeling some sort of spiritual shift happening all around!<\/p> <p>The first meeting will be a get together to decide what we want to study, and to get to know everyone. Every group meetup will begin with a meditation after introductions. Every group meeting will have a well wishing time at the end, as everyone share a message from their intuitive mind.<\/p> <p>Most people wanted to meet on a weekend, so I chose the third Saturday of every month.<\/p> <p>I was thinking about meeting at the Panera Bread Company on Center avenue in Oakland, they have a private meeting room I can set up for our group.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group\/events\/229704810\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Metaphysical Meetup Group","id":"fspfslyvgbvb","time":1460844000000,"updated":1460857509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1231047204000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Metaphysics Meetup Group","group_lon":-79.8899993896,"id":1349042,"urlname":"The-Pittsburgh-Metaphysics-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.4300003052,"who":"People Interested in Metaphysics"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Houston","address_1":"10 N.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio. Players are expected to conduct themselves with good sportsmanship.<\/p> <p><b>What's included in the price?<\/b> Your payment helps to cover the rental costs, the hourly pay for your event host, and ensures a well-organized event.<\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Post your question in the comments section of this meetup and the event host or one of our organizers will reply.

She eagerly jets off to France while Chase stays home, working with her father, a former senator, on his upcoming mayoral campaign.<\/p> <p>Everything feels unbelievably perfect...until it doesn't. The hotel loses her reservation hours before her big interview.

Serena is grateful for her mysterious roommate's generosity, but it seems that there's more to her story than meets the eye.

This is also 3 weeks before the Wildflower meet up. I feel 3 weeks apart is sufficient. We should be anxious to get out of the house.<\/p> <p>\u00a0Please read the entire post. This is a self-guided driving tour. We will meet in Volant at 10 am and decide if anyone wants to go together in the cars.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Located one hour north of Pittsburgh, the Old Order Amish community of approximately 1,500 people lives in farms that surround the quaint villages of New Wilmington and Volant in the northern section of the county. Fourteen different districts comprise the community. The average church district is comprised of 75 adult members in addition to all of the unbaptized children and young adults. Church officials including a bishop govern each district. Decisions of the officials determine the way of life of the community.<\/p> <p>Descendants of Jakob Amman, the Amish have retained much of the same style clothing worn in the Palatine region of Switzerland during the sixteenth century. The plain, but functional garb sets them apart from the worldliness that threatens their existence. The similarity of dress also discourages pride and encourages modesty.<\/p> <p>Amish girls and women wear dresses primarily in colors of royal blue, navy blue, black or brown. Reds, pinks, oranges and yellows are prohibited, as are patterned fabrics. One thing is absolute. There are never buttons on the clothing of the Old Order Amish women.<\/p> <p>Men and boys wear denim trousers with two large overlapping panels in the front, which button to the waist. The bishop determines the number and size of buttons. Coats and vests are fastened by hook and eyes, never buttons. Suspenders are used to hold up the trousers. Belts are never worn.<\/p> <p>The Amish practice homechurching\u2013gathering for Sunday services at various homes. It is a major undertaking to host the preaching service. With the help of family and friends, the house is cleaned and scrubbed from top to bottom. The host family also provides the noon meal for the congregation.<\/p> <p>Many of the Amish in Lawrence County are agricultural or dairy farmers; the farms are usually passed from one generation to another. Horses are used to plow the fields. Some Amish subsidize their farm income with woodworking and construction.<\/p> <p>Tourists to Lawrence County may travel the back roads on the Amish community and view their way of life. The Amish do not like their faces to be photographed. For a taste of the simpler lifestyle, visit our beautiful Amish Countryside near Volant and New Wilmington. A self-guided tour offers a glimpse into a world devoid of modern chaos. These simple people have retained the lifestyle of their 16th-century ancestors. Their sprawling family farms are testaments to the values they pass on through generations. And please share the road with their buggies!<\/p> <p>A brochure providing the tour is available by calling the Lawrence County Tourist Promotion Agency, New Castle, Pennsylvania at[masked]-7599. \u00a0 Please call that number and get your tour map sent to you.

Inexperienced? In between? Need a little coaching to get through your turn? Ready to give it a shot? Come out and see us! If there is a specific game that you want to try, make a comment below ahead of time, and if someone we know has a copy, we will try to make it happen!<\/p> <p>Drop in any time after Noon. People come and go all day. RSVPs are very appreciated, and allow me to know to not cancel the event. But do drop in last minute if that's how life is working out for you. There is no admission to attend. If one person says they are certainly in, that's all I need to make the day worthwhile to keep on the schedule in my book. Hate to sit there with two bags of games like a dope.<\/p> <p>There is a rather good selection on food as well. For those who would enjoy beers and especially craft beers, they do have such things on site. Also a Starbucks, but that's not my game. We'll be playing in the dining area. Note that the dining area and food preparation services both shut down at 10 PM.

As a mother trying to support two young children after her husband\u2019s cruel betrayal, Frances jumps at the chance to meet the illustrious Mr. Poe at a small literary gathering, if only to help her fledgling career. Although not a great fan of Poe\u2019s writing, she is nonetheless overwhelmed by his magnetic presence\u2014and the surprising revelation that he admires <i>her<\/i> work.<\/p> <p>What follows is a flirtation, then a seduction, then an illicit affair\u2026and with each clandestine encounter, Frances finds herself falling slowly and inexorably under the spell of her mysterious, complicated lover.

Saturday night is loud with lots of children\u2019s and adult art activities, bands and the largest crowds. Sunday morning is more peaceful with much smaller crowds. The middle of the night has a whole other vibe to it with lots of local color. Interactive art activities occur throughout the whole event. And then the auction takes place Sunday at noon at the stage area. This is where all the art created by the onsite artists will be sold.<\/p> <p>What about children?<\/p> <p>Bring them with you! The show is open to everyone. Children\u2019s activities are held from 4 to 8 pm on Saturday and again at 10 am to 2 pm on Sunday next to a youth-friendly section of art.

Radio stations were destroyed and instruments burned. Overnight, musicians were forced into hiding or exile where most remain, even now. But rather than lay down their instruments, the musicians fought back, standing up for their cultural heritage and identity. This powerful film tells the story of the separatist\u2019s uprising, reveals rare footage of the jihadists, and follows several musicians as they perform at the first public concert in Timbuktu since the music ban.<\/p> <p>Johanna Schwartz | UK | 2015 | 105 min<\/p> <p>Note: One of the bands featured in this film, Songhoy Blues, performs at The Warhol on April 12: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.warhol.org\/responsive\/event.aspx?id=27110\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.warhol.org\/responsive\/event.aspx?id=27110<\/a><\/p> <p>Trailer:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/153930504\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/153930504<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-arthouse-films\/events\/230147926\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"They Will Have to Kill Us First @ The Harris","id":"230147926","time":1461453300000,"updated":1461465946000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1191950721000,"name":"Pittsburgh Arthouse Films","group_lon":-79.9599990845,"id":741891,"urlname":"pittsburgh-arthouse-films","group_lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Film Buffs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15120","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Homestead","address_1":"180 E Waterfront Drive ","lon":-79.914783,"phone":"(412) 462-1500","name":"Dave and Busters","id":842915,"state":"PA","lat":40.410604,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.51156616211,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458525745000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>It's been awhile since we went to Dave and Buster's.

Instruction by volunteers available on site. Compass loaners available on site.<\/p> <p>April 24, Carp I shelter, show up anytime between 10:45 and 2 PM. Event closes at 3:30 PM.<\/p> <p>Once at the park entrance, look for red-and-white arrow signs. Deer Lakes Workshop<br\/>24 April 2016<br\/>Preview<\/p> <p>ALL PARTICIPANTS must wear appropriate clothing (shoes that cover the feet and long pants). There may be ticks or other biting insects. Using insect repellant is an exceptionally good idea. It is Spring, so it is likely to be somewhat wet or muddy. Beginner Instruction:<\/p> <p>There will be two identical sessions, one starting at 11 am, the other starting at 1 pm. In each session, there will be instruction on map reading, simple use of the compass (orienting the map) and how an orienteering course works. If time allows, there may be additional instruction topics. There will also be an exercise in which participants can put what they have learned into practice. Each session will last approximately 90 minutes. Compasses will be loaned to those who do not have them. Intermediate Instruction:<\/p> <p>There will be a single session that starts at 12 noon and will last 1 \u00bd to 2 hours. The focus will be on off-trail navigation (following a bearing) and keeping track of distance, combined with terrain association. Various navigational and map handling tips will be introduced. Instruction will be done through a series of exercises that go around a short orienteering course, much of it off trail. Compasses will be loaned to those who do not have them. Advanced Exercises:<\/p> <p>There will be three types of exercises to choose from. Each involves doing a short orienteering course in one way or another. The courses are kept short to allow participants to do more than one exercise: starting on an exercise may be done between 11 am and 2:30 pm. Donut-Hole-O<\/p> <p>Activity: Given a map that has been erased for some distance surrounding a control location, make your way around a short cross-country orienteering course. Only the control circle appears in the erased area. There are no control descriptions but control flags are placed on standard orienteering features at the center of the control circles. Control flag numbers are shown, in sequence, on the map. Beware, there are controls from other courses nearby.<\/p> <p>Purpose: To practice choosing attack points, then practice using precise navigation from the attack point to the control location. Pathless-O Activity: Find the controls in a normal cross-country orienteering course using a map on which trails and possibly other black features have been removed. If you are thinking of doing more than one exercise, do this one first - the other exercises will show the trails, roads, etc. which would partly defeat the purpose of this exercise.<\/p> <p>Purpose: To practice using contours and vegetation features in terrain association; also to practice using the compass and making distance measurements. Corridor-O Activity: Follow the serpentine corridor counterclockwise from the start and find the controls which are placed on standard orienteering features at or near the center of the corridor. Some controls from other courses are also in the middle of the corridor. The corridor is about 75 m in width; only the map inside the corridor is shown. The control descriptions list only the control flag numbers in sequence order. Purpose: To practice precise terrain association and navigation.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-free\/events\/229412253\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":17100000,"name":"map and compass orienteering at Deer Lakes park","id":"229412253","time":1461509100000,"updated":1461527533000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1293768954000,"name":"Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh","group_lon":-79.9899978638,"id":1756412,"urlname":"pittsburgh-free","group_lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Pgh Cheapskates!"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15217","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"101 Panther Hollow Road","name":"Schenley Park Cafe","lon":-79.946861,"id":8383092,"state":"PA","lat":40.438229,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.20580911636,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458237356000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>From Goodreads:<\/p> <p>\"Sick of deeply personal accounts written in the first person?

By learning just a little bit of category theory, we can make our definition of simplicity much more precise. We can apply this definition in many ways, but one of the most powerful is to connect it to lambda calculus.

Most players wear volleyball-specific shoes, but gym shoes are also allowed. Please bring your shoes and change into them at the facility. This will help keep the floor clean of dirt and water.<\/p> <p><b>What to Expect: <\/b>Show up early! The games will begin at the time posted for this event. Players can start checking in with the event host as early as 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. If a court is available, you may begin warming up before the event begins. We limit play to 42 players per evening, which is 3 teams of 7 players per court. If we have 3 teams on a court, winners stay once and then shuffle out so everyone gets to play. If less people are in attendance, we divide based on who is there and mix things up half way through the session.<\/p> <p><b>Level of Play: <\/b>This event is open to all levels of play. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. Our ideal scenario is having one court of higher skilled players and one court of more recreational players. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.<\/p> <p><b>Facility Information:<\/b> Monroeville Sports Center is located at 855 Macbeth Drive in Monroeville. Parking should be ample in the free lot.<\/p> <p><b>Minimum number of players and playing formats.<\/b> This event needs a minimum of 12 people (not including the host) signed up before the start of the event in order to run. An email notification will be sent if we cancel. Refunds or credits will be issued if we cancel the event. Sign up early to encourage more people to sign up!!<\/p> <p><b>Do Your Part!<\/b> Help us keep an accurate guest count!\u00a0If you RSVP, we're counting on you to be there. If you change your mind about playing or your guest count changes, please update your RSVP. No-Shows will be marked on your account. If space is tight, we hold RSVP spots 10 minutes into advertised start and then open spots to walk-ups.<\/p> <p><b>Requirements to play:<\/b> This is an adult volleyball group. You must be 19 older. Males and females of all skill levels are welcome to play. There is no required gender ratio.

They've been divorced for four years, she's engaged to a new, terrific guy, and she's ready to leave the small town where she and Mason had so much history. She is so over Mason that she has absolutely no problem attending his wedding to the beautiful, intelligent, delightful Celia. But when fate intervenes and the wedding is called to a halt as the bride is literally walking down the aisle, Annajane begins to realize that maybe she's been given a second chance. Maybe everything happens for a reason. And maybe, just maybe, she wants Mason back. But there are secrets afoot in this small southern town. On the peaceful surface of Hideaway Lake, Annajane discovers that the past is never really gone. Even if there are people determined to keep Annajane from getting what she wants, happiness might be hers for the taking, and the life she once had with Mason in this sleepy lake town might be in her future.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/b\/7\/b\/600_447199323.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I will reserve a table","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club\/events\/229098974\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"RESCHEDULED -APRIL Robinson Bookclub - SPRING FEVER - Mary Kay Andrews","id":"229098974","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461809752000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1179772522000,"name":"The Pittsburgh Chick Lit Book Club","group_lon":-80.0699996948,"id":507383,"urlname":"Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club","group_lat":40.5,"who":"Book Readers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15108","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Moon Township","address_1":"8402 University Blvd.","name":"Doubletree Hotel","lon":-80.224573,"id":1383936,"state":"PA","lat":40.509119,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.7093133926,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461280017000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This month our guest speakers will be from the\u00a0Pennsylvania Coalition for Informed Consent and their presentation will be on \"Medical Freedom = Informed Consent.\"<\/p> <p>They\u00a0will discuss the importance of the medical standard of Informed Consent for all medical procedures and pharmaceutical products (including vaccines) and the\u00a0problems caused when the government mandates certain procedures.<\/p> <p><br\/>We will also be recapping Pennsylvania's primary results from the election the day before (to the extent that they are known), and we'll have our usual federal, state, and local updates.<\/p> <p>Sounds like an interesting meeting! \u00a0We hope to see you all there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Veterans-and-Patriots-United\/events\/230554748\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"VPU's Monthly Meeting for April 2016 (Medical Freedom)","id":"230554748","time":1461798000000,"updated":1461844707000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1236271006000,"name":"Veterans and Patriots United","group_lon":-80.1800003052,"id":1400108,"urlname":"Veterans-and-Patriots-United","group_lat":40.5099983215,"who":"Patriots"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"15216","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Pittsburgh","address_1":"3105 Banksville Road","name":"Coach's Bottleshop & Grille","lon":-80.044571,"id":12816712,"state":"PA","lat":40.399273,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":6.98698663712,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1461178202000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's go back to Coach's for the next knit night!\u00a0The food is good and the drinks are better!\u00a0 :)<\/p> <p>Pack up your project and come on out to Coach's Bottleshop and Grille for a fun night of crafts and conversation!

Beginning with the historical context of the reception of the Book of the Law, Crowley\u2019s critical experiences in NYC circa 1918, and his association with the extraordinary and somewhat enigmatic Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs, we examine these weighty assertions. The main body of the lecture includes an introduction to Yezidi culture and an overview of key Yezidi beliefs. These Yezidi traditions are discussed in the context of other ancient Middle Eastern religions. Interesting parallels to Thelema including (but not limited to) ritual practices, cosmology, magical formulae, and sinister forces are identified.<\/p> <p>Dr. Ron Lelito is a New York State licensed psychologist specializing in behavioral health, pain management, medical consultation, psychological assessment, and opioid dependence.

Their sound, highly influenced by Gamma Ray (who has traded members with this band) and Judas Priest, was introduced on their 1998 eponymous debut. The following year showed them gathering a press following when Jaws of Death gained them positive reviews from most respectable metal critics. On top of that, their European popularity flourished as power metal enjoyed moderate success in the overseas mainstream. Nuclear Fire followed in 2001, leading to their first U.S. appearances in the guise of several large metal festivals throughout the year. They returned to the studio in early 2002, recording and releasing Black Sun by the end of spring. ~ Bradley Torreano, All Music Guide<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Luca Turilli's Rhapsody:<\/b><\/p> <p>Luca Turilli is the Italian guitar player and composer who in 1993, together with the keyboard player Alex Staropoli, founded the symphonic metal band Rhapsody. The band released their first album, Legendary Tales, in 1997 and quickly followed with their sophomore release, Symphony Of Enchanted Lands one year later, both reaching high chart positions and establishing what became called \"Hollywood Metal\" at first and then some years later becoming known as \"Film Score metal.\" Both genres were clearly describing a new style of music based on the connection between the most epic and glorious power\/speed metal of the late '80s with Luca and Alex's infinite passion for the cinema and the world of soundtracks. This genre - enriched by folk music influences, guitar playing of neoclassical inspiration and lyrics related with the fantasy \"sagas\" created by Luca Turilli himself, influenced a whole generation of new bands in the years to follow and Rhapsody became one of the most important acts of the last decade in the world of heavy\/rock music. In 2003, the band was forced to change their name to Rhapsody Of Fire because of legal reasons due to copyright problems. That same year, they started an exclusive collaboration with Sir Christopher Lee, the most filmed actor in the history of cinema. His presence as special guest and narrator for the \"Dark Secret\" saga added great pathos to the heroic tale told over 5 albums.<\/p> <p>After 15 years, 10 official albums, and more than 1,500,000 copies sold worldwide, the cycle related with the fantasy sagas (the epic tale on which all the music &amp; lyrics of the band were based) came to an end. In that same moment, Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli decided to proceed with a friendly split and continue their artistic careers separately while both keeping the name Rhapsody - mainly to be able to go on with the same artistic possibilities in the name of all the personal economical investment made by both parties to bring the band to the top through many years of hard &amp; passionate work. The split was communicated officially to the press on August 2011.<\/p> <p>Alex Staropoli agreed to continue as Rhapsody Of Fire while Luca Turilli moved on as Rhapsody, adding his name on top of the logo due to the same legal reasons of the past not allowing to him to use the word Rhapsody alone. While the original singer Fabio Lione remained with Alex, Luca was followed by the two band members &amp; personal friends Dominique Leurquin (Guitar) and Patrice Guers (Bass). Alex Holzwarth (Drums) deciding to keep his place in both bands.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, totally not confusing at all.

Trails lead through a variety of habitats like oak-hickory forest, pine plantations, woodland meadows, and flood plain forest along Raccoon Creek. Wildflowers can be observed throughout the growing season with peak wildflower blooms occuring in late April and August.

Producer Joe Roth (\"Maleficent,\" \"Alice in Wonderland\") once again leads the team in a breathtaking new tale nested in the legendary saga. Long before the evil Queen Ravenna (Theron) was thought vanquished by Snow White\u2019s blade, she watched silently as her sister, Freya (Blunt), suffered a heartbreaking betrayal and fled their kingdom. With Freya\u2019s ability to freeze any enemy, the young ice queen has spent decades in a remote wintry palace raising a legion of deadly huntsmen\u2014including Eric (Hemsworth) and warrior Sara (Chastain)\u2014only to find that her prized two defied her one demand: Forever harden your hearts to love. When Freya learns of her sister\u2019s demise, she summons her remaining soldiers to bring the Magic Mirror home to the only sorceress left who can harness its power. But once she discovers Ravenna can be resurrected from its golden depths, the wicked sisters threaten this enchanted land with twice the darkest force it\u2019s ever seen.
