Either that or you actually meet a person here and a person there and there's no chemistry so it's over. More wasted time. I've been hosting walking events on Meetup groups for over 3 years and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best way to meet a woman because you're not just meeting 1 woman. It's like going on a date with 10 to 50 women at once and you get to walk and talk to them all. The only problem with regular walking groups is that you don't know who's single and who' isn't.

I adore great films and even more, sharing my opinions, hearing other's opinions and having lively discussions about movies. I would love to gather together other movie buffs to see movies in a theater and then do brunch, lunch or dinners where we talk about the film and just have fun. Everyone is welcome, the only thing you need is a love of movies, an opinion to share and a sense of humor! This meet up will take suggestions and opinions for movies and places to eat. I would say if you live in North NJ in Bergen, Essex or Hudson County that would be convenient. See you at the movies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: I appreciate yearly dues of $5.00 which are given to me at first meetup.<\/p>\n<p>If you RSVP and do not show up and do not notify us, you will be removed.

If you want to get involved in video production, and are an adult of sound mind and body this may be for you. We meet to voluntarily exchange media and production work. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The rules:<\/p>\n<p>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos. <br> <\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded.&nbsp; Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. <br> <\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity.

More than just a drinking and dining-out group, this group is about learning and experiencing all that we consume--as it relates to culture, heritage, history and so much more!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>A few things to note:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>1) Events: All events will be designed to foster friendship.&nbsp; Dinners will not have large attendance lists, whereas happy hours will not be capped.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>2) Age: This group is intended for people in their 30's.&nbsp; I'd appreciate it if you respect that.&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>3) <\/span>In an effort to stem the amount of people who RSVP and fail to show up, I\u2019m going to implement the following policy for any person who RSVPs for the 1st time to an event that has a set reservation number and has not shown up to any past events:<\/p>\n<p>When you RSVP as a 1st Timer, I will send you a message to confirm that you will be attending the event. To confirm, simply respond to my message within 48 hours, and you\u2019ll remain on the RSVP list. In the event I do not hear back from you within those 48 hours, if there\u2019s a wait-list, I will remove you from the RSVP list to have someone from the wait-list take your spot.<\/p>\n<p>So please be sure you have your meetup settings allowing me as organizer to send you messages through meetup directly. <\/p>\n<p><span>4) Removal: If you\u2019re been a member of the group for six months and haven\u2019t RSVP\u2019d or attended a single event, then I reserve the right to remove you from the group. I know that there are a ton of meetup options for one to partake in this great city, but I hope that if you signed up for this group, you\u2019re genuinely interested in giving it a shot \u2013 stop by for a drink at one the the next happy hours, or take a chance and try a new cuisine while meeting some new folks.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also, if you've RSVP'd to at least 2 meetups, and fail to show up without changing your RSVP and\/or notifying me of your absence, I reserve the right to remove you from the group.

We understand that things come up and life interferes, but please do your best. ;)<br>\n\n<br>\n\n*If you find that you can't make it to something you've signed up for -- CHANGE YOUR RSVP as soon as possible, or call\/text\/message an organizer\/event host if it is within 2 hours of the event.

Our purpose is simple: to be a place where single Jewish gay men can meet in fun, no-pressure, no non-sense environments so that they can find that special Jewish someone. For too long, too many Jewish gay men ended up dating non-Jewish men because (a) there aren't that many of out there to begin with; \u00a0and (b) with gay couples, starting a family and having a \"Jewish home,\" was not as much a priority as for a heterosexual couple. But now that's changing. More gay couples are starting families. We strive to be an alternative to those events around the City where supposedly one can meet gay Jewish men, but which can be a bit clique-ish (and also very expensive).

That means simply participating or signing up to lead us in a presentation.\u00a0<span>Is there anything you've always wanted to try but never did or a way you've wanted to push yourself, or something you love deeply that you wish you did more?

If you RSVP and cannot go, please provide notice a day in advance. Of course, we understand there are emergencies, but please do let us know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) RSVP policy: If you RSVP and cancel the day before the meetup, please send the organizer(s) a message to notify them. If you RSVP and do not show up on occasion depending on the circumstances you may be either suspended from the group for a longer period of time, or removed from the group. Though this may sound harsh, please understand that the organizers put time and effort into planning these meetups. More importantly, this gives others a chance to attend our events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) Profile pictures: Please have a clear photo of yourself when you join.

Campos<\/p>\n<p>Kizomba (a word meaning \"Party\" in angola ) takes its origin from the Angolan dance Semba, which is also the origin of the Brazilian Samba.<\/p>\n<p>It appeared at the end of 70\u2019s \u2013 80\u2019s, while the young Angolans, although very attached to their traditional dance,sought a new musical identity, and finally found their inspiration and new voice at a concert given by Kassav, a famous French Caribbean Zouk band. Kizomba was born out of this new generation\u2019s desire to bring a touch of sensuality and sweetness to their national Semba.<\/p>\n<p>The influence of the Angolan Kizomba soon spread to all the African Lusophone countries such as Guinea Bisau, Cape Verde, Mozambique. From there the dance quickly found its ticket to Europe via Portugal, where it further developed, by all these Artists, teachers, choregraphers coming from <br> these Luso-African countries.<\/p>\n<p>As it rapidly gained popularity, Portugal exported Kizomba to various countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Danemark and England. Today it is rare to find a Latin dance party without Kizomba represented, as well as salsa or bachata.<\/p>\n<p>This \"African Tango Zouk\", also called \"Tango Lusophone\" continues to conquer a growing audience of passionate dancers, eager for beauty of gesture and sensuality, but also the indispensable complexity of exchange and trust present in each motions of Kizomba.<\/p>\n<p>This young dance of barely thirty years is booming today, and constantly evolving.<\/p>\n<p>\"Kizomba is a tribute to sensuality, an ode to love and sharing.

A Course in Miracles is a complete self-study spiritual thought system based on universal spiritual themes.

For the purpose of shared reading, we recommend that members bring the book titled, A Course in Miracles, Published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, Combined Volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way: Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0All are welcome to join us in this gentle and relaxed setting of learners.$5 donation for room.

After starting a job in management consulting, I found it difficult to consistently attend any existing running group sessions, as most did not accommodate my unique working hours. I tend to hit the pavement by 6am for morning runs, an after 8pm for post-work runs. I also live and work in the financial district, and have found few groups who meet in my neighborhood. This group will meet rather early or late, depending on the day, for group runs at moderate (weekend warrior) pace runs. We will run primarily out-and-back and loop runs that start and end in the financial district, and can be more creative on weekend runs.

The Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp is an event where we encourage a community of entrepreneurs, investors and professional service providers, among others, in New York City to learn, think about and have dialogue on technology\u2019s future impact on society. How will driverless cars affect the insurance industry? Is space exploration a needed component to our nations future? Is there such thing as privacy?<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach an understanding, the Lower Manhattan Tech MeetUp invites our country\u2019s foremost experts to tackle these topics. But we also need YOU, to bring your background and point of view. This MeetUp is not meant to answer all the questions and solidify the solutions, rather its purpose is to foster the conversations and facilitate discussions around the topics.<\/p>\n<p>If you're an entrepreneur, tech professional, or anyone genuinely interested how technology will affect society, this MeetUp is an opportunity to listen and learn, exchange ideas and network with liked-minded individuals.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.

Resources for larger women are slim to none (pun intended!). Therefore, I want to create a network of plus sized women that are a RESOURCE FOR EACH OTHER. I want to build strong friendships, have fun with people who feel comfortable around each other, and provide an ample shoulder to lean on when times get tough. THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BBW ADMIRERS!! This group is for plus sized women who want to do the following with each other: - shopping... at stores where clothes fit us! - fun outings... where the activity level fits our needs and abilities! - movies... with people who understand that we need a seat in between each other, and don't feel weird about it! - dinner out... without anyone looking at your plate and wondering if you should \"really be eating that!\" - fitness...without judgement, at a pace and level that works for each person! - FEEL FREE TO BE 100% WHO WE ARE AROUND EACH OTHER! I live in Maplewood but work in Piscataway, so meet ups will be in central &amp;amp; Northern NJ, as well as NYC, which I LOVE!

Non-denominational and undogmatic, the worldwide Oneness Blessing phenomenon attracts  participants of all ages from all walks of life and beliefs (or non-beliefs) who bond over  a common desire for something more in life. \n\nThe blessing is a brief, light laying on of hands of subtle energies transmitted by Oneness Blessing Givers that initiate a neurophysical change in the brain, declutching the mind and quieting inner chatter and divisiveness. Participants experience deep inner peace and expansiveness during the process, resulting in growing clarity, inner peace, self-acceptance, personal breakthroughs, and miracles. \n\nThe evening includes a chakra meditation to raise kundalini (energy) and a discussion or Q&A period.

I'm looking for members who are hungry to be successful in the entertainment industry. All actors and crew members, whether motivated newbies or experienced talent, are welcomed to join. <br><\/p>\n<p>My experience, with several film meetup groups, is that everyone is overly-ambitious at the inception. Many times, the group attempts to complete only one project (successfully or unsuccessfully), then everyone disappears into oblivion. Many actors stray away to other projects, hoping it could be their big break. Projects crumble. There is no business savvy to take a completed project to the next level. Etc Etc. Hopefully, this group will be different from the norm. <br><\/p>\n<p>My intention is to propel this group towards the online media platform. I personally don't want this group to be working for free all the time, grovelling for attention at mediocre film festivals, begging for money on Kickstarter or IndieGogo or be a total waste of time, effort and labor. Creating content online is the only smart way for independent filmmakers to fully explore their creativity, maintain ownership, become recognized for their hard work and generate revenue for their projects, without experiencing the hassles of the industry. The big guys come to you after. I know this because I've seen this happen thousands of times with online talent. Simply because, these guys are perfecting their own talent and individual brand, and not grovelling to please anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I'm a highly efficient, determined and organized individual. Within 7 months, I've already worked on a national Dunkin Donuts commercial, worked with the brilliant veteran actress Judith Roberts, became a verified YouTube Partner and have 10 episodes in Post Production of my first web series, whilst juggling my day job and social life. If you think the same and don't make excuses, not only will we get along great, but we will be closer to \"REEL\" success! <br><\/p>\n<p>In this group, you will have an opportunity to collaborate with each other. I, also, have several projects in the pipeline, so there will always be something to work on. Everyone will be properly credited on IMDB as well. <br><\/p>\n<p>Here are a list of issues that will get you banned from the group: <br><\/p>\n<p>-If there is any form of member harassment, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you flake without reason, you will be banned.<\/p>\n<p>-If you never contribute to the group, you will be banned. I'm very meticulous about people lurking around with the possible intention of taking our ideas. Even if you can't attend production meetings or the actual shoot, contributions can range from feedback, constructive criticism, editing, scoring, designing posters etc.<\/p>\n<p>-If you don't answer the intro questions, you will be denied entry into the group.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyways, that's enough of me blabbering for now.<span> Thanks, and welcome to the group! <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>-Nash.<\/p>\n<p>(Director, Writer, Motion Graphics Designer) <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/highres_442034195.jpeg","photo_id":442034195,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/600_442034195.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/7\/7\/3\/thumb_442034195.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":78914272,"name":"Nash","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/highres_243811229.jpeg","photo_id":243811229,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/member_243811229.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/9\/f\/d\/thumb_243811229.jpeg"}},"members":167,"name":"REEL Shooters","id":18422815,"state":"NY","urlname":"ReelShooters","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Reel Shooters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423514461000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"lunch","name":"Lunch","id":19892},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"meet-for-lunches","name":"Meet for Lunches","id":28189},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"personal-achievement","name":"Personal Achievement","id":122618},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Breakfast-Focused-Networking-Happy-Hours-NYC\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Hi all!

BubbleBall guarantees to make you spin, bounce and laugh like no other sport in history!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>What is Bubble Ball Soccer?<\/p>\n<p>Bubble soccer (also known as \u201cBoblefotball\u201d \"bubble football\" \"bumperz\" and \"bubble ball\") is the brainchild of Henrik Elvestad and Johan Goldenfirst. The first game appeared on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIl45f6i1PU\"><i>Golden Goal<\/i><\/a>, a Norwegian TV show, in 2011. Since then it has rapidly spread like wildfire throughout the world and finally, Bubble Ball Soccer has landed in NYC (the tri-state area).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To play, teams of up to ten players don typical soccer\/sports clothing and put their giant bubble ball suits (loosely described as giant, inflatable hamster balls) on top. Each suit is very safe and is designed for any type of weather or outdoor arena.They have a built in backpack style harness so you can strap the balls on, and handles to allow for pain free spills, hard tackling, bumping, knocking, bouncing and rolling.<\/p>\n<p>Don't worry though, you won't get a yellow card for this type of behavior. Bubble ball soccer is a full contact sport and there are no tackling fouls to be heard of. Roughhousing is actually encouraged and&nbsp;what makes bubble ball soccer so much fun! The balls will absorb the tackle and do what it does best, bounce back and bring you to&nbsp;your feet without causing you any harm, pain or injury!<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the actual rules? Simple - keep the balls in bounds and score! This is a lot harder than it looks (actually it doesn't look easy at all) and as a result most games end up with only a few goals. Despite this fact, it's still a very entertaining game to watch and even more fun to play. Expect to&nbsp;burn up to 1000&nbsp;calories, sweat, laugh, get some aggression out and experience withdrawal symptoms until your next round!<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/highres_440702134.jpeg","photo_id":440702134,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/600_440702134.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/6\/thumb_440702134.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":273759,"name":"camille","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/highres_66728792.jpeg","photo_id":66728792,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/member_66728792.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/2\/5\/8\/thumb_66728792.jpeg"}},"members":241,"name":"NYC Bubble Ball","id":18427171,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Bubble-Ball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bubble Ballers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1423656423000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"publicspeaking","name":"Public Speaking","id":9300},{"urlkey":"leadership","name":"Leadership","id":15121},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"presentations","name":"Presentations","id":16223},{"urlkey":"personal-development","name":"Personal Development","id":16468},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"communication-skills","name":"Communication Skills","id":20923},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"fear-of-public-speaking","name":"Fear of Public Speaking","id":42862},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Speech-Party-Speed-Learn-Public-Speaking-for-Busy-People\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are on a mission to save the world from boring presentations.&nbsp;

I will provide great snacks (usually involves CHOCOLATE in one form or another) and drinks, and assist you with your creative projects.

Please read the description all the way down, thank you.<\/p>\n<p> I am a new business owner in the Central NJ area and this group is for my fellow new female business owners and\/or professionals that are transitioning into entrepreneurship. Mastermind groups offer a combination of brainstorming, education, peer accountability, and support in a group setting to sharpen your business and personal skills. The main purpose of this group is to hold each member accountable to her goals, provide access to information\/resources, and support. How may we serve you? <br><\/p>\n<p>This group is for success-minded ladies who take full responsibility for their lives and are focused on solutions. We are made up of a diverse array of women. We will be small so we can develop a real community and connection. <br><\/p>\n<p>*This group is not a company, we are not peddling services or products, and our meetings will not serve as a platform to advertise any companies or businesses*. <br><\/p>\n<p>How it will work - The Roundtable <br><\/p>\n<p>This group will meet at least once a week. Each lady will take a turn and speak about what she is working on, goals, and with what she needs help. Whenever a person is speaking, everybody else will be respectful and listen to her without judgment. Then for the next 20-30 minutes, the rest of us will brainstorm, share ideas, solutions, and constructive feedback towards a solution for her. Each lady will feel free to share as much or as little as she wants. This will not be a \"woe is me\" session and every lady will be safe to share herself without fear of being attacked or made to feel ridiculous. <br><\/p>\n<p>Kindness above all else is our most valued principle. <br><\/p>\n<p>After the meeting is over, we can leave, or just chat and get to know each other. Come prepared to laugh, form friendships, and have intelligent discussions with other incredible females.\ufeff<\/p>","lon":-74.4000015259,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/highres_434510516.jpeg","photo_id":434510516,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/600_434510516.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/5\/5\/4\/thumb_434510516.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":11814005,"name":"Udochi E.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/highres_9340826.jpeg","photo_id":9340826,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/member_9340826.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/f\/7\/a\/thumb_9340826.jpeg"}},"members":95,"name":"Millionaire Ladies' Mastermind Group","id":18450412,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Millionaire-Ladies-Mastermind-Group","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.5099983215,"who":"Incredible Ladies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Long Beach","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424529156000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"sportsfans","name":"Sports Fan","id":83},{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"ultimatefrisbee","name":"Ultimate Frisbee","id":2077},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"sports-and-socials","name":"Sports and Socials","id":17555},{"urlkey":"long-beach","name":"long beach","id":19288},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"freestyle-frisbee","name":"Freestyle Frisbee","id":84705},{"urlkey":"co-ed-ultimate-frisbee","name":"Co-ed Ultimate Frisbee","id":88542},{"urlkey":"recreational-sports","name":"Recreational Sports","id":131178},{"urlkey":"frisbee-other-pick-up-sports","name":"Frisbee & Other Pick-up Sports","id":1455832}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Frisbee-Toss-Long-Beach\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you love the sun, sand and surf?

Look at the soles of your shoes, for most people the left and right soles are worn out unequally. Measure the size of your calves. For most people, the shape and size may not be the same because they do not use both sides of their body equally. This is why, what should naturally happen when we take each step cannot happen properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Natural Healing Abilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Our body is specially designed and created. A grazed skin or a broken bone can naturally mend itself. Our body is equipped with countless natural healing abilities.

We started out as a one Sunday a month Bible study and as more interest grew we became a local body of believers with church services every Sunday and some services in the week. In June of 2014 we moved a pastor into the Bronx.

Today of those six, two are missionaries in Honduras, two of us are involved in the church plant here in the Bronx, and two are settled in Pennsylvania. My wife and I are known in the community here in South Bronx as the family with the 5 boys. That recently changed when boy number 6 joined the family.

In short, this groups' focus is getting full on food and fun, but can and will expand to any activity that increases our participation in living a positively happy and healthy life.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/c\/highres_436143292.jpeg","photo_id":436143292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/c\/600_436143292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/c\/thumb_436143292.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":21927141,"name":"Monique","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/highres_244177862.jpeg","photo_id":244177862,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/member_244177862.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/3\/e\/6\/thumb_244177862.jpeg"}},"members":109,"name":"HIV+ NY Professional Singles Fanatic 4 Food & Fun","id":18467841,"state":"NY","urlname":"HIV-NY-Professional-Singles-Fanatic-for-Food-Fun","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.8400001526,"who":"Positively Happy Foodies"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Westfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425173885000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"singles","name":"Singles","id":498},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"women-over-40","name":"Women over 40","id":15454},{"urlkey":"nightlife-girls-night-out-friends","name":"NightLife,Girl's Night Out, Friends","id":18232},{"urlkey":"eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc","name":"Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc","id":19130},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"coffee-books","name":"Coffee & Books","id":41901}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Womens-Book-Club\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This is a book club designed for local women 40+ who love to read and discuss great books over some food and wine or coffee and tea! &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We started meeting in April 2015 and the format has evolved. &nbsp; The last few meetings have been held in a &nbsp;cozy room in the back of 16 Prospect, a restaurant in Westfield, and this seems to have worked out nicely. &nbsp;We have been meeting on a Wednesday night once a month and have mostly been enjoying current fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to make book suggestions!&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-74.3499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10105891,"name":"Kathy ","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/d\/3\/highres_244605267.jpeg","photo_id":244605267,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/d\/3\/member_244605267.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/0\/d\/3\/thumb_244605267.jpeg"}},"members":310,"name":"Westfield Area Women's Book Club","id":18468256,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Westfield-Womens-Book-Club","category":{"name":"book clubs","id":18,"shortname":"book-clubs"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Fellow Readers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425174387000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"java","name":"Java","id":189},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","id":3833},{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"critical-thinking","name":"Critical Thinking","id":15544},{"urlkey":"mobile-technology","name":"Mobile Technology","id":16216},{"urlkey":"android-developers","name":"Android Development","id":20346},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"objective-c","name":"Objective C","id":21477},{"urlkey":"computer-programming","name":"Computer programming","id":48471},{"urlkey":"ios","name":"iOS","id":106382},{"urlkey":"ios-development","name":"iOS Development","id":127567},{"urlkey":"women-software-developers","name":"Women Software Developers","id":149654}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/methodologies\/","rating":5,"description":"<p><i><b>\"Learning to program in an unstructured structured environment...\"<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>Online learning has taken profound leaps forward with institutions from Amazon to Stanford University offering FREE online courses.

It was one of the steps to a total and significant overhaul of my life. I decided to take greater responsibility for my body, soul, and mind. I was very conflicted in my heart; I liked my relaxed hair, but I realized that the chemicals in the relaxers were not good for the health issues I had. Since I did not know what direction to take, I spent one week praying and journaling my prayers, thoughts, and any answers that God had given me. After a week, the answer was obvious; I needed to change my hair care routine.&nbsp;There were three steps I took to turn things around.<\/p>\n<p>The first step of my natural hair journey was to educate myself on natural African textured hair. I had a relaxer for 25 years of my then 36 years of life, so I had no idea how to even take care of my REAL TEXTURED hair. I followed natural hair blogs, watched natural hair YouTube videos, and read books and articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next step was to stop relaxing my hair. At first this was easy, but one year into it and I was rocking an Erykah Badu African wrap-up EVERYDAY!! My wash routine (which started the night before) would sometimes take over 3 hours and consisted of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, washing, moisturizing, sealing, and protective styling. This took a lot of time and gallons of water. I had to stop swimming, water aerobics and doing serious cardio in the gym because the so-called natural products would run down my face and burn my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Last step I took was to I made 14 satin pillow cases and sleep bonnets. You all know us beautiful colored girls HAVE to tie our hair up at night with satin scarves or hair bonnets, sleep on satin pillow cases and wear satin scarves in the winter to protect our edges and keep moisture in. Well, you also know that satin hair bonnets, don\u2019t always stay on our heads at night, so sometimes I\u2019d wake up with product on my face.<\/p>\n<p>HAIR PRODUCTS were the hardest thing ever. I spent lots of money and had various brands of so-called natural products. At first it would work and then it would stop, as if my hair was saying, \u201cYo, chick, I\u2019m over this! Next!\u201d I battled with lots of end knots, dryness, and split ends. My hair was growing but I could never leave it out because it would dry up so fast. I would have to saturate my hair over and over again with moisturizers. My biggest concern at that point was that it would eventually seep down my face and into my eyes. I hated that, so I did some more research on products I could use. Last year, I finally decided to go \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d for my hair. I was basically DIY for almost everything except my makeup (which is my 2015 goal)! I was a bit nervous, but with God\u2019s help, I found amazing recipes and ingredients to use.<\/p>\n<p>This opened up a new world of hair care products to me. I felt more in control and I felt confident. I controlled what I used in my hair because I made it. This was so exciting, and I made many different combinations of things. My motto was that I should be able to ingest anything I put on my skin and in my hair. My hair products consisted a combination of Young Living Essential Oils (Lavender, Rosemary, Lemon, Geranium, Cedar wood, Thyme, and Clary sage) with organic carrier oils (Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Grape-seed Oil, Jojoba oil, Olive oil and Shea Butter). In addition, I used Vegetable Glycerin and Aloe Vera gel for moisturizers and Dr Bronners\u2019 unscented soap to create my own shampoo solutions.&nbsp; These products worked wonders on my hair and skin, along with cutting down my wash routine drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can now go swimming, do water aerobics and hard cardio in the gym wihtout worrying about products dripping from my hair. Also, whenever my hair bonnet would come off at night I rest assured that the products in my hair are also good for my face too. HOLLA!!&nbsp; (Vegetable Glycerin is pretty sweet). It took several months of trial and error, but I am now able to confidently write and say that my hair has flourished under these products, and I myself have become healthier for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/highres_434919189.jpeg","photo_id":434919189,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/600_434919189.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/1\/5\/thumb_434919189.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","members":562,"name":"Kinky, Curly, Coiled, Natural Hair Meetup","id":18476380,"state":"NY","urlname":"naturallynatural","category":{"name":"fashion\/beauty","id":8,"shortname":"fashion-beauty"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"naturally natural"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425471409000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"singles-30s-50s","name":"Singles 30's-50's","id":16660},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"professional-singles","name":"Single Professionals","id":18216},{"urlkey":"dating-over-35","name":"Dating over 35","id":20662},{"urlkey":"new-york-city-events","name":"New York City Events","id":26546},{"urlkey":"singles-events","name":"Singles events","id":29852},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"singles-40s-50s","name":"Singles 40's - 50's","id":61916}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Single-And-Ready-To-Mingle-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all singles!!!

They have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David Stewart, Ph.D., D.N.M. Integrated Aromatic Science Practitioner, describes the function of these fragrant essential oils in his book, The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God\u2019s Love Manifest in Molecules.<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have been called \u201cthe life blood of a plant.\u201d They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p>When essential oils are applied to people, they do the same thing, carrying oxygen into cells and carrying waste products out. In fact, essential oils are one of nature\u2019s best body cleansers. They can cleanse our cellular receptor sites of pharmaceutical drugs, petrochemicals, and other disruptors of intercellular communication. They can also chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the liver, colon, sweat, lungs, and kidneys. They can also increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients. [Page 59]<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I use Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Essential oils have also been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties. Young Living has always been at the forefront of bringing this ancient tradition to modern users, introducing millions to a total mind body wellness they may never have dreamed possible. Primarily extracted through careful steam distillation but also through cold pressing, the purest essential oils are far more powerful than the botanicals from which they were extracted. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding nature's pure essence. Any time you hold a bottle of our powerful essential oils, you are holding the pure essence of health-promoting botanicals that can be diffused, inhaled, applied topically, incorporated into massage, or taken internally to:<\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Inspire a positive emotional state:<\/b> Each essential oil\u2019s complex, pleasant, and unique scent activates the limbic system\u2014the brain\u2019s center of emotion and memory\u2014differently. Essential oils can be your key to a more fulfilling and balanced emotional life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils are convenient<\/b>, quick and easy to use.You can wear them during the day, diffuse them in your home or work place, or simply keep them in your pocket. Essential oils can be used in massage, and to enhance meditation and concentration.<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils&nbsp; penetrate the skin and cell membranes<\/b>.They can actually diffuse throughout the blood and tissues instantly in a matter of seconds! Oils cross the brain-blood barrier and reach the amygdala and other limbic parts of the brain that control our mood, emotions and beliefs. So they can help us with our ability to handle stress, anger or any other emotion we are dealing with!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance your physical wellness :<\/b>Modern lifestyles don\u2019t always create optimal conditions for physical wellness. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and an overabundance of environmental toxins can leave the body unbalanced and diminish energy levels. From cleansing and weight management to supporting every system of the body, essential oils and essential oil-infused supplements can provide the targeted solutions you need to restore balance and feel your best.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include oxygenating properties<\/b>.Because they contain oxygen molecules they can transport nutrients to cells that are nutrient and\/or oxygen deprived. Healthy cells need oxygen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil benefits include that they are high in antioxidants.<\/b> We know that antioxidants strengthen the body\u2019s systems to prevent the damaging effects of aging, diet, and the environment; and eliminate free radicals. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) which tells you the antioxidant capacity of a food item is documented for many essential oils. Clove essential oil has an ORAC value of 1,078,700 \u00b5TE\/100g; this is a million more than the value for carrots which is 210 \u00b5TE\/100g!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Purify your home<\/b>: Harsh chemical formulas aren\u2019t your only home cleansing option. Enjoy peace of mind without compromise when you polish countertops, clean sticky messes, and cleanse dirty surfaces with the gentle but effective power of essential oils,<\/p>\n<p><b>Refine your skin:<\/b> Purge chemicals from your beauty routine and rediscover your natural glow. An ancient skin care secret, essential oils can help promote a clear-looking complexion, soften the appearance of signs of aging, and nurture healthy-looking hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oils soothe muscles and joints.<\/b> They also can assist with minor aches and pains related to everyday activities especially in combination with massage. Yeah! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Essential oil soothe digestion.<\/b> Peppermint (Mentha piperita)is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also restore digestive efficiency. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Essential oil benefits include d-limonene a powerful antioxidant Lemon consists of 68 percent dlimonene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Create deep spiritual awareness:<\/b> Incense and essential oils from plants have always played an important part in religious and spiritual ceremonies, helping participants to transcend the trivial and connect with something larger than themselves. Research shows that the pure constituents in these oils stimulate olfactory receptors and activate regions in the brain\u2019s limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and state of mind. To enhance your spiritual practice, dilute and apply meditative, empowering essential oils directly to wrists, feet, and behind the ears, or diffuse in a quiet space.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why I chose Young Living Essential Oils<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Young Living is proud to set the standard for essential oil purity and authenticity by carefully monitoring the production of our oils through our unique Seed to Seal\u00ae process.

So far we have averaged around 2 per week. <br><\/p>\n<p>2). I am aiming to organize smaller dinners so everyone can get to know each other and we avoid being a large and awkward group. Dinners will almost always be around 4-5 people. This makes it very important that you show up if you RSVP. So far I have been asking new members for a written confirmation of attendance and we have had 100% attendance. I hope this will continue. <br><\/p>\n<p>3). Fees: I hate it when meetups charge a few dollars from each member. It makes me feel like the organizer is making money instead of bringing people together to enjoy an activity. I will cover all the meetup fees for now. If anyone wants to contribute feel free to but for now I am not going to ask.<\/p>\n<p> 4). A lot of groups seem to do the same activities or go to the same places over and over again. I will find new and exciting places to try that have good write ups and reviews.

The current power structure will have you believe that all that exists is the physical world before your eyes. Yet, they use spiritual and other supernatural means to control and dominate the planet all the while conspiring to limit your potential as a divine being. They have subversively replaced our moral values given to us by our ancient ancestors with the worship of satanism, sex, money, materialism, militarism, power, racism, and sexism. They have further replaced true spiritualism with religious dogma and the belief in the five senses (physical existence) only. In fact, they are the chief architects of many of the planets conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Project Illuminated is a global effort to reveal the truth of our existence and show you how to create a new reality. One where you don't need to protest, amass a military like arsenal of weapons or get into wars to change the direction of the world. The powerful and free information as presented through this group will reveal the secrets of the universe that will help revolutionize our current thought process. It will in essence bring about a new found freedom and connection to every living thing on the planet.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectilluminated.com\">www.projectilluminated.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":14496082,"name":"Qesankh Maa Kheperu","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/6\/b\/highres_244364651.jpeg","photo_id":244364651,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/6\/b\/member_244364651.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/e\/6\/b\/thumb_244364651.jpeg"}},"members":178,"name":"Project Illuminated Meetup","id":18485091,"state":"NY","urlname":"Project-Illuminated-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Illuminated"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1425821511000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"value-investing","name":"Value Investing","id":18616}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Corner-of-Berkshire-and-Fairfax-NYC\/","rating":4.94,"description":"<p>This meetup is for value investing enthusiasts -- Graham and Buffett acolytes.

We use the workout to bring our peers to together to talk about the Lord and praise Him thru our bodies and the gift of fitness. We use the cool down as a time to rejoice and pray for others as we prepare for our God-given purpose.

Join Us - MeetOut NYC. In-addition to the meetup events we will hold, we will use the accompanying MeetOut app (meetoutapp.com), to give you the flexibility to further connect with the people in this group. This is a free app that the organizer (me) created to help foster greater engagement within our meetup groups. We are staying true to the Meetup mission and allow our members greater collaboration among themselves based on common interests and activities.

HIPS explores the current and future applications of the behavioral and social sciences to solve real-world problems through monthly meetups and online publications.

But the idea is for the couple to eventually join the meetups in person.\n\nThe THIRD purpose of this group is for other K-1 Filipino females in NYC to make new friends with each other (since most are away from their families\/culture\/friends for long periods of time and their husbands\/fiances are usually at work).  Filipino women in America need to stick together. \n\nThe FOURTH purpose of this group is for single American men who are looking to meet\/date Filipino women in Philippines for possible marriage and using the same K-1 visa fiance process to bring her over here.  Local singles interested can join this group for separate meetups nights.  If a K-1 visa filipina member don't have any single friends in Philippines (for a possible hook up), the single American must be open to Filipino dating websites. You'll need to bring your laptop to meetups to get advice or assistance with screening potential dating mates.  We have good advice for weeding out scammers and women looking for money only. \n\nIf you are interested or know someone interested, please join.  See you soon. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI'm Erica, the group organizer.  I'm from Philipines and I live in NYC with my American fiance.  I also went through the long K-1 visa journey process. \n\nI'm Vlane, Co-organizer Erica's American fiance. There is a growing demand for American's to date outside the country and outside their race.  The divorce rate is too high with American men with American women.   It's sad that so many men are married 2-4 times before they figure out there is a pattern.  A loyal filipino female will stay with you forever and treat you how you are suppose to be treated.  Every American citizen has a right to marry a female from another country and bring her over here. \nThere is a growing demand for these types of relationships.  Single American's get on board for the next generation of dating and marriages. \n\nSee you soon.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182503568,"name":"Erica Marcelo","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/highres_244821015.jpeg","photo_id":244821015,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/member_244821015.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/2\/1\/7\/thumb_244821015.jpeg"}},"members":32,"name":"Filipino K-1 Visa couples & Americans for marriage.

Do you already speak a foreign language (English counts if it's your second language) at an ADVANCED BEGINNER or HIGHER level?&nbsp; <br><\/b><b>2. Are you tired of going to the same old boring language schools\/meetups with students who are lazy and more often than not simply resort to speaking English? <br>3.

While teaching English and studying Chinese in Shanghai, China for a year in 2014 and 2015, I realized a very important thing about language learning: THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME FLUENT IS TO DO THE REALLY HARD THINGS THAT YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS FORCED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example: <br>* read books; <br>* write essays; <br>* do grammar and vocab exercises <br>* have in-depth conversations with a focus on grammatical accuracy <br>* give presentations; <br>* watch movies; <br>* listen to the radio; <br>* listen to native speakers seminars;&nbsp; <br>And (this is the key)... ALL IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>No schools I know do this. I have never been to a language program that required me to read a novel and write a five-page essay about it. I have never been to a language program that brought in native speakers to give presentations on unique topics. &nbsp;I have never been to a language program that provided ample opportunity to practice speaking with classmates on topics that will bring me closer to fluency. &nbsp;This list goes on. <br> <br>In other words, no other language program or group really forces you to do the things that will make you fluent. So I created it myself. &nbsp;Here. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>One of my goals in life is to speak at least ten languages, and at least five fluently. I created this group to help us all reach our fluency goals. All in a fun, social, environment WHERE ENGLISH IS RARELY USED. While this group introduction is in English, and the meetup descriptions on the site are in English, each group's activities (aside from oral instructions) are exclusively in the target language. Note: the Mandarin Meetup uses Hanzi almost exclusively so if you speak but don't read\/write, be prepared!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bottom line: If you are serious about taking your foreign language skills from 'pretty good' to 'ABSOLUTELY AWESOME', come join us. :) &nbsp;Each meeting will be well organized, well thought out, efficient, and effective. &nbsp;You will leave each of our meetups with tangible improvement. &nbsp;Some of our meetups focus on speaking; some on listening; some on reading; some on writing. &nbsp;They all will challenge you to be better than you were when you first arrived. <br> <br>CURRENT LANGUAGES: Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic <br>COMING SOON: Many many more: if you study a different language, join us, and let me know when you register. &nbsp;I'm keeping track of members' languages so as soon as there are enough people for other languages, I will add them!&nbsp; <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Please do NOT attend our events if you are a total beginner or can't have at the very least a basic conversation.&nbsp; VERY LITTLE ENGLISH WILL BE SPOKEN AT EVENTS. &nbsp;This is not a language school as much as it is a fluency school. &nbsp;Bring your intermediate\/advanced skills and let us together help you reach total fluency! &nbsp;I will bring all materials to each Meetup! <br> <br>If this all sounds interesting...

Hearings, requests for interviews from state and federal departments, testimony from individuals related to a news worthy event. If you know of a news worthy event YOU want to attend\/document, please let me know and with in reason I will post it, if you don't show up to your own suggested news event, you lose the right to suggest items. Please note, news worthy events will not necessarily be local to Somerset county! I find there are too many state and federal agencies that want the public to just go away and not ask questions. News media is not about entering a subject with a story to tell. It is about taking the chaos of a subject you might not be familiar with and making a story out of it. It is the foundation of film making, but it is not, it is reporting what you find and making a coherent story of it. Local news papers have been cut to the bare bone, and rarely do investigative reporting. This is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULES OF REPORTING FOR MEETUP: <br>RULE #1: You are not a participant, you are a reporter of the news, you do not place your self in danger, you do not place others in danger, you do not personally comment on situations or editorialize, you cover others at the event talking. They are the subject, not any of us in the meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #2: If you want to make sure what you want get's published, either publish it your self on social media, or, convince someone in the group or outside of the group to publish. Just because you are part of the group, does not mean anyone has any obligation to contribute to your work. This is a loosely based meetup.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #3: Bring your skills. If you like being a reporter, if you want to do audio engineering, if you want to write music with true current social meaning, then this is an opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #4: Try to share your skills with others, there will always be video to produce, if you want to do video production, audio production, anything in the stream to create a news worthy news piece, this is your opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #5: Do this because you enjoy it, try to have fun, help others, try make meaning of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p>RULE #6: We attend public meeting using Open Meeting Law, in New Jersey this means you can only video speakers or officials, due to NJ draconian laws the public in a meeting has a 'right to privacy' at a meeting. In New York all present at meeting may be recorded. Recording can not interfere with an orderly meeting. NOTE: Every meeting will generate media to produce, I will generate it and provide it under Creative Commons, so if you are downstream of Video and Audio capture, don't worry, you will always have at least my work to work with. This is the second group I have founded, the first being \"(All Volunteer) Independent News Media\". <br>The idea is to, for example, if there is a hearing in Union County, to have it announced on all groups, so if you are the only member in Union wanting to attend, you would not be alone, you with luck would have some video and audio people from the Middlesex or Sommerset group helping out and vice-versa.<\/p>\n<p>I have been doing this for over two years now, and at times, major news papers will pick up the story and publish video made by freelancers like us. Equipment is not required, but $100 will get you some good equipment. One of my last video \"Feb 19th 2015: Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka wants Cami Anderson to remove herself from office.\" was done on under $500 of equipment all bought used off of Ebay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>I started this group when I found out that out of a city of 6+ million, there was no planned coverage of THE Post Ambrose LNG public hearing in Queens. It does not matter if you are a Conservative, Liberal, Progressive or any other affiliation. If you want to get involved with video production, this is an opportunity.
