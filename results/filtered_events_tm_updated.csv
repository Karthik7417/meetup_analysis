A component of Abstract Algebra, CT strives to find powerful generalizations and proofs that encompass logic, mathematics, and topology. More recently it is being applied to many forms of logic and semantic problems. Recent work by David Spivak on “Categorical Theory for Scientists” and “ Categorical Databases” has opened up interesting new ways to applying CT to many kinds of data query and analytic applications. All of logic (FOL, HOL, boolean, Heyting algebra, subclassifiers) is within the realm of CT, but it can be used to map data models from one system to another (ontology alignment and data migration), as well as generate new constructs (cartesian products). A key feature identified by Spivak is that RDF can be described in CT as a Grothendieck Construction, representing both typed set values and relations (fundamental elements of CT), thereby preserving data meaning (graph structure) throughout information processes.    Dr. Neumann is Vice President of Knowledge Informatics at Foundation Medicine, where he is responsible for organizing FMI’s knowledge assets. He is a recognized world expert in semantic information and data modeling for life sciences, and has worked on many information initiatives for the pharmaceutical and life sciences, including the W3C Semantic Web Healthcare and Life Science Interest Group (HCLSIG).  Eric has been a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies on how to improve their management of scientific and pharmacological information. Prior to FMI, Eric was a founder and CTO of PanGenX, a personalized medicine company. Eric was also the Global Head of Knowledge Management for Scientific and Medical Affairs within Sanofi-Aventis, overseeing the reuse of knowledge and insights across a multinational company.  Eric is a graduate from MIT and holds a PhD in neurobiology, developmental genetics, and pharmacology from Case Western Reserve University.","09 Jun 2015","18:00","32 Vassar Street Cambridge",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Dan Lynn, CEO, AgilDataCory Isaacson, CTO, Risk Management Solutions A Database Month eventhttp://www.DatabaseMonth.com/database/agile-data The web app is Agile. The REST API is Agile. The testing and planning are Agile. But alas, Data infrastructures certainly are not. Once an application matures, changing the shape or indexing scheme of data often forces at best a top-down planning exercise and at worst includes schema changes which force downtime. This talk will discuss solutions to some of the problems faced by software organizations as their products become successful and the data grows beyond the initial scope of the database, whether it starts out as relational SQL, NoSQL, or somewhere in-between. As the user base of a software system grows, the data infrastructure is forced to evolve to meet the needs of new features, increasing the variety of data with ever larger data volumes and higher query velocity. One thing we know about evolution is that it doesn't always take the simple path or produce simple results. Data systems often grow by adding technology: a little NoSQL here, a message queue there, a Hadoop cluster hiding in the corner. This growing complexity slows down product development and challenges technology teams to ramp up entirely new skillsets reactively. Is this your future or is this your today? Address these challenges, with a truly agile infrastructure that allows your organization to store, scale and access the data it needs. We will cover the concept of an 'Agile data infrastructure', able to handle everything from OLTP to real-time analytics to historical reporting. A truly Agile approach allows data to be accessed as an exact match to application requirements. As application needs change, an Agile platform must be able to respond rapidly and dynamically evolve the schema, data distribution and access patterns to support high scalability with high performance - while easing the burden of the application developer and database administrators. We will also highlight real a real-world use case from a large enterprise organization that was able to leverage an agile data approach to rapidly accelerate the pace of product development while actually simplifying operations. We'll make you a believer in the fundamental tenants of an agile big data infrastructure, namely that it must be Simple, it must be Scaleable, it must be Streaming, and, most importantly, it must be SQL. Dan Lynn, CEO of AgilData, formerly CodeFutures Corporation, is an entrepreneur, technologist, teacher and technical leader with 14 years of experience in the software industry. He joins AgilData to advance the agile Big Data strategies in development around AgilData, CodeFutures' new agile Big Data platform designed to remove the complexity and limitations of current data management approaches.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.   Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative. Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.  Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.

4319,4271,1336198,"qfpgmhytkbsb","********************************** Agenda: ********************************** Semantic Standards Enable Financial Data Synergy David Blaszkowsky, SVP, Head of Data Governance, State Street  David Saul, SVP and Chief Scientist, State Street  ABSTRACT Financial services companies want to develop new data analytics products and services for their clients. The increasing complexity and cost of global regulatory compliance diverts attention and resources from those efforts. The development of data standards, through industry partnerships like the Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Council, when combined with semantic technologies creates a synergy that can address both requirements. Development of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) from a regulatory mandate is one example of how public/private collaboration can work to the benefit of both. The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) is an emerging standard from the Object Management Group (OMG) that exploits semantics to describe data so that it can be used for both data analytics and risk management. Semantic data standards enhance data governance through their ability to create transparency both internally and externally. ABOUT THE SPEAKERS David M. Blaszkowsky joined State Street in 2014 from the Office of Financial Research, US Department of the Treasury, where he was Senior Policy Advisor, working on data and technology issues related to financial institution and systemic risk, including standards, data strategy, and emerging data technologies.  Prior to joining the OFR, the Securities and Exchange Commission appointed David in October 2007 as Director of its new Office of Interactive Disclosure, which developed and implemented interactive data rules, standards (particularly XBRL), and analytical tools for SEC financial disclosures. At both the SEC and OFR, David co-created and helped promote the adoption of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), as an original member of the “Linchpin” team.  Before his stints in government, David managed several equity research and analytics businesses for Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. Before that, he was the director of strategic planning and development for McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group, held finance and reengineering roles at Fidelity Investments, and was a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and Gemini.  David received his B.A. in Economics at the University of Chicago, and his MBA in Finance at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.  David lives in Boston with his wife and two daughters. David Saul is Senior Vice President and Chief Scientist at State Street Corporation, reporting to the Chief Information Officer.  In this role, he is responsible for proposing and assessing new advanced technologies for the organization as well as evaluating technologies already in use at State Street and their likely evolution in order to reinforce the organization’s leadership position in financial services.  Mr. Saul previously was Chief Information Security Officer, where he oversaw State Street’s corporate information security program, controls and technology.  Prior to that, he managed State Street’s Office of Architecture, where he was responsible for the overall enterprise technology, data and security architecture of the corporation.  Mr. Saul joined State Street in 1992 after 15 years with IBM’s Cambridge Scientific Center, where he managed innovations in operating systems virtualization, multiprocessing, networking and personal computers.  Mr. Saul serves as a Trustee of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.  In 2007 he was honored with a Computerworld Premier 100 IT Leader Award.  American Banker named Mr. Saul as one of its Top Innovators of 2013 for his work on data semantics and standards.  Mr. Saul holds Bachelors and Master’s degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","14 Jul 2015","18:00","32 Vassar Street Cambridge",7,"busiest, market, technological, manage, new, companies, develop, year, product, inform"

7006,8306,18641651,"224282558","This month Sinan Bolel will present the Firebase platform for developing applications from MVP to scale. Here is the Firebase Pitch: Firebase is a platform that powers your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more. Firebase enables you to build fast by reducing the complexity of full-stack applications, allowing you to focus on what matters: creating extraordinary user experiences. In his talk he will endeavor to answer the following questions: What is Firebase, what makes it different, and why is it important? •  What makes Firebase + AngularJS + Node.js an awesome stack? • What does one need to know in order to use Firebase? •  What are examples of what Firebase can be used to accomplish? •  How well does Firebase perform in various example contexts? •  Does Firebase work at both the MVP stage and at scale? The talk will focus on Implementing powerful realtime applications with Firebase, AngularJS, and a dash of Node.js, Also included will be a discussion of adding Firebase to your full-stack workflow, building a client-only app with ease using AngularFire, integrating Firebase with Node.js to achieve autonomous functionality, and transitioning from an MVP to an application at scale. We will also explore examples of applications currently using Firebase, and live-code a full-stack app with Firebase, AngularJS, and a hint of Node.js. Sinan received his B.S. in computer science from Northwestern University in 2014 and has been building realtime applications with Firebase ever since. His background is in computer systems and interfaces, with a focus on databases, wireless sensor networks, and human computer interaction. He is returning to Northwestern for his masters to study realtime systems and spatio-temporal databases. Sinan loves the smell of gasoline and quotes lines from ""the Fast and the Furious"" often.","17 Aug 2015","18:30","2072 Somerville Rd Annapolis",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Abstract -    Throughout my career, I’ve seen developers do some pretty   crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I’ve done   some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what   we do and why it’s bad to the database server (or your   career)… and alternatives that can be used instead. Some   of the topics that we’ll discuss are the pitfalls of using   NOLOCK, how coding mistakes open up the database for SQL   Injection attacks, and how design choices keep SQL Server   dumb – and if it was allowed to be smart, it would be   faster!

Food and refreshments will be provided on the second floor of WeWork at 745 Atlantic Avenue. A big thanks to WeWork South Station for offering their space and free beer. Distributed System Analysis using a little TLC and ElasticSearch A short presentation on our Distributed System Analysis efforts to facilitate indexing Telemetry, Log, and Configuration data to enable deeper analysis of complex distributed systems. We all are working with ever increasing levels of complexity in our distributed systems as the need for more and more compute power and more storage grows. We describe the work we have done so far to build a warehouse for performance analysis, letting us separate visualization and reporting from collection and normalization, while providing a foundation for applying machine learning techniques. We'll walk through how we collect and normalize Telemetry data into ElasticSearch, along with Log data, and then how we collect and normalize configuration data.  We show some of our work to enable Grafana to visualize the telemetry data, and demonstrate a performance analysis tool, pbench, which wraps benchmarks runs indexing them as discrete results sets, enabling a flexible web UI for visualization and reporting (nvd3 based). This work is in its very early stages, so there will be lots of duct tape, band-aids, paper-clips, chewing gum, and bees-wax used to keep it all together. :) Speaker Peter Portante is a Software Engineer at Red Hat.

Factor models can be used to determine your algorithm’s exposure to risk, or to construct arbitrage strategies. An example of a factor model could be using the price of oil, treasury rate, and a national stability index to predict the returns of every stock in the S&amp;P 500. During this meetup, we will discuss how to implement factor models and different ways they can be useful for strategy research and design. This talk is part of Quantopian’s Summer Lecture Series. We are currently developing a quant finance curriculum and will be releasing clone-able notebooks and algorithms to go along with this lecture.  Pizza and beer will be served.

This is a weekly project night is for dreamers, technologists, designers, developers, data scientists, map makers, and activists who are working on ""civic technology"" projects. Consider this to be a study hall or office hours to improve yourself and the city. This night is for those who want to:   * work on projects  * explore NYC BigApps problems  * start a new project, or find one to join  * get feedback from experts  * learn about tools for local empowerment, open data, and open government Bring your laptop, power supply, ideas, projects, maps, data, and questions. Collectively, we will try to answer them. 


 === Hacknight resources === For first timers trying to get the most out of the night, you should bring your laptop, watch Civic Hacking 101, Civic Hacking 102, and review our projects page. * Working Groups - Developers' Corner, CityGram.NYC, City Record Online, &amp; MTA Service Alerts * Data tools: Data.Beta.NYC, data resources, maps, &amp; tools * Community projects in process - projects.beta.nyc

Plug it into this event's comments section! 


 === Special Guests === For this hacknight and along with your projects, we will feature New York City Council Speaker's Office, our NYC BigApps colleagues. For the last three years, the New York City Council has been working on a new kind of municipal budgeting: Participatory Budgeting. Affectionately called “PB”, residents in a growing number of Council districts decided how to spend millions of dollars in taxpayer money on neighborhood projects, such as playground improvements and technology for public schools. This year, the Council is bringing PB to NYC BigApps 2015 as a Civic Engagement Challenge Partner. On August 5th, representatives from the Office of Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito will be attending BetaNYC’s hacknight to discuss their challenges and outline their user stories. Join us at Civic Hall to work on your NYC BigApps projects or to hear more about the Participatory Budgeting process (from idea generation to neighborhood voting) and to find out what kinds of civic engagement solutions you can build to help amplify the voices of New Yorkers! 


 === Event Partners ===  The Code for America Brigade program is an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better. Microsoft Civic aims to collaboratively address the most pressing community challenges through the hyper-local creation, deployment, and evangelism of civic technology.

Abstract:  In this talk, Henri Dwyer will guide the audience through analyzing real educational data, taken from Ryan Baker's MOOC: Big Data in Education. Ryan Baker was our previous speaker and if you want to have some hands on experience about the data he talked about, this meetUp is for you.  The goal of this talk is to show how data scientists go from the data to actually gaining insights and making predictions, and to teach how to do it. First, Henri Dwyer will lay down the foundations and data science concepts necessary to understand the analysis. Next, he will construct data science workflows using Python and Data Science Studio to analyze data ranging from detecting students that are gaming the system, to identifying sequences of student events and how they affect behavior. 


Speaker Bio:  Henri Dwyer is a data scientist and engineer working on building the best platform for data scientists at Dataiku. Before, he did physics research on air pollution and solar cells. He received an MSc in Engineering from Columbia University and a BS and an Ms in Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.

12805,19564,3357852,"224521168","We're all shooting a lot of video with our aircraft - what to do with all that beautiful footage? For many the flying and capture is the easy part, but sitting down with software like Final Cut Pro X or Adobe Premiere can be daunting. This 3 hour event is meant to remove the veil of mystery about video editing. How to structure, time, and edit your footage is really where the magic happens. Just because we have the tools, doesn't make us filmmakers. Our guests (to be announced) will give us real world examples of compelling aerial footage and why it works and how to incorporate filmic thought into your work. Our guest this evening is Jeff Brink, co founder of Aerocine, now Aerobo. For those not familiar, Aerobo was one of the first companies exempted and approved by the FAA to fly UAS commercially in the US. They are also the first production company to be permitted to fly in NYC. Jeff is going to deconstruct some of the videos he has cut for Aerobo and describe his process. How he sorts clips, naming conventions, storage and retrieval practices, and how he begins previsualizing a timeline. He will then demonstrate different techniques and effects providing the terminology and jargon used in editing practice culminating in the reconstructed edit of the Aerobo show reel. Jeff has also offered to take a member's raw footage and edit a short piece as we watch. If you are interested in having your raw footage transformed into an edited short piece at the event please submit a dropbox file, vimeo, or you tube link with the raw footage. Note: we aren't promising a final product. Your footage will be used to demonstrate how raw footage is winnowed down into a stellar edit. Jeff requests that the links be provided before hand so he can preview the footage and begin the previsualization process. This is not a platform specific talk, no need to bring your laptop loaded with any particular application, but an overview of the editor's process and how his methods can apply to your work. Editing is hugely time-consuming and starts with good footage. The edit, music, and titles bring the whole package together to evoke emotion. There will be ample time to socialize before and after Jeff's talk as well as Q&amp;A. This event is free and thanks in large part to the generosity of ENJOY, our hosts for the evening goenjoy.com","27 Aug 2015","18:30","324 Lafayette St New York",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

Dr. Sameena Shah is a Director of Research for Thomson Reuters and heads the R&amp;D NY site. Prior to this role, she worked at a StatArb hedge fund in NYC, and a startup. Sameena is a cofounder of Cocoa Compassion, a social enterprise. Sameena holds a PhD in Machine Learning from IIT Delhi, which was judged as the top one for India for 2010 by Microsoft Research. She holds a Masters in Computer Applications and B.Tech in Electronics Engineering. Sameena has published more than 20 papers and is on the review panel of major CS/EE journals and conferences. Abstract: How do you find out what is happening in the world ? Traditionally, the answer has been traditional media organizations. However, these days most people will agree that Twitter has become a big part of the news generation and dissemination process. While Twitter is being used, however the process of news discovery is almost universally rudimentary; limited to searching using keywords that one may think of. Thomson Reuters R&amp;D along with our Reuters news division, has built a ground up technology that automates the news discovery process from social sources. Sameena, who led the research and development of this product, will highlight the machine learning and NLP algorithms contribution in this breakthrough technology. Joyce Shen is the Director of Emerging Technology Partnerships &amp; Investments at Thomson Reuters. She leads the enterprise CTO efforts on emerging technology trends, partnerships, and investments globally.  Before joining Thomson Reuters, Joyce was the founding member and CFO of the Cloud Platform Services division (Bluemix) at IBM.  Joyce holds bachelor’s degrees in Statistics and Economics from the University of Chicago and an MBA degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

And yes, we'll have a countdown timer this time! Here's a look at the agenda: Marc Sewtz - Configuring PDF printing with APEX 5.0 and ORDS: This session will show you how to configure PDF printing using APEX 5.0 and ORDS and how this compares to using BI Publisher or Apache FOP. We’ll look at printing Interactive Reports and Classic Reports, as well as producing PDFs using the APEX print APIs and attaching generated PDF reports to emails send from within your APEX application. Tim Chambers - The inner workings of our new APEX 5 JS widgets: APEX 5 and Universal Theme have considerable Javascript dedicated to improving the UX of your apps. This presentation will cover some of this front-end logic from a technical standpoint, to elucidate the kinds of calculations that occur on page load and on page runtime. Patrick Maniraho - Advanced Data Loading Features: Oracle Application Express has had a ""data loading"" feature since version 4.1. Subsequent releases have added features to improve the data loading experience and performance. Some of these improvements include column name aliases (which can be used to overcome the 45 columns limit), the ability to map more than one spreadsheet column into one table column, advanced transformation rules, the ability to skip some steps (useful for larger set of records), better management of concurrency, and improved error handling. In this session, we will walk through some examples to highlight these advanced features and tricks that can be used to improve the usability and performance of data loading. Dan McGhan - Relational to JSON in Oracle Database: There’s no shortage of options when it comes generating JSON from relational data in Oracle Database. In this session I’ll introduce you to several options, from lower level PL/SQL based solutions like PL/JSON and APEX_JSON to higher level solutions that do more than just generate and parse JSON like Oracle REST Data Services and Node.js with the Oracle Database driver.

The reason it says it's maxed out, is because I can't sign you up through meetup.com. To RSVP, please send an email to alfred dot vachris at gmail dot com, with your first and last name. A photo ID is mandatory. You will receive an email once a month from the Microsoft Organizer. We plan on meeting on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, but there are changes occasionally. You should receive an email, if there's a cancellation. The Conference Center's security department, requires your first and last name, so please include your full name, within the body of your email. Sometimes, the map on this meetup link above, is incorrect, so please write down the address, (at 41st Street and 8th Avenue, NorthEast corner... i.e. not in Port Authority). If you don't get an email back from anyone, within a day or two, please send a 2nd request. I always learn something new at the group, like an advanced feature, or a glitch/bug to beware of. For example, did you know that formulas entered in the Named Range box calculate as ""Array Entered"". It's OK, to arrive half an hour early and use the free coffee machine. Try to go early, if it's your first time, in case you are not registered properly. If you arrive, and the the security personnel informs you of a registration problem, don't be alarmed, they will assist you. Please be patient. This event is scheduled for 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM.

We are again having 5-minute lightning talks.  If you are interested in giving a 5-minute talk, please send a proposal containing the title and a brief description to [masked] by August 9. Civic Hall is located at 156 5th Avenue on the northwest corner of 20th Street on the second floor.  Be sure to take the elevator bank furthest from the 5th avenue entrance to best access the space.  Should you have any trouble, feel free to ask the doorman for the West Elevators! He's happy to help.   Because we are meeting in Civic Hall, we no longer need to use an external registration system.  Registering through meetup.com is sufficient, and we will be accepting walk-up attendees the day of the event.  Please register early so we know how much pizza to get. Agenda • 6pm: Doors open, pizza served, courtesy of Bloomberg • 6:30pm: Speakers: Stephen Taylor (Correlation Matrix Filtering and Clustering with Python), Jason Grout (SageMathCloud - Mathematical Computing in the Cloud), and Spencer Lyon (QuantEcon: Economics Meets Open Source, as well as a bit about the Julia language) • 7:40pm: Lightning talks: Tom Caswell (on matplotlib), Amanda Yang and Harris Cullinan (on data mining and machine learning at VICE), and Adam Hajari (on Spyre) • 8:00pm: Reception • 9:00pm: End of meetup Abstracts Stephen Taylor, Correlation Matrix Filtering and Clustering with Python. Correlation matrices provide a means of encoding pairwise dependency relationships between time series and are a key input parameter into a wide variety of financial models. However, they are prone to estimation error due to outliers and poor estimates may have significant impact on subsequent model results. We examine one technique for reducing this error as well as a method for extracting structure from the correlation matrix by use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Specifically, we first specify, download, and wrangle, end of day price time series for the majority of exchange traded US equity securities from Yahoo! Finance. Next, we review a result in random matrix theory of Marcenko and Pastur about the distribution of eigenvalues of correlation matrices constructed from random time series as well as financial applications of their result by Bouchaud and Potters. These ideas are then applied to filtering a correlation matrix constructed from the end of day stock prices. Next, we use an hierarchical clustering algorithm on the filtered correlation matrix in to order its columns and extract sector information of the stocks’ time series using only their price data. We finally comment on a few interesting facts that we find as a result.  Stephen Taylor enjoys using Python for applied data analysis and statistics projects. He holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, an M.S. in Mathematics, an M.S. in Physics, and a Ph.D. in quantitative finance from SUNY Stony Brook and the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. He has served as an industry student project advisor for the University of Chicago and NYU Quantitative Finance programs. He also has worked as a Quantitative Researcher at Bloomberg, was on the research staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, was a fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley, and worked in the quantitative research group at Hutchin Hill Capital.  Jason Grout, SageMathCloud - Mathematical computing in the cloud. Sage (sagemath.org) is a comprehensive open-source mathematical software distribution based on Python.  SageMathCloud (cloud.sagemath.com) is an open-source web platform for using the Sage mathematical software.  It provides, among other things, full collaborative editing in the Sage notebook, the IPython notebook, an online TeX editor, and a Unix shell, as well as frequent snapshots of data, public sharing of projects, and a course management system for educators using the platform in the classroom.  We will discuss both Sage and the SageMathCloud platform.  Jason Grout is a professional software developer at Bloomberg.  He develops systems using Python and web technologies for interactive scientific computing and data exploration.  He has contributed extensively to the SageMath and IPython/Jupyter open-source projects, and is a member of the IPython steering council.  He earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Brigham Young University and formerly was an assistant professor of mathematics at Drake University, where he used technology extensively in teaching. Spencer Lyon, QuantEcon: economics meets open source.  In this talk we will explore QuantEcon (quant-econ.net), a collaborative effort to bring open source teaching materials and tools to economics. QuantEcon is composed of two main components: 1. a website containing teaching lectures and 2. performance oriented software libraries in Python and Julia.  We will also discuss why we are early adopters of the Julia language. We will examine the characteristics that make Julia unique and explain why we feel these strengths are useful for economists. Finally, we will describe why we believe Julia and Python have a future together.  Spencer Lyon is between years 2–3 of an economics PhD program at NYU Stern. He has a background in physics. Spencer’s research interests are broadly contained in the subfield of macro-economics, with particular emphasis on asset pricing and international topics. Spencer is a devoted open source hacker who works on various Python and Julia projects. He is a lead developer for the quant-econ project.","11 Aug 2015","18:00","156 5th Ave New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based metaphor for idea flow. However, Beaker was designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple different languages that communicate with one another through a unique feature called autotranslation. You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell, and everything just works, magically. Beaker comes with built-in support for Python, R, Scala, Groovy, Julia, and Javascript. In addition, Beaker also supports multiple kinds of cells for text, like HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, and a unique visualization library that allows for the plotting of large data sets. This talk will motivate the design, review the architecture, and include a live demo of Beaker in action.

This month's fly-in is more than fun, it's civic minded. Thanks to the kind folks at The Trust For Governor's Island, we have been invited to fly over the island. What a beautiful site and with amazing backdrops of NYC, Statue Of Liberty, etc. Ferry Service begins at 10:00a - we may be able to get some golf cart type transport on the island but don't count on it. There will be specific parts of the island for us to fly above and around but be warned there will be other people enjoying the island while we are there. There will be a mandatory ceiling of 200 feet and no flight over the monument area of the island.  I will be posting further info in advance of this event. With all the negative press about our hobby/profession/passion, this is an opportunity for our group to demonstrate what safe, responsible UAS activity is all about. There will likely be press/media there so bring your 'A' game! Also working to invite members of the NYC legislature in the hopes of influencing policy decisions. We are the ambassadors of UAS in NYC! PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE THE EVENT AND ALL UPDATES MORE INFO as of 08/03/2015 thanks for everyone's excitement, suggestions, and questions. As you might imagine this is an important event. With the recent negative press around UAS and stupid people doing stupid things with drones around JFK, the leadership team is going through some flaming hoops to ensure that we have a safe and fun event. After consideration and discussion, we agree that this is not a flying event for beginners. Some of you have asked that very question, which we respect and are grateful for. If you feel that flying in potential high winds in a very restricted and monitored area is not what you are up to please don't make this event your proving ground. We do encourage beginners to come and learn from our more experienced members. Anyone that has been to our fly-ins knows how helpful and friendly we are. We are also in need of volunteers to act as safety officers and software checkers. A great opportunity to get involved. As stated before, we will be maintaining a 200ft ceiling with a radius of 250m. The monument area at the northern tip is a National Park and prohibited from being overflown. The island has several helicopter air routes running by the east, west and south and the Wall St heliport immediately due north. We request that no one fly beyond the land perimeter of the island out of respect to manned aviation. There will be a mandatory aircraft geo fence check on the Manhattan side prior to boarding the ferry. If your aircraft does not have the ability to create a ceiling and perimeter via GPS, it will not be permitted on the island. Operators must show safety officers their settings of 200ft ceiling and 250m perimeter in order to board with a drone.  By coincidence, National Model Aviation Day is August 15th - what better way to celebrate it! Here is a link with more information - donations go to The Wounded Warrior Project: http://nationalmodelaviationday.org/ UPDATED INFO 8/10/2015 Some updates on how the event will unfold: Due to the high turnout expected we will be issuing lanyards and wristbands. Wristbands will be color coded and denote a particular takeoff and landing zone on a map that will be provided at check - in on the NYC side of the ferry.  Check-in will be done on a first-come, first-served basis. There are a limited number of flight slots per location. A wristband and lanyard indicate that your aircraft has been checked and you are assured of at least one flight on the island. Note that we have added an hour to the event's duration to accommodate more flying. Each flying site will be color coded and coordinate to the color of your wrist band. Time permitting you may be able to fly at another spot but only after everyone with the original color tag has flown. Your lanyard tag will be marked by safety officers to indicate you have had a turn in the air and at which station. Actual flying sites on the island will be determined after scouting takes place end of day tomorrow. We are currently instituting a ""Snooze, You Lose"" policy. You must be checked in, have a wrist band and lanyard, and be on the 10:00a ferry in order to fly at this event. This does not apply to spectators. We currently do not have the man power to have someone stay on the Manhattan side to check in late comers. This may change based on actual turnout but this is the policy at the moment. Please do not board the next ferry with your drone expecting to fly on the island. You will experience the wrath of those that arrived early! Please have your aircraft ready to be powered up (no props) and your smartphone app open to show your failsafe as ""return to home"", your altitude ceiling at 200ft or the metric equivalent, and a range of 250m. No exceptions. IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT 8/12/2015 There are several factors affecting our time frame for the event: The first ferry to the island departs The Battery Terminal at 10:00a. By the time we reach the flying site on the island - a map will be posted here beforehand and printed for your reference - it will be near 10:30. There is an event going on in the ""Old Town"" section (no overflight) - a Jazz Age music festival with people dressed in period 1920's costume. It doesn't begin until noon but its certain that some of the people going to that event will be boarding the 10:00 ferry. We currently have no mechanism in place for late arrivals. If you are not on the 10:00 ferry, please do not board with an aircraft thinking you can slip in. Wristbands and lanyards are what gets you to the flight line. With so many operators interested in flying, we must state once again that this is not an event for beginners. Not sure if you're a beginner? Can you fly figure 8's, land ""nose in"", know what ""nose in"" means? We just cannot stress this enough. This is a high profile public event and a lot of important 3 letter agencies are scrutinizing from near and far. We will be issuing lanyards to the first 70 operators that show our screeners (like the TSA but for god's sake leave your shoes on) your failsafe, RTH, flight ceiling and radius parameters on your control app or other interface.  FAILSAFE - Return to home, Flight Ceiling 200 feet, flight distance radius 250 meters or equivalent. We will not have time to help you find the screens and make the settings - please do this in advance of your arrival at the Ferry Terminal. Have your app launched and your aircraft powered without props. Be patient and kind to all volunteers. We are here for your safety and the safety of others on the island. If you're not ready we may need to send you back in line until you are. Flight intervals have been reduced to 10 min per turn in the air. We feel that for all the effort you are making to come to this event, it is better for everyone to get a chance to fly more but not all at once. Go get coffees for everyone, hydrate, put some sunscreen on and talk to your fellow enthusiasts. We have so much to learn from one another. Revel in the wonder of it all and then maybe fly again. There will be demarcated flight stations with traffic cones and a spectator line for everyone else to remain behind. Operators may have one person beside them for spotting or coaching but no one else may interfere with the operator while flying. Lastly, several of you are asking - ""can I go higher than 200 feet?"" No. I scouted the island yesterday afternoon and the staff are very excited to have us do what we do best. Lets be exemplary in our behavior and observe the rules we have set. There is no overflight of the monument area where the ferry landing and old town and fort are. Maps will clearly demarcate what is out of bounds. There is and will be a tremendous amount of manned helicopter flight at altitudes that are quite low all around the island. Please do not fly past the boundary of land on the island - if you do, you will be asked to land immediately and will surrender your wristband and lanyard preventing you from any further flight activity. In addition you will be ridiculed by your peers and referred to as ""that guy"" or ""that girl"" for the remainder of the day and shamed publicly on the internet. Seriously, don't do it.  Please be respectful of spectators and passersby do not fly behind the flight line.  There is likely to be press/media there. Have smart things to say, and demonstrate good aeronautical decision making by keeping distance from other craft and not traversing the entire flight area - stay in your part of the sky. Lastly, be nice and be patient - our team of leaders and volunteers has put a lot of effort in to making this a kick-ass event for no other compensation than knowing they did their part to demonstrate their passion for UAS.  See you there!

Flight stations will be set up by color code. Your wrist band indicates which station you will queue up for. Wrist bands will be numbered but does not indicate the order of flight since some will arrive after others - so once again, first come first served. The volunteer team will do their best to get to the site first and set up - your help and patience is required. The area marked in green is where we are permitted to base our operations. Orange indicates high density of people expected and where food and drink may be procured. Pink is no fly monument zone. This part of the island is a national park.  The area directly to the north of us is likely to have people in some spots especially as it gets later in the day. Please be conscious to not fly over/near people. Lastly but not leastly, volunteers will be accepting your donations to The Wounded Warrior Project in conjunction with the Academy of Model Aeronautics. Please see the links below and make  contribution with us or online, or both.

Quantum Interface (Qi), based in Austin, TX, has developed what it says is the world’s first and only dynamic predictive user interface. Functionally,  a dynamic predictive user interface uses directional vectors of speed, time, and angle change (instead of fixed, absolute Cartesian coordinates),  to anticipate a users intent. The company says that by leveraging NUI principals, a dynamic predictive user interface is not only the most natural, but being faster than a human is physiologically able to react, is the fastest and easiest UI in the world. Qi CTO/Founder Jonathan Josephson will be presenting live demos of touchless interfaces including eye and body and a new HUD demo that will show the future of the Automotive UIX. The presentation will provide an understanding of how the basic geometry of nature and motion is implemented into future concepts, as well as how it's being implemented into current beta releases, which will be demonstrated as well. 

Additionally, Jonathan will give insight into the design and development processes required to bring new UI’s to the market, as well as address questions regarding patent and trademark lessons learned, funding, and OEM/industry trends in this market. The audience is welcome to try the demos.   Jonathan Josephson is Founder and Chief Technology Officer at Quantum Interface where he spearheads development and design of the company’s motion-based UIX software. He began thinking about how people interact with their electronic devices in early 2000, which inspired creation of the company's next era of Natural User Interfaces. He has more than 25 years of experience creating technology innovations for government, contracting, home construction, and the Internet of Things, and has worked with products and projects in mobile and wearables, virtual reality, smart TVs, and connected automobiles. 8:00PM - 8:30PM - Hang Out - Network Share this event:  http://bit.ly/NUICen_NY28  @nuicen @qimotions Join NUI Central.com IMPORTANT : If you come to the event and you are not registered on the Meetup site by 3:00PM on the day of the Meetup, you will have to wait to the side to see if there's room to accommodate you.

First, Henri will describe the key concepts in predictive maintenance, as well as some applications. Next, he will build a workflow using data from the PHM society data challenge, showing how to go from raw data to the the final predictions. Henri will highlight how to avoid common pitfalls, give examples of what features can be engineered, what techniques and models can be used run to ultimately come up with a robust predictive maintenance model. Meet the Speaker:  Henri Dwyer is a data scientist and engineer working on building the best platform for data scientists at Dataiku. Before, he did physics research on air pollution and solar cells. He received an MSc in Engineering from Columbia University and a BS and an Ms in Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Henri now lives in New York City and is always keen on discovering new data science problems to solve. 


Text Understanding, Word2Vec, and Neural Networks Supervised text classification is hampered by the need to acquire expensive labeled training sets. By leveraging algorithms similar to Word2Vec and other neural network based text embedding algorithms one can create vector representations of documents that enable a model to be successfully trained with a drastically reduced training set. By using this technique the implementer can now devote low investment to acquiring a small volume of labeled data examples in order to train proximity thresholds, without devoting significant resources using traditional text classification algorithms which typically require training volume examples that are orders of magnitude larger. Meet the Speaker:  Mike Tamir serves as Chief Science Officer for Galvanize, supervising Galvanize's Immersive Education and accredited Masters Programing.  He has led several teams of Data Scientists in the bay area as Chief Data Scientist for InterTrust and as Director of Data Sciences for the Sears Holding Company.

The first iteration, Citygram One, focuses on exploring spatio-acoustic energies to reveal meaningful information including spatial loudness, traffic patterns, noise pollution, and emotion/mood through audio signal processing and machine learning techniques. Citygram aims to create a model for visualizing and applying computational techniques to produce metrics and further our knowledge of cities such as NYC and LA. The project will enable a richer representation and understanding of cities defined by humans, visible/invisible energies, buildings, machines, and other biotic/abiotic entities. Our freely Internet-accessible system will yield high impact results that are general enough for a wide range of applications for residents, businesses, and visitors to cities like NYC and LA. Our collaboration with NYU CUSP has been especially fruitful in the context of measuring and quantifying urban spatio-acoustic noise and using NYC as a research lab. Citygram-Sound Project is a collaboration between NYU Steinhardt, NYU CUSP,  and CalArts.

That raises the question ""can you test the conditional independence relationships and build a graphical model from a dataset?"" It's a hard problem in general, but we'll look at some approaches! We'll play with conditional mutual information and other independence tests, and play with some model inference packages to see how they do on some toy datasets. I'll post some references in the comments.

Unfortunately, you'll likely have trouble getting past security if you're late. Other notes about the group: This group is for anyone who wants to learn math! The philosophy is that you can apply an algorithm or analysis method best when you understand the theory behind it. Hence, we have a strong focus on theory, but with an eye toward application. We're an extremely informal group. While many of us are professionals in quantitative fields, none of us are necessarily experts in the topics we're covering. The hope is that we can all learn from both reading and group discussion.","19 Aug 2015","18:30","200 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor New York",3,"data, will, please, help, free, learn, day, can, follow, meet"

We wanted to provide our engineers with a local development environment that closely mirrored the production environment. We found that the whole local environment set up process could be greatly simplified by using automation tools such as Ansible and containerization tools such as Docker. In this talk we will go through the Dockerized development environment architecture, provide demos, and share what we've learned in the process. DigitalOcean One of Docker's strenghts is the consistent workflow and improved developer experience once you adopt it in your organization. However, what you might not realize is that once you wish to take your Dockerized application to production, there are a number of additional concerns that you need to start thinking about. This talk will dive in to what those concerns are and share ways in which you might want to think about when shipping Dockerized applications to production.

This talk will explore the ongoing effort to realize semantic interoperability in health information exchange. Healthcare providers are increasingly challenged to not only provide care for patients, but to also document their efforts often in excruciating detail. Meaningful Use has increased the urgency that providers develop and sustain these efforts. While an overriding goal of Meaningful Use is better health through better health information ultimately leading to improvements in healthcare delivery, there are many differences in the way medical information is conceptualized by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administration, and insurance companies. This is particularly critical during transitions of care (movement of a patient from one setting of care to another), but even when communication occurs, knowledge is not always shared, because sender and receiver attach different meanings to the same message. An important outcome of the Meaningful Use initiative is the standard and uniform representation of patient information across all certified EHRs. This topic is significant and timely for several reasons, especially as Meaningful Use entered a penalty phase in 2015.  Tomasz A. Adamusiak MD PhD is a Senior Data Scientist at Thomson Reuters, where he leads a global team responsible for pre-sales and post-sales support for Thomson Reuters big data solutions for top pharma, research, and financial institutions.

More information coming soon. Part 1 - Crosscloud -- a SoLiD effort to redecentralize the Web Andrei Sambra will talk about Crosscloud -- an exciting new project (lead by Sir Tim Berners-Lee) that involves redecentralizing the Web, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Crosscloud gives users the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it by decoupling content from the application itself. Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor lock-in by seamlessly switching the apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social connections. Crosscloud also enables developers to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data created by previous apps. Part 2 - Meet the TAG  The W3C TAG (Technical Architecture Group http://w3.org/tag) is in charge of coordinating cross-technology architecture and the principles of web architecture at the World Wide Web Consortium - in other words, it’s kind of a technical steering group for web standards. We’re having a face to face meeting in September in Cambridge (hosted at W3C’s offices at MIT). As part of our time here we'll be holding a Q&amp;A panel session (followed by drinks &amp; snacks) on the evening of September 14th where we can let you know what we're up to and get feedback from the web developer community about your priorities. Come along find out what we're working on, get a heads-up of new Web standards and technologies in development and air your web tech pet peeves. Key topics on the agenda will be the rise (and rise) of https and web security in general, API design, privacy and browser fingerprinting, and the ongoing “extensible web” work.

24173,28130,3443862,"221973449","Biotech Connection is hosting a free event on Sept 15: ""Organs-on-chips: Revolutionizing the Drug Discovery Process"" The paradigm used by pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop new drugs is broken. Clinical studies take years to complete and testing a single compound can cost more than $2 million. Meanwhile, innumerable animal lives are lost, and the process often fails to predict human responses because traditional animal models do not accurately mimic human physiology. For these reasons, the pharmaceutical industry needs alternative ways to screen drug candidates in the laboratory. Microchips, called organs-on-chips, could one day form an accurate alternative to traditional animal testing.  How is emulating human systems on microchips changing the drug development process? Registration is FREE: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/organs-on-chips-revolutionizing-the-drug-discovery-process-registration-17283423184 Program: 6:00 PM - Registration Begins6:30 PM - Welcome and Opening Remarks6:45 PM - Panel Discussion and Q&amp;A7:45 PM - Networking Reception Speaker Bios: Donald E. Ingber, MD, PhDProfessor, Harvard Medical School &amp; Boston Children's Hospital Dr. Donald E. Ingber is the Founding Director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the John A. Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. His most recent innovation is a technology for building tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs, or ""Organs on Chips"", that mimic complicated human functions as a way to replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and establishment of human disease models. He was also the first to recognize that tensegrity architecture is a fundamental principle that governs how living cells are structured to respond biochemically to mechanical forces, and to demonstrate that integrin receptors mediate cellular mechanotransduction. Dr. Ingber has authored more than 375 publications and 85 patents, and has received numerous honors including the Holst Medal, Pritzker Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society, Rous-Whipple Award from the American Society for Investigative Pathology, Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of In Vitro Biology, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Innovator Award.

Everyone agrees reference data is the key to linking siloed data, but what links the reference data? With the complexity that defines customer party data in global banking, gaining extensive and comprehensive insights for KYC and AML has been nearly impossible. Until now. Semantics technology allows you to normalize data without extensive ETL. By letting you graph the hundreds of billions of associations between all your data — you can see risk (and opportunity) with greater clarity. It allows you to see data within the context of a department, the organization and the industry at large. Semantics can satisfy and simplify your regulatory and business needs. In this webinar, we will show you how leveraging the power of semantics inside a NoSQL database will provide a holistic view of customers, trades and transactions, a complete Customer 360. Join our MarkLogic Experts as they introduce semantics and explain how leading financial organizations are using semantics to better integrate their data, connect it, and search it at massive scale. In this webinar, you will learn: • Why Semantics is powerful • Key terminology and concepts • How to speed up data integration by 10x • How to reconcile disparate, siloed data sources — by using standard reporting formats/syntaxes • How banks are actually embedding standards such as BIAN and FIBO to solve real world industry problems and drive consistent adoption Time: 8am PT | 11am ET | 4pm BST | 5pm CEST To register, please visit: &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://bit.ly/1OZH1xu""&gt;http://bit.ly/1OZH1xu.","22 Sep 2015","11:00","Online Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Talk Details  David Alves, GQ Partners Pre-Production Performance Budgets based upon Production Metrics Organizations that care about Customer Experience enforce Pre-Production Performance Budgets.  Performance Budgets are metrics which limit such things as page size, load time, and any other factor that can impact the users experience.  The goal is to either maintain, or better yet, constantly improve your existing Production performance with every release.  In this short presentation, using New Relic Synthetics, our business partners at Global Quality Partners, LLC will show you how you can set and enforce Pre-Production Performance Budgets based upon Performance in Production, as part of your normal Continuous Delivery Lifecycle. 


Don Darwin, New Relic Put Synthetics to Work for You Learn to use New Relic Synthetics in your testing and production environments to ensure critical processes on your site are available 24x7. Want to use NR Synthetics to monitor your internal sites? Want to learn how to monitor specific assets of your site over a period of time? Come find out how!  


Ricardo DeMatos, Solutions Architect, Amazon Web Services Run Scalable Application Backends on AWS Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy, secure and monitor APIs at any scale. In this session, you’ll find out how you can quickly declare an API interface and connect it to any public HTTP endpoint, existing web service running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or code running on AWS Lambda. Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Join us for this introductory session to Amazon API Gateway. 


Tori Wieldt, Developer Advocate, New Relic From Pets to Cattle to Bacteria   We see a move of servers move from virtualization (cattle) to process separators (bacteria). What will the impact be to have servers that last only last as long a single process? At New Relic, we have customers monitoring Docker containers that last 5 minutes or less. How can organizations plan, develop and operate software in this environment? I’ll provide insights we gathered from our customers and from our own internal use of containers and short-lived servers.

Breakfast and Keynote Presentation:Predictive Analytics: Five Ways It Generates ValueSpeaker: Eric Siegel , founder, Predictive Analytics World The excitement over “big data” has grown dramatically. But what is the value, the function, the purpose? The most actionable win to be gained from data is prediction. This is achieved by analytically learning from data how to render predictions for each individual. Such predictions drive more effectively the millions of operational decisions that organizations make every day. In this keynote, Predictive Analytics World founder and Predictive Analytics author Eric Siegel reveals how predictive analytics works, and covers five ways in which it delivers value to organizations across industry sectors.

Fixing one problem can easily create many others. Without good tools to measure the impact of relevancy changes, there’s no way to know if the “fix” that you’ve developed will cause relevancy problems with other queries. Ideally, much like we have unit tests for code to detect when bugs are introduced, we would like to create ways to measure changes in relevancy. This is exactly what was done at OSC. They have developed a series of tools and practices that allow them to work with content experts to define metrics for search quality. Once defined, they can instantly measure the impact of modifying their relevancy strategy, allowing them to iterate quickly on very difficult relevancy problems. Doug Turnbull Is a Solr and Elasticsearch consultant for OpenSource Connections and the author of the book ""Relevant Search"". Doug lives and breathes smart, relevant search and focuses on moving his clients away from basic text matching to search with domain and business intelligence built in. He leverages search engine features such as Lucene internals and user signals to craft more relevant search results. Doug bridges the gap between content experts, search analytics, and technologists. To help bridge the gap, Doug created Quepid, a search relevancy collaboration canvas used extensively in OpenSource Connection's search work, and Splainer a Solr search results explanation tool and sandbox.","29 Sep 2015","18:00","8 New England Executive Park Burlington",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

25868,28394,6143312,"225518958","Momentum trading is one of the first things that many people think of when approaching quantitative finance. The idea is that investors will prefer to buy stocks that have been performing well, driving prices still higher, and will shy away from stocks with recent price drops, leading to less demand and further price decay. It is an intuitive way of modeling asset prices, and works in some cases.  In this lecture we will discuss how to determine if a momentum model is appropriate for a given case, and ways to use that model to execute trades. This talk is part of Quantopian’s Lecture Series. All lecture materials can be found at: www.quantopian.com/lectures. Pizza and beverages will be provided by Quantopian.

26102,32720,18334914,"224664818"," Charities are pretty great.  They help people who can't help themselves, and they impact the world (and we're all about that).  But other charities aren't so great...  Corruption and mismanagement of non-profits seems to be just as common as in for-profit companies. It's almost every week that you can find a news story about a charity falling under the social microscope because of some leaked documents exposing some kind of scandal. Using the shield of being a 'non-profit' has given rise to greater oversight and bureaucracy in otherwise noble organizations. There are charities out there that make incredibly positive impacts on the world. How can we build a better system that supports these groups and keeps the other (less noble) ones in check? This Think Tank will focus on using crowdsourcing, the Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies to create a solution for this challenge. At the end of the event, I'll present one project that we can work on together to help solve this problem. As with our previous event, upon request from existing Tankers, we'll be having more intimate events over the next several weeks. These will be focused on having in-depth discussions that get into technical details and lead to action steps for those who want to run with new ideas. We'll be capping the attendance limit since the venue is smaller, but if you have directly applicable skills, interest, or experience, email me directly and I'll send you an RSVP confirmation as long as we're not breaking any (major) fire codes.

Welcome to the first Africa Open Data Conference, which is being hosted by the Government of Tanzania and organized by The World Bank and IBM.  Open Data is a new public resource that is transforming communities and nations across the world.  It is driving innovation, investment, and job growth; revolutionizing transportation, health, education, and agriculture, civic engagement, IT innovation, and government transformation. • Cities are using Open Data to rationalize public transport, reducing costs and improving services.  • Nations are publishing raw weather and census data, providing business with access to new markets and just-in-time inventory forecasting based on weather patterns.  • Governments are leveraging Open Data to increase internal information sharing, improve supply chain efficiency, reduce regulatory burdens, and increase tax efficiency.  • Farms are taking advantage of Satellite Open Data to drive more agricultural yield, with less water, fertilizer, and pesticides, with precision agriculture.  • Banks, Insurers, and many other industries are using Open Data to find and validate business opportunities and risks, invest in infrastructure, and improve financial reporting.  • Communities are using cloud computing and low cost Open Data portals to collect information and develop new apps that solve local problems, communicate needs and issues, preserve languages and culture, improve education and social integration. Africa is ready for Open Data, African style - solving African problems with African innovations.  This conference is designed to bring together African governments, businesses, and communities with international aid organizations, foundations, and other interested parties to improve local, national, and regional investment, growth and economic development. The goal is to create Open Data awareness and demand across the continent by brainstorming new development opportunities in x-functional hands-on workshops and round-table discussions that result in funding proposals and pilots at the end of the conference.  We will have four pre-conference Open Data workshops/Jams/and Hackathons on Health, Education, Water, and Agriculture.  These same four subjects will continue as themes and tracks throughout the even as we explore Industry needs, capabilities, and international use cases for Open Data that drives economic growth and national prosperity. We are working with many partners: - The World Bank - IBM - Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition Program (GODAN) - International Development Resource Council - The Open Knowledge Foundation - The Open Data Institute - Code for Africa - The Open Government Partnership The dates are not 100% final but there is little time to spare.  We are looking for speakers and contributors, innovators and thought leaders, foundations and aid organizations, businesses and sponsors, from across Africa and around the world.  This is the first Africa Open Data Conference hosted in Africa, and we are grateful for the support, leadership, and vision of the President of Tanzania, the World Bank, and IBM.

You can encode these usual mechanisms, assuming they're causal and stationary, in a directed acyclic graph. The edges point from cause to effect. As usual with graphical models, you can use this structure to factorize the joint distribution. What else is it good for? Consider what happens if you want to intervene in the system, and fix the values of a subset of variables. You've disrupted the normal way things happen, and can't expect to just evaluate the conditional distribution (given the subset) to determine the outcome variables you're interested in. In short, P(Y|X) != P(Y|do(X)). The do(X) operation is the basic operation of do-calculus (a.k.a. the calculus of intervention). We need the graph in order to evaluate the do(X) operation. With this operation, we can calculate the effect of an intervention! At this meeting, we'll cover:(1) What is a causal DAG?(2) What is the do(X) operation, intuitively?(3) What are the rules of do-calculus? Then we'll work out an example! We'll be sure to demonstrate that P(Y|X) != P(Y|do(X)) in general. Can you find a case where equality holds? Recommended Pre-requisites: • Probability Theory (beginner): Know what a joint and conditional distribution is.  Know what marginalizing is. • Graphical Models (beginner): Know what a graphical model is.  Know how to factorize a joint distribution given a graph.  Know the term ""directed, acyclic graph"". Logistical Notes: • Be sure to be on time!  If you're more than 15 minutes late, you won't be able to get in.   • The receptionist may be not downstairs with the guest list promptly at 6:00.  If you arrive and the security desk is unaware of the meetup, just hang out until she arrives downstairs to check you in! • Be sure to bring ID for security! • There will be signs upstairs (""Math Meetup"") directing you to the room.","02 Sep 2015","18:30","200 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor New York",6,"will, event, well, new, network, get, come, nyc, workshop, drink"

Erlang alone, however, will not do any magic. It is merely an enabler that, thanks to its semantics, programming model and predictable virtual machine makes the end results easier to achieve. In this talk, Francesco will walk through the topology patterns of modern distributed Erlang architectures, discussing the tradeoffs in scalability and reliability the actor model, the failure model and the built-in distribution model encourage you to take. Bio: Francesco is the founder of Erlang Solutions Ltd (https://www.erlang-solutions.com/). He has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm, working on the first release of the OTP middleware, which he applied to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, allowing him to work in major Erlang-based projects both within and outside Ericsson. With what ever time he has over, he lectures graduate students at Oxford University and is the co-author of Erlang Programming (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do) and Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do), both published by O’Reilly.

Apache Drill started off with the audacious goal of delivering consistent, millisecond ANSI SQL query capability across wide range of data formats. At a high level, this translates to two key requirements – Schema Flexibility and Performance. Apache Drill provides the users the ability to interact with big data on Hadoop much faster and far more easily using the familiar SQL language. Users are no longer dependent on central IT teams and DBAs to produce schemas and then maintain them when the structure changes for a few records. Drill alleviates the pain associated with structuring unstructured data before one gains any insights by providing a simple mechanism to query any dataset on Hadoop - be it flat files, parquet or JSON files or tables within an HBase table. This session will give you an overview of several different use cases that enterprises are testing Drill for as well as the latest news on the project.

Any R user is consistently downloading additional packages on his computer and these packages often depend on other packages that also need to be downloaded as a consequence of the intended “root” packages. In his project, Xavier explored the CRAN R project website displaying all the R packages available and the R package download log files and proposed a methodology to extract the most popular R package based on the package dependencies. First, Xavier scrapped the CRAN website, using Spark and Python, for the 7,050+ webpages describing all the R packages in order to download the data related to package dependency and built a dependency matrix using the “sparse” matrix concept available within numpy in Python. Then, after downloading the 150 log files (2.5GB+) and using parallel computing, Xavier processed the 47 million line-items contained in the logs using the dependency matrix built previously in order to get only the records related to the “root” packages.Finally, the dependency between all the packages can be visualized using R network graphic packages; the most popular R packages are extracted from the “root” package data and are visualized using Python. Through collaboration with Fusion.net, our students delivered a super fan detection tool using shiny app. This project designs a program for charting the influencers and patterns of the Twitter community. The findings will be able to help online media companies identify their most important influencers on Twitter and understand their interests, patterns, and behaviors. Furthermore, recommendation systems can be built based on natural language processing ofinfluencers’ Twitter timeline to suggest content to attract their attention.Recommendation systems have been widely used by news media companies. Just like “Recommended for You” section of NYTimes.com, and “Recommendations” plugin on HuffPost Social News, personalizing the placement of articles on the apps and website has been used to guide news readers to find their most interested articles. The core of the recommendation systems is to recommend the right content to the right people at the right times. While a few recommendation algorithms (such as content-based method and collaborative filtering) are already in the market, this project serves as a basis to find out the influencers in social network, such as Twitter. As an extension, this project also uses AlchemyAPI as a natural language processing tool to extract entities and relevance scores from user timeline. This way, the system can understand the user’s interest from everything he/she has participated in the past. Based on the same idea of natural language processing from user timeline, a content-based recommendation system for influencers can be built in following steps:● Text mining on all superfans timeline content● Clustering texts on vectors from AlchemyAPI● Observe distributions of superfan scores and interests in different clusters● Content-based recommendation (match vectorized user timeline text and article text using cosine similarity) Reference links: Xavier's talk on Python and Spark, see all the files R, Python, Spark scripts, text files on github. 1. github:https://github.com/chabir/Most-Popular-R-packages2. slideshttps://github.com/chabir/Most-Popular-R-packages/blob/master/Most%20Popular%20R%20Packages%20meetup%2020150928.pdf","28 Sep 2015","18:30","205 East 42nd Street, 19th floor, New York, NY New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Drawing on ten years producing the Junk Charts blog (http://junkcharts.typepad.com), the premier source of online dataviz criticism, I have developed the Trifecta Checkup framework for appreciating data graphics. This framework also serves a guide for improving one’s charts, as good artists must develop a discriminating eye for the strengths and weaknesses of artwork.

Yet the idea of directly modeling stream processing in infrastructure systems is just coming into it's own after a few decades on the periphery. This talk will cover the basic challenges of reliable, distributed, stateful stream processing. It will cover how Apache Kafka was designed to support capturing and processing distributed data streams by building up the basic primitives needed for a stream processing system. Finally it will explore how these kind of infrastructure maps to practical problems based on our experience building and scaling Kafka to handle streams that captured hundreds of billions of records per day. 8:15 - Winner of the Strata Conference Ticket is announced, please make sure you register and attend the meetup to win.

With systems such as Impala and Spark, analysts can now run complex queries or jobs over large datasets within a matter of seconds. With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets. Despite these advances, some important gaps remain that prevent many applications from transitioning to Hadoop-based architectures. Users are often caught between a rock and a hard place: columnar formats such as Apache Parquet offer extremely fast scan rates for analytics, but little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access. Online systems such as HBase offer very fast random access, but scan rates that are too slow for large scale data warehousing workloads. This talk will investigate the trade-offs between real-time transactional access and fast analytic performance from the perspective of storage engine internals. It will also describe Kudu, the new addition to the open source Hadoop ecosystem that fills the gap described above, complementing HDFS and HBase to provide a new option to achieve fast scans and fast random access from a single API. Speaker:Todd Lipcon is a Software Engineer at Cloudera and a PMC member of the Apache Hadoop and Apache HBase projects. He holds a Sc.B in computer science from Brown University, where he completed an honors thesis developing a new collaborative filtering algorithm for the Netflix Prize Competition. Todd interned at Google, where he developed machine learning methods to detect credit card fraud on AdWords and Google Checkout.","29 Sep 2015","18:30","350 West Broadway New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Juliet will be talking about the Python API for Apache Spark, known as PySpark, and best practices for its use. Note: The RSVP list for this talk will close at 10:00am on the day of the event. Summary: PySpark (the component of Spark that allows users to write their code in Python) has grabbed the attention of Python programmers who analyze and process data for a living. The appeal is obvious: you don't need to learn a new language, and you still have access to modules (pandas, nltk, statsmodels, etc.) that you are familiar with, but you are able to run complex computations quickly and at scale using the power of Spark. In this talk, we will examine a real PySpark job that runs a statistical analysis of time series data to motivate the issues described above and provides a concrete example of best practices for real world PySpark applications. We will cover: • Python package management on a cluster using virtualenv. • Testing PySpark applications. • Spark's computational model and its relationship to how you structure your code. Bio: Juliet is a Data Scientist at Cloudera, and contributor/committer/maintainer for the Sparkling Pandas project. Her commercial applications of data science include developing predictive maintenance models for oil &amp; gas pipelines at Deep Signal, and designing/building a platform for real-time model application, data storage, and model building at WibiData.

Abstract Building machine learning models is all well and good, but how do they get productionized into a service? It's a long way from a Python script on a laptop, to a fault-tolerant system that learns continuously, serves thousands of queries per second, and scales to terabytes. The confederation of open source technologies we know as Hadoop now offers data scientists the raw materials from which to assemble an answer: the means to build models but also ingest data and serve queries, at scale. This short talk will introduce Oryx 2, a blueprint for building this type of service on Hadoop technologies. It will survey the problem and the standard technologies and ideas that Oryx 2 combines: Apache Spark, Kafka, HDFS, the lambda architecture, PMML, REST APIs. The talk will touch on a key use case for this architecture -- recommendation engines. Bio Sean Owen is director of data science at Cloudera in London. Before Cloudera, he founded Myrrix Ltd.

Skilled practitioners translate data, sometimes called the “second language of business,” into everyone’s first language, stories. &lt;/a&gt; But as old as storytelling is, storytelling with data is new. The methods are still developing, and there’s still no standard definition of “data story.” Many practitioners, for example, see storytelling with data as a complement to visualization while others, such as our keynote presenter and workshop facilitator, Ted Cuzzillo, understand that visualization is purely optional. In fact, data stories may be told in any medium, or combination of media. Crafting a good data story may seem easy, but it’s actually challenging. In this interactive workshop setting, you’ll work with a team and gain experience finding a story in data and shaping it for an audience. YOU WILL LEARN: ·  To find the story in a collection of data and shape it for the intended audience ·  To craft a story that combines data visuals, verbal narrative, or whatever media are accessible and appropriate ·  To choose the best media for your story and avoid noise ·  To understand and connect with the audience when telling a data story. PRE-REQUISITES: ·  This program is directed toward anyone interested in learning to effectively communicate information using data storytelling techniques. ·  A laptop computer is recommended, but not required, for this workshop.  You’ll be provided with collections of data visualizations for story crafting – both in print and digital form. Those who work with the digital versions will get greatest value from the workshop. ·  This session is intended to be interactive. The presenter will encourage discussion throughout the presentation. REGISTRATION: Join us, and your NYC Tri-State TDWI community, on September 30th. The Seminar is open to all business and IT professionals.  There is no fee to attend our program, although pre-registration is required.  Visit the NYC Tri-State Area Chapter page to register, and find additional details. SPEAKER BIOGRAPHIES Ted Cuzzillo is a journalist and industry analyst. For more than 25 years in several tech-centered industries, he has advocated the use of stories—not just the usual “how” and “what” but also the “why” and the “who.” In the business intelligence industry, he has written since 2007 for TDWI (BI This Week), Information Management, and his weblog, Datadoodle.

For storage, we use a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data. An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events.

Recently, Chris forked the project for NYC to create gothamzoning.org.  At this hacknight, he'll explain the process of forking and modifying the app, what tools and technologies were used, and how he was able to stand up a fully-featured zoning app in just a few days of part-time coding. ==== What is a civic hacknight? This is a weekly project night is for technologists, designers, developers, data scientists, map makers, and activists who are working on ""civic technology"" projects. Consider this to be a study hall or office hours to improve you and the city. This night is for those who want to:   * work on projects * start a new project, or find one to join * get feedback from experts  * learn about tools for local empowerment, open data, and open government Bring your laptop, power supply, ideas, projects, maps, data, and questions.

Event schedule: 6:30-7:00  Visualization of Trading Strategy backtesting  7:00-7:15    Q&amp;A 7:15-7:45  Fastest subway in NYC (Data updates every 10seconds!) 7:45-8:00   Q&amp;A Speaker bio:  Luke Lin is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at Stony Brook University who is specialized in partial differential equations. As a lifelong learner of mathematics, he is extremely efficient in quantitative analysis and also skilled at communicating abstract concepts. With proficiency in R and Python, Luke is primed to be a major asset to any analytic force. Xavier Capdepon (MSc Urban Engineering &amp; Master in Corporate Finance)Xavier has more than 12 years experience in analytical modeling. In a career ranging from transportation research to insurance securitization trading and esoteric securities banking, Xavier has deep roots in Data Science. From C and VBA, to SQL, R and Python, Xavier believes in knowing the best-in-breed toolkits. An experienced instructor and consultant in the field of finance, Xavier continues to deepen his abiding interest in prediction through taking the ASA/CAS actuarial exams (first two completed) and experimenting with machine learning models using Hadoop and Spark. Previously at Guggenheim Partners, he is currently a Fellow at the NYC Data Science Academy.  Agenda/Content:  Demonstration of a Shiny App for building strategy from technical indicators and visualizing the return. In this Shiny App, Luke implemented a trading strategy generated by Bollinger Band, visualized the return and eventually modified the strategy by MACD. Bollinger Band is an elementary volatility indicator and the strategy is generated based on the belief that the price bounce back whenever it hits the edge of Bollinger Band. This is an one of the simplest strategies and personally I believe it reflects humans' most naive feeling about the stock prices. The visualization builds up the connection between the market data and our strategy, because we can actually see how market react to it. Once the return can be seen, it is straightforward to understand why a strategy fail in certain period. In our case, we see that strategy fails when the trend price is very strong--which makes sense because when trend is strong the assumption that the price bounce back is no longer valid. Here we need to impose another popular indicator, MACD. MACD reveals momentum of the price change. The backend algorithm basically suspends buying signal from Bollinger Band and encourages selling to stop loss when MACD shows very negative momentum. It does the opposite when MACD indicates positive momentum. This simple modification reduce the risk or improve the return in several different stocks.The importance of his method lies in the fact that concept behind the modification is simple and the math I used is basic yet the improvement is obvious. This suggests to a reasonable extent our trading result can be improved with better tool and understanding. Demonstration of a Shiny App for processing subways traveling time calculations and visualizing the subways movements in real time using a Python script.In his Shiny app, Xavier explored the MTA data by redrawing a map of New York using the paths of both buses and subways, implemented a script to compare and visualize the travel times of the lines 4 Express train and 1 local train from the bronx to lower manhattan and to create a real time map of the 1 train.The idea for the app is based on a comment from his sister in law who mentionned several times that, in her experience, the subways, 1 local trains and 4 express trains, were not running with the same punctuality from the Bronx to Lower Manhattan during the early morning peak. In order to investigate, Xavier used the static and real time data available on the MTA.info website.At first, in an attempt to make sense of the numerous files and data available, he used the data to redraw the map of new york city using the paths used every day by the buses and the subways. The visualization is a map with a particularity: the transparency of the drawing package ggplot2 allows to highlight the streets used by several bus lines around new york city.Then, Xavier wrote a script to gather the data and calculate the travel time for the 1 and 4 trains from the Bronx to lower Manhattan given a depart time along the day. The visualization some trends over the day with two peaks at rush hours and lower difference in travel time between the 1 and 4 trains than expected.Finally, using the work described previously, the Shiny app also presents a real time map of the 1 train using real time data gathered every 10 second from the MTA API using Python script.

The room number is 44-02.  Event agenda:  6:30 - 7:00 PM: Networking &amp; Food 7:00 - 8:30 PM: Talk by Joel Tetreault8:30 - 9:00 PM: Socializing Applying Natural Language Processing to Automated Grammatical Error Correction for Language Learning A fast growing area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the use of automated tools for identifying and correcting grammatical errors made by language learners. This growth, in part, has been fueled by the needs of a large number of people in the world who are learning and using a second or foreign language. For example, it is estimated that there are currently over one billion people who are non-native speakers of English. These numbers drive the demand for accurate tools that can help learners to write and speak proficiently in another language. Such demand also makes this an exciting time for those in the NLP community who are developing automated methods for grammatical error correction (GEC). While there have been many exciting developments in GEC over the last few years, there is still considerable room for improvement as state-of-the-art performance in detecting and correcting several important error types is still inadequate for many real world applications.  In this talk, I will provide an overview of the field of automated grammatical error correction, including its history, leading methodologies and its particular set of challenges.  Although applications of GEC are often geared toward the classroom, its methods are more generally applicable to a wide variety of NLP problems, especially where systems must contend with noisy data, such as MT evaluation and correction, analysis of microblogs and other user-generated content, and disfluency detection in speech. If time permits, we'll play with a simple grammatical error codebase (using Python and the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning toolkit) to predict the correct preposition in an English sentence. Speaker bio: Joel Tetreault is a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs in New York City.  His research focus is Natural Language Processing with specific interests in anaphora, dialogue and discourse processing, machine learning, and applying these techniques to the analysis of English language learning and automated essay scoring.  Previously he was Principal Manager of the Core Natural Language group at Nuance Communications, Inc. where he worked on the research and development of NLP tools and components for the next generation of intelligent dialogue systems.  Prior to Nuance, he worked at Educational Testing Service for six years as a Managing Senior Research Scientist where he researched automated methods for detecting grammatical errors by non-native speakers, plagiarism detection, and content scoring.  Tetreault received his B.A. in Computer Science from Harvard University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Rochester.  He was also a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, where he worked on developing spoken dialogue tutoring systems.  In addition he has co-organized the Building Educational Application workshop series for 8 years, the CoNLL 2013 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction, and is currently NAACL Treasurer.","10 Sep 2015","18:30","1515 Broadway New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

But getting a grip on all of your automated tests — and then figuring out whether your software is good enough to go live — becomes harder and harder as you speed up the delivery of your software. We’ll share tips on how naming conventions, partitioning of testware and mirroring the application’s structure in the test code help you best handle automated testing for CD. We’ll also discuss some of the challenges that arise from having more and more tests to make sense of, and will examine some approaches for trend analysis, result aggregation and test optimization across the multiple test tools you likely have in use. These practices will help you draw the right conclusions from your tests and deliver code faster, with the confidence that your systems won’t fail in production. -------------------------------------------------- BIO &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/xebialabs""&gt;Andrew Phillips works for XebiaLabs, building tools to support problems around continuous delivery and DevOps at scale.

Over two decades later Google reports 35-thousand results for ""slab allocator"". CiteSeerX reports 93 citations. And many modern kernel allocators are based on his design, such as illumos, Linux, and FreeBSD. Jeff's design, along with the original paper, remains just as relevant today as it was 21 years ago. Join me as I tell the tale of the Slab Allocator: where it came from, what it is, why it's important, and where it's going.

With the introduction of wearable technology, the sources of that data have rapidly increased, and will only continue to do so. With all of this data comes an epic opportunity to use AI and computer algorithms to spot trends in massive data sets and USE those trends to tell you more about yourself. Tracy Ingram Tracy is an entrepreneur and fellow Think Tank leader in Tampa, Florida, and he has experience directly related to this arena. He runs BioscanR, a personal health monitoring service that uses wearable devices to track - and even forecast - your health. Tracy and his team were part of the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE and are now focusing on the path of custom predictive algorithms for early detection. Imagine getting a notification that tells you that you're about to have a heart attack - and which can even call 911 automatically if it's happening. This is the kind of stuff Tracy and his team are working on. Tracy will be joining us for this Think Tank to talk about his work and the healthcare tech world at large. Don't miss this one!

31950,40538,11194812,"225203030","This next meetup will be presented by Amit Sharma (@amt_shrma ), and will be focusing on causality in practice!  Here's his write-up for the talk: Here, there, causality is everywhere! Graphical models present a useful abstraction of causal pathways, but there are numerous causal pathways in the real world. It is often not clear whether a causal graph correctly models a given scenario, or when it does, whether we have enough data to estimate causal effects. In such a messy scenario, it would not be a bad decision to abandon the search for causality altogether, if not for the far-reaching, important effects of causality in almost all branches of scientific inquiry.  Here are some examples:  • Economic Policy: How much does the school you go to affect your future earnings? How bad is military transcription for future earnings or wellbeing of an individual?   • Political science: How do televised ads from presidential candidates affect voter turnouts? Does mandating quotas for women in local government lead to changes in policy? • Human behavior: Does public recognition of scholastic ability lead to better performance? If you friend smokes, would you smoke too?  • Biology and medicine: Does Vitamin-D deficiency increase chances of colorectal cancer? Are heart attack surgeries beneficial for future health of patients?  • Web applications: How much does the Facebook newsfeed influence the information we are exposed to? How much do recommendation systems shape our purchasing decisions?  In this talk, we will select a bunch of these as motivating examples and discuss the four main methodologies for estimating causal effects. All through, our goal will be make connections to bayesian networks/graphical models and show how they can serve as a unifying framework for dealing with causality.  Outline: • Controlled randomized experiments  •  Conditioning on observable confounders (back door criterion)  •  Stratification •  Matching  •  Regression(?)  •  Mechanism-based strategies (Front door criterion)  •  Natural experiments •  As-if experiments •  Instrumental variables •  Regression discontinuities Recommended Pre-requisites: • Probability Theory (intermediate): Know what a joint and conditional distribution is.  Know what marginalizing is. • Graphical Models (intermediate): Know what a graphical model is.  Know how to factorize a joint distribution given a graph.  Know the term ""directed, acyclic graph"". Understand the causal interpretation of a DAG. (check out the references from the last meetup!) Logistical Notes: • Be sure to be on time!  If you're more than 15 minutes late, you won't be able to get in.   • The receptionist may be not downstairs with the guest list promptly at 6:00.  If you arrive and the security desk is unaware of the meetup, just hang out until she arrives downstairs to check you in! • Be sure to bring ID for security!  • There will be signs upstairs (""Math Meetup"") directing you to the room.

31969,39747,8271612,"225115274","TOPIC:  Data Literacy Beyond the 3 V's ***PLEASE NOTE: We are trying a unique forum this time as our guest speaker will be presenting remotely to our live meeting at StackExchange. We believe this will facilitate an even broader array of top thought-leaders globally while still fostering our Skeptics community. This event will be recorded. Your feedback is much appreciated. Steven Mornelli. *** Dr. Kirk Borne will address one of the fundamental building blocks of data science know-how and analytics capability that is often over-looked. That core competency is data and statistical literacy. There is so much focus on the abundant uses of data resources, analytics tools, and data science algorithms that we often overlook some of the unavoidable abuses and misuses that creep in.  A related problem that we frequently encounter is the lack of scientific literacy -- i.e., the lack of understanding that science is a process and methodology, based on hypothesis, experimentation, and testing -- science is not simply a collection of facts.  Concepts that contribute to data and statistical literacies will be discussed. These may include: proper use versus the abuse and misuse of statistics, maps, and graphs; fallacious reasoning; deduction versus inference from data; bias versus objectivity in the interpretation of data. Additional data literacies include understanding of concepts like these: data types, modeling approaches (supervised versus unsupervised), training versus testing datasets, model accuracy versus precision,overfitting versus underfitting, and descriptive versus predictive analytics.  As data scientists, we may take an understanding of such basic concepts as a given, and consequently assume that our corporate executives, clients, or data science initiates will grasp our jargon and appreciate the wonders of the support vector machine, or the random forest, or local linear embedding. The requisite data and statistical literacies could exist in some cases, but it is not a safe starting assumption when consulting, advising, training, and communicating data analytics benefits and results to a broader audience.  Various data and statistical literacies will be illustrated through examples, including some classic cases and some real-life failures in the media. In order to communicate effectively the value and validity of our data analytics processes and results, let us keep in mind that we must first contribute to the data literacy of our audiences.

Charlie O'Donnell, Sole Partner &amp; Founder, Brooklyn Bridge Ventures Charlie O'Donnell is the sole Partner and Founder at Brooklyn Bridge Ventures and loves it that way. The fund makes seed investments and the first venture firm located in Brooklyn--where he was born and raised. The longest he has been outside of the five boroughs of New York City is three weeks. Charlie has a reputation for being early to identifying important companies. Nick Bilton identifies him as an influence on early Twitter investors in his book, Hatching Twitter. Dennis Crowley credits him as having helped kick off the first funding of Foursquare before other VCs had said yes. At First Round Capital, he sourced the firm's investments in Singleplatform (sold to Constant Contact) and GroupMe (sold to Skype). Charlie discovered GroupMe at the hackathon where the service had been built.

32322,36510,1516886,"225265016","Abstract: Vector models are being used in a lot of different fields: natural language processing, recommender systems, computer vision, and other things. They are fast and convenient and are often state of the art in terms of accuracy. One of the challenges with vector models is that as the number of dimensions increase, finding similar items gets challenging. Erik developed a library called ""Annoy"" that uses a forest of random tree to do fast approximate nearest neighbor queries in high dimensional spaces. We will cover some specific applications of vector models with and how Annoy works.

32539,32051,1406240,"224749681","For the first time ever we will meet on a Friday so as many people as possible can attend Hadley's talk! A big thank you to Twitter for hosting us this month and for providing pizza and beer. About the talk: A fluent interface lets you easily express yourself in code. Over time a fluent interface retreats to your subconscious. You don't need to bring it to mind; the code just flows out of your fingers. I strive for this fluency in all the packages I write, and while I don't always succeed, I think I've learned some valuable lessons along the way. In this talk, I'll discuss three guidelines that make it easier to develop fluent interfaces: • Pure functions. A pure function only interacts with the world through its inputs and outputs; it has no side-effects. Pure functions make great building blocks because they're are easy to reason about and can be easily composed. • Predictable interfaces. It's easier to learn a function if it's consistent, because you can learn the behaviour of a whole group of functions at once. I'll highlight the benefits of predictability with some of my favourite R ""WAT""s (including `c()`, `sapply()` and `sample()`). • Pipes. Pure predictable functions are nice in isolation but are most powerful in combination. The pipe, `%&gt;%`, is particularly in important when combining many functions because it turns function composition on its head so you can read it from left-to-right. I'll show you how this has helped me build dplyr, rvest, ggvis, lowliner, stringr and more. This talk will help you make best use of my recent packages, and teach you how to apply the same principles to make your own code easier to use. About Hadley: Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio and a member of the R Foundation. He builds tools (computational and cognitive) to support data science. His work includes R packages for data analysis (ggvis, dplyr, tidyr), data ingest (readr, readxl, haven), and principled software development (roxygen2, testthat, devtools). He is also a writer, educator, and frequent speaker promoting more accessible, more effective and more fun data analysis. Notes about this meetup: Doors open with pizza and beer 6, announcements and Hadley's talk begin at 7 and then we'll go to a local bar after.

Tori Wieldt, Developer Advocate, New Relic From Pets to Cattle to Bacteria  We see a move of servers move from virtualization (cattle) to process separators (bacteria). What will the impact be to have servers that last only last as long a single process? At New Relic, we have customers monitoring Docker containers that last 5 minutes or less. How can organizations plan, develop and operate software in this environment? I’ll provide insights we gathered from our customers and from our own internal use of containers and short-lived servers.

Personalization of products, services, even functionality of everyday devices is the next frontier in UI development. The ability to quickly and secure verify an identity of a user is a key in the process. Making user authentication a friendly, or even better, a frictionless process to a user, is key to adaptation. Traditional passwords are on the way out. Biometrics will become the next identification standard. In this presentation President of Speechpro Alexey Khitrov will make a case for voice and multi-modal verification on mobile platforms and voice-based UI's. Speechpro pioneered this approach with its deployment at Wells Fargo where voice+face biometrics replaced traditional passwords and PINs in the bank's mobile app. Mr Khitrov will share insights from this deployments and present new ideas and biometric capabilities for user authentication.  Alexey Khitrov is a President of SpeechPro, a global leader in voice biometrics. He joined the company in 2007 as Director of Strategic Development and helped SpeechPro to actively grow in the biometric space. Mr. Khitrov is an active member of the biometric community and as a thought leader, is frequently invited to address industry trade shows and conferences. Prior to joining SpeechPro, Alexey spent over 3 years at BMO Capital Markets working with a variety of financial products. He holds an MBA degree from Schulich School of Business (York University, Toronto, Canada). Before his MBA studies, he gained over 5 years of experience with a number of leading financial institutions.  8:00PM - 8:30PM - Hang Out - Network Share this event:  http://bit.ly/NUICen_NY29 @nuicen Join NUI Central.com IMPORTANT : If you come to the event and you are not registered on the Meetup site by 3:00PM on the day of the Meetup, you will have to wait to the side to see if there's room to accommodate you.

A key part of planning involves selecting articles, photographs, and other resources and storing these in the user's Favorites. Recently we migrated major parts of our technology stack to open source technologies. As part of our migration strategy, we zeroed in on MongoDB, since it better suited our requirements for speed and data structure as well as eliminating the need for a caching layer. The transition required a period in which both our legacy and new API where working concurrently with data being persisted on both databases (SQL and Mongo) and all records were being synched with every request. We resourced to many strategies and applications to achieve this goal, including: Pentaho, AWS SQS and SNS, a queue messenger system and some proprietary ruby gems. In this session we will review our strategy and some of the lessons we learned about successfully migrating with zero downtime.

You will hear about how choosing the Solr approach saved us a ton of custom development, and enabled us to offer end-users features such as personalization, faceted search and navigation of various types of content (e.g., people, events, alumni stories), autocomplete, and a geolocation mapping UI for navigating the people directory. In addition to a demo of the end-user UI, the talk will outline technical implementation details—these will include how we modeled the content in the database to work with Solr, developed a “search wrapper” to handle access control by brokering the requests/responses between the UI layer and Solr, and developed a custom Java loader to import content from our RDBMS into Solr. In short, this talk will describe the path we took in adopting Solr, speed bumps and potholes we hit along the way, where we are currently, and what the future roadmap looks like for using Solr in the HBS Enterprise.  Bio:  Ravi Mynampaty is just another search guy.

34367,32720,18334914,"224664854","NEW DATE SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY - We'll return to Tuesdays after this exception.  As I'm sure you know, drones are pretty much everywhere now. They're being used in almost every industry for uses spanning agricultural data collection, ambulatory services, and package delivery (and the list, of course, goes on). Here's the thing though... What happens when there are too many drones in the sky? And they start hitting each other? And falling on our heads? Not a pretty thought. Which is why big names (and I mean BIG. Google. NASA. Amazon.) have been meeting to develop a tracking and collision-detection system for drones, whether commercial or recreational.  The Goal For This Think Tank The end goal of this think tank is two-fold:  First, we should be up to date on the current legislation so we can have an informed discussion. When we leave, we should be up to speed on what's happening in the industry so our discussions and any followup groups can hit the ground running. I recommend starting with this quick article: https://www.rt.com/usa/310705-drone-air-traffic-control/ Second, let's talk about tipping the current timeline on its head. NASA's ""short term"" goal is to have this system ready within the next five years. Five. Years. Five. FIVE YEARS?!! And even then, they say it will still be ten to fifteen years until it would actually allow for scaled use of the program. That's ridiculous.  So let's talk about versions of a system that could utilize crowdsourced information, AI, and other technology to make this happen within 2 years. That's our line in the sand. Let's do it!! See you there! -Dan Special thanks to Breather for an awesome meeting room!

RSVP NOW at http://www.NYCSQL.com/events/225122166/ A Database Month event: http://www.DatabaseMonth.com/database/sql-acid Robbie Mihalyi, Vice President of Engineering, Clustrix In this session, we will discuss various SQL scale-up/out strategies along with their trade offs. We will explore how to set up SQL RDBMS architecture that scales out and is both elastic and consistent, while simultaneously delivering fault tolerance and ACID compliance. We will also cover how data gets distributed in this architecture, how the query processor works, how rebalancing happens and other architectural elements. Examples cited will include cloud deployments and e-commerce use-cases. The key take-aways are: • Five RDBMS scaling strategies along with their trade offs • The importance of having no single point of failure for OLTP (fault tolerance) • The vagaries of the cloud and how it impacts using an RDBMS in the cloud Robbie Mihalyi, Vice President of Engineering, Clustrix Robbie leads the Clustrix development and QA teams; he has over 25 years of technology leadership and operational experience at startups and large organizations. He has led both database product development teams and SaaS application development teams. Prior to Clustrix, Robbie was the founder and CTO of Thynkster.

It's going to be the biggest ASL drone sports event on the East Coast and we want YOU in the games! Space is LIMITED, so pilots will be entered on a first come-first serve basis until the limit is reached. There is no cost to enter, and all registered pilots get two free tickets to Maker Faire, but only if you RSVP with us. Pilots click here to register: http://bit.ly/dSports Once registered, you will receive a pilot/maker package with all an event guide, rules and other information. You will also receive 2 free tickets to Maker faire, passes to private maker parties and events, a gift bag of special goodies from our sponsors, discounts and so much more. Complete Maker Faire info can be found Here: http://makerfaire.com/ =••••• PLEASE NOTE ••••••= RULES OF DRONE COMBAT Combat drones limited to 1kg max weight, 550mm size, 4S battery and absolutely NO carbon fiber props. We encourage creative offensive and defensive weapons, but NO use of fire, projectiles, chemical or electro-based systems. We reserve the right to refuse or demand modification to any drone deemed a potential hazard. Standard drone combat consists of two drones fighting head to head in a pre-defined arena. The objective is to knock the opponent’s drone to the floor while avoiding your own drone hitting the floor. Combat starts with each drone ready-to-fly and idling in a designated landing zone or ring. At the sound of the buzzer, each drone lifts into the air. Each player begins with 3 points. One point is deducted each time a player’s drone touches the floor. The first player to reach 0 points is declared the loser. Only drone-on-drone physical contact is permitted. Players may use flying, hitting and bashing to attempt to force the other drone into the ground. Drones may not use fire, projectiles, electric shocks/signals or chemicals/materials to interfere with the other drone. If combat results in both drones hitting the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other, then both players loses a point. However, a game-winning point or “kill” point can NOT be obtained if both drones hit the floor at the same time or within 3 seconds of each other (ie. The winning drone must NOT hit the floor with 3 seconds of the losing drone hitting the floor for final kill point). Each time a drone crashes, Pilots have 90 seconds to lift off again. During this time they are permitted to enter the arena to make emergency repairs, replace batteries &amp; parts or make adjustments to their drone. Pilots have 90 seconds to get their drone flying or they are eliminated from the match. During this time the healthy drone is allowed to land and rest, but it must land upright and completely within it’s starting zone or ring. If for any reason the drone hits the floor outside of the ring upon landing or otherwise crashes or can’t lift-off again, it will lose a point as if it had crashed in combat. Matches end at 5 minutes. The drone with the highest score will be declared the winner. If there is a tie, the winner will be determined by tennis ball firing squad. Pilots click here to register: http://bit.ly/dSports PLEASE NOTE=••••• FPV Racing INFO: ••••••= Important FPV Guidelines:For FPV racing, or any FPV event where multiple people are flying at the same time, it is best to keep the video transmitter frequencies separated as much as possible to allow as many flyers in the air at one time as possible. If you have a 5.8ghz setup, please be prepared to change your video transmitter to one of the following frequencies. Keep in mind that most transmitters default to channel 1, so it’s best to pick another one so there are fewer conflicts. Preferred 5.8ghz band FPV Frequencies:Boscam/Fatshark = the manufacture and name for the more common frequency bands.1st Number = the channel within that bandNumber in parentheses = the boscam channel number on a 32 channel VTX/VRXLast Number = the actual frequency for that channel Boscam 4 (34) 5645ghzBoscam 1 (31) 5707ghz **Fatshark 1 (41) 5740ghz **Fatshark 4 (44) 5800ghzFatshark 7 (47) 5860ghzBoscam 8 (38) 5945ghz ** Only one person at a time can use these frequencies as they overlap We will have frequency tags and a whiteboard to help manage who can fly when. Please be considerate and do not power up your VTX if someone else is using that channel. Always check if that channel is being used and call out when you are about to power up so others can speak up if it is not a good time to do so. Even if you are on another channel, the power surge from turning on a transmitter is enough to disrupt someone else’s video for a few seconds, which is all it takes to lose position and crash. PILOT FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT(redundancy is safety!)Since most pilots are using the Vtx (5.8ghz video transmitter) bands, please be aware of your transmitter type (Fatshark/Immersion or Boscam) and channel. Here's the basics: 1) Never power up your video TRANSMITTER without first checking that there is no one else currently transmitting on the same channel. 2) Power up your video RECEIVER and goggles/display first BEFORE you power up your aircraft and video transmitter. If you see someone else's signal, then you need to switch your channel, you're stomping. 3) During races, only those in the race should be transmitting video (unless you check in with the race coordinator first to add your frequency to the list.) 4) For racing, the best spread of channels currently seems to be Fatshark/Immersion channels 1, 4 and 7, and Boscam channels 1, 4 and 8. Everyone should initially set their transmitters to one of those channels. 5) Please arrange the video transmitter on your aircraft so that the dip switches/button to change your channels are easily accessible. You may need to change channels quickly just before your scheduled heat. -------------------------------------------- Suggested equipment to bring: 1) Your aircraft(s) and ground station. Be prepared to let everyone know the frequencies you'll be using for your Tx, Vtx, etc. You may want bring your rig in a mobile chest of some kind with wheels, it is a small enjoyable hike each way. 3) AMA License: (highly recommended if you are flying, you can get it here: http://www.modelaircraft.org/) 4) Safety glasses or high impact sunglasses. 5) Sunscreen and water. 6) BYOP - Bring Your Own Power generator, Batteries and charging station. There are no power outlets at this location. 7) A fold out chair to sit comfortably while in FPV. GENERAL INFO: NO FLY ZONE: For safety, the no fly zone is anywhere outside the race track and infield. Please launch your aircraft at the edge or in the grass/dirt area. When coming in for a landing, please approach slowly and don't prop wash/buzz everyone, there's lots of pilots ""blind"" with FPV goggles that can't tell if you are out of control. We have a 100% safety record and intend to keep it that way. FLY ZONE: All pilots and spectators should stay out of the fly zone as much as possible. Please pilot your aircraft from within the no-fly zone. If you crash or need to enter the field, please wait until races are over, and call out in the pit area your intensions so other pilots can avoid you. CRASH &amp; TRASH: Take out what you brought in, including a little extra while you're at it. That way we're always spotless. KIDS: we encourage bringing any family members and kids interested in RC flying, as it's a great place for young pilots to learn best practices in the art of FPV. For ground/flight safety purposes, we ask that all young pilots be always supervised and mentored on safe flying practices, kept away from dangerous fly zones, and be courteous/don't touch without asking in all staging areas. It is highly recommended for kids to wear protective eyewear. RESPONSIBLE FLYING: Our group prides itself on minimal rules and attracts folks that are mindful, safety conscious and considerate of other pilots, bystanders, pets, wildlife and the environment. If in doubt please ask about best practices from any of the experienced pilots, we're all here to help learn and have a really great time together. RACING: Please race at a speed and agility that you can comfortably maintain control of your rig. When flying, please be aware of other pilots calling out in the pit. Typically these are ""Person on the course, dog on the course chasing rig, powering up on Vtx, etc."" It is critical you do not fly over people in the pit or other visitors in the park. And most important, have a blast of fun! Pilots click here to register: http://bit.ly/dSports Rotors Up!

Do not park in spots marked handicap, no parking, or for specific companies. The X marks the spot of the meetup. We are directly behind the Natty Boh tower on the campus (the building with the big white roof).   Talks Data Science: A Climate Modeler’s Perspective Climate Change is arguably the most important global issue of our times. Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research. Speaker Pavan Racherla has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on “The Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.” He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]).

Speaker Bio Aldrin is a developer for Hortonworks where he works on Apache NiFi as part of Hortonworks Data Flow (HDF).  Aldrin likes automation, Docker, and championing do-while loops.  You can find him on Twitter, @aldrinpiri. ---------- 7:00 PM  Building Data Pipelines for Solr with Apache NiFi Presented by Bryan Bende - Hortonworks Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. It supports highly configurable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of NiFi's key features include a web-based user interface for monitoring and controlling data flows, guaranteed delivery, data provenance, and easy extensibility through custom processor development.  These features make NiFi a perfect candidate for building production quality data pipelines that interact with Apache Solr. This talk will demonstrate how to use a NiFi processor that delivers data to a Solr update handler, as well as a processor for extracting data from Solr on regular intervals for delivery to down-stream systems. In addition we will show how these processors can be combined with other built-in NiFi processors to solve a variety of use cases, including log aggregation, and indexing messages received from Kafka. -- Speaker Bio Bryan Bende is a Software Engineer at Hortonworks where he develops dataflow capabilities around the core framework of Apache NiFi. He has over ten years of experience developing enterprise software solutions with Java and supporting technologies.

Object-based storage (OBS) has emerged over the past decade as a way to scale storage to meet the rising torrent of data being generated. The presenters from MonadCloud and Cloudian will provide a short history of data storage and focus on what object storage is, why it is important today, and what Cloudian is delivering to its customers through its partners. 

•  Cloudian has developed a 100% AWS S3 API-compatible object-based storage software that can be installed on clusters of industry standard x86 storage servers. The presenters will explain why Cloudian focused on full AWS S3-compatibility, and how it incorporates prominent open source software projects, like Cassandra, Redis and Puppet into their object-based storage software. The use cases for object-based storage will be covered and how Cloudian approaches the market for object-based storage. The presenters will close-out their presentation by explaining how Cloudian has gone beyond the “cheap and deep” nature of object storage and moved into using its storage clusters to create “smart data” and storage that remains “forever live” on its clusters.

The initial modulestore stored each module as a document and supported two branches per course - a draft and published branch. The newest implementation supports multiple branches, keeps all past course revisions, and has a different schema designed with our typical query patterns in mind.

Please join us on Tuesday, the 27th of October, for some great talks, networking and refreshments.  We expect to have two separate presentations, along with ample time for questions and discussion.  This post will be updated with details on the second speaker and on the specifics of the refreshments shortly. First Presentation: ""Building a Reseller Channel for Cloud Services,"" by Jeff Schmitt The number of Cloud Services Providers and Cloud based offerings are exploding in the marketplace. Getting these innovative cloud offerings in front of the right customers can be a challenge, thus many firms are looking to the traditional IT VAR channel as a route to market. In this presentation Jeff Schmitt will discuss what to look for in a VAR (Solution Provider) Investments a solution provider needs to make, and review some personal successes and failures bring cloud services to mark via the channel. About Jeff:   Jeff has been working with Solutions Providers for the past 15 years, first at EMC corporation where he ran the channel services organization, and most recently, at CenturyCloud, where he was responsible for channel strategy and partner enablement. 



Second Presentation: ""The Economics of Buying and Selling Cloud Services Through the Channel,"" by Brian Singer Companies are spending more than ever on cloud services, with AWS recently eclipsing $2 billion in quarterly sales. Against this backdrop, channel providers face difficult choices, with shrinking resale margins and customers that demand responsiveness. In this talk, Brian Singer will draw on his experience at Orbitera working with dozens of channel organizations to provide a clear understanding of how to build margin in a cloud-focused business, how cloud impacts the economics of the channel, and what to look for when working with a cloud managed services or channel provider. Brian Singer is the Co-Founder of Orbitera, a cloud commerce startup. Prior to Orbitera, Brian had key roles in Business Development and Product Marketing at BMC and Novell. Brian earned his MBA from the MIT Sloan School and holds a degree in Computer Engineering from Brown University.

You will hear about how choosing the Solr approach saved us a ton of custom development, and enabled us to offer end-users features such as personalization, faceted search and navigation of various types of content (e.g., people, events, alumni stories), autocomplete, and a geolocation mapping UI for navigating the people directory. In addition to a demo of the end-user UI, the talk will outline technical implementation details—these will include how we modeled the content in the database to work with Solr, developed a “search wrapper” to handle access control by brokering the requests/responses between the UI layer and Solr, and developed a custom Java loader to import content from our RDBMS into Solr. In short, this talk will describe the path we took in adopting Solr, speed bumps and potholes we hit along the way, where we are currently, and what the future roadmap looks like for using Solr in the HBS Enterprise.  Talk 2: ""Stump The Chump""  Chris ""Hoss"" Hostetter was the first ever Solr user at CNET Networks in 2005, helping to define what Solr was and what it eventually became at the Apache Software Foundation. At the first ever ""Lucene Revolution"" in Boston, Hoss was the first ever ""Chump"" at the first ever ""Stump The Chump!"" session. 5 years and 8 hot seats later, Hoss is returning to Boston and will look back at some of the most interesting Solr questions he's ever been asked. Time permitting, there will be also be a Q&amp;A giving everyone a chance to ""Stump The Chump!"" Speaker Bios:  Ravi Mynampaty is just another search guy. He believes that making incremental changes is an effective path towards improving search and tries to make this happen on a daily basis. He is currently working on Enterprise Search at HBS, which includes setting Enterprise Search strategy, design and implementation of findability standards, search tools, and search user interfaces. Ravi has masters degree in engineering from the University of Massachusetts and Brandeis University. Katia Muser currently works as Technical Solution Architect at HBS.  She is a seasoned IT professional and has designed effective software solutions in various verticals such as higher-ed, insurance, finance, and automotive industries.  Most recently, she architected a Solr-driven search-based portal for HBS Alumni.  Katia has an M.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from EPF Ecole d'Ingénieurs in France.

The conference will address important philosophical, ethical and technology issues that arise in the design of artificial consciousness, artificial intelligence and mind uploading. Will we be able to create super intelligent agents with consciousness and feelings? What are the limits of artificial capacities or functional simulations, we should create? Could we enhance our own humanity ? Please register here : http://www.cosmism.com/events.html Conference Description: Cosmism was originated in Russia more than a hundred years ago. That was an esoteric futuristic philosophy about post-humanity, technological immortality, resurrection and cosmic expansion. Early cosmists proposed the idea of decompaction (lightweighting) of the human body, that eventually wouldn’t need an atmosphere and would be powered directly by solar energy. They call it “radiant humanity” - a perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. Modern Cosmism brings to the original doctrine the ontological foundation, a scientific structure and a deeper comprehension of possible technology aims to create in the future a new synthetic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised. The conference will review the critical question about a potential meeting with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations and suggest few hypotheses about their “eerie silence”. We will touch some related problems in cosmology, and astrophysics such as the shape and future of the Universe, black hole information paradox, multidimensional space, dark energy and interpretation of quantum mechanics. Are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of causality? Like no other area of philosophy and technology before, Modern Cosmism raises fundamental questions about the post human nature and how it will be connected to the reality. Is the structure of reality included the consciousness? Is a non biological hardware can support the consciousness? How we can define Cosmic Evolution and what is the role of intelligent life? The conference will address important philosophical issues that arise with the future design of artificial consciousness, mind uploading and cyber-immortality. How will our concepts of subjectivity, perception, and morality change, if we will live in virtual reality of mega-consciousness environment where individuals can experience multiple presence, personality and have no gender. Will we be able to create super intelligent agents with consciousness and feelings? What are the limits of artificial capacities or functional simulations we should create? Could we enhance our own humanity by genetically redesign our nature? Our keynote and plenary speakers are well-known international protagonists of Cosmism, Transhumanism and interdisciplinary researchers. Their lectures will discuss the most important current issues of Modern Cosmism from the point of view of philosophy, technology, ethics, robotics, psychology, and anthropology.","10 Oct 2015","10:00","2 West 64 street New York",7,"busiest, market, technological, manage, new, companies, develop, year, product, inform"

He has created this event to honor fallen Marines he has known, one of whom took his life after serving abroad. He's working to create a program for veterans to get technical education to aid them in their return to the workforce and provide them with a community. While I personally am not a veteran, I have a tremendous respect for what these fine men and women have gone through and what they continue to experience. We must do better by them and this is something we all can do to help. If you're up for it make a team and do the ruck with them. If not support them with donations of time, money, and opportunity.  Today’s veteran suicide rate is 22 a day. This means that the heart-wrenching reality is that a veteran decides to take his or her own life every 60 minutes. Together, we can stop this insidious epidemic.

Refreshments will be provided at 10:30am and the talk will begin at 11:00am.  Speaker: Dennis Shasha, New York University Title: Liquid Version Climber: An Automated Tool for Upgrading Complex Software Systems Abstract: Suppose you are given a software system that is composed of a set of packages each at a particular version. You want to update some packages to their most recent versions possible, but you want your software to run after the upgrades, thus perhaps entailing changes to the versions of other packages. One approach is trial and error, but that quickly ends in frustration. We advocate a reproducibility-based approach in which tools like ptrace, reprozip, pip, and virtual machines combine to enable us to explore version combinations of different packages even on a variety of platforms. Because the space of versions to explore grows exponentially with the number of packages, we have developed a memoizing algorithm that avoids exponential search while guaranteeing an optimum version combination. This is joint work with Christophe Pradal, Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, and Patrick Valduriez. Bio: Dennis Shasha is a professor of computer science at the Courant Institute of New York University and an Associate Director of NYU Wireless. He works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial people on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, resampling statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American, Dr. Dobb's Journal, and the Communications of the ACM. He is a fellow of the ACM and an INRIA International Chair.","12 Oct 2015","10:30","33 Thomas Street New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Abstract: Autonomous moving things come in two flavors. You’ve got robots, and you’ve got biology. Seldom in the natural world do you find solutions to the problems of grasping, manipulating, and moving like the ones we’ve come up with. Instead you find complex integrated systems that distribute load and provide power in a thousand brilliant ways.   This talk introduces some biological systems (like the beak of a squid which allows a creature basically made of protein-rich jelly to bite the heads off things orders of magnitude harder than it on the durometer scale), describes the engineering behind them, and discusses methods newly minted through digital fabrication and 3d printing for duplicating them.   In Matthew’s research at Super-Releaser he’s designed pneumatic soft robots with the goal of generating complex practical mechanisms from simple, easily mass produced methods. He’s going to bring his experience making things like a walking quadruped cast from one single seamless piece of silicone to a discussion of what’s on the cutting edge of soft robotics, where these technologies can be applied, and how you can start playing with your own squishy robots. Bio:  Matthew Borgatti is the founder of Super-Releaser, a soft robotics company dedicated to bringing human compatible robots out of the lab by making their design and manufacture cheap and simple. Super-Releaser is currently developing medical device prototypes, collaborating with universities offering soft robotics manufacturing expertise, and hacking away at the core technologies involved in making better robots.  Matthew Borgatti got his start in prototyping in the film industry, making animatronic props for movies including Snakes on a Plane and Aliens Vs Predator 2. He combined the techniques he learned casting lifelike monsters in silicone with CAD and materials science learned earning an industrial design degree at RISD. He specializes in rapid prototyping, 3d printing, and DFM.  Super-Releaser, founded in 2011, is a small group of multidisciplinary artists, designers, and engineers. Their latest experiments include robotic elbow bands for rehabilitating stroke victims and methods for mass manufacturing injection molded robots.","12 Oct 2015","18:00","251 Mercer St New York",6,"will, event, well, new, network, get, come, nyc, workshop, drink"

Venue:205 E 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017( 5 min from Grand Central)  Course Overview An intensive, hands-on introduction to the Hadoop ecosystem of Big Data technologies. The emphasis in this course is on learning several of the major components of Apache Hadoop– HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, Streaming – by doing exercises of increasing complexity. Programming will be done in Python. Students are expected to be familiar with using an operating system from the command line; knowledge of Python is helpful; the material in &lt;&lt;Learn Python the Hard Way&gt;&gt; is sufficient background knowledge.  The course format is mixed lecture/lab. Students will need to bring their own laptops to connect to our server; instructions will be provided ahead of time as to how to install any required software. What is Hadoop? Hadoop is an open-source database framework that allows for the processing of large data sets using parallel computing methods. Utilizing Google’s MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop allows for scalability,flexibility and fault tolerance. Hadoop is optimized to handle massive quantities of data either structured, semi-structured, or unstructured– meaning. Hadoop is perfect for Big Data. As part of the Apache Framework, there is a host of Apache compliments such as Hive, Pig and Zookeeper, that further extend Hadoop’s applications and usability.

The Transformational Influence of Big Data in the Global Capital Markets by Paul Cassell, CIO &amp; Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, Pico  The business of financial and global capital management is bursting with hundreds of millions of transactions every day. Recent volatility in the financial markets is driving increased message traffic from electronic trading, stretching systems that simply aren’t equipped to handle such volume. With growing financial data sources and data types (such as social media, audio, and video), the need for big data technologies that can store, process and analyze this financial data is more important than ever. Join Paul Cassell, Pico CIO and former U.S. chief information officer for NYSE Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange, along with Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, as they provide details on scalable, cost-effective, best-of-breed big data technologies that you can leverage for financial data management, regulation, risk analytics, and trading analytics. You’ll come away with a better understanding of how you can harvest and leverage this data so that you can stay one step ahead of your competitors. ​Secure Collaboration on Big Data: Locking Down Doesn't Mean Locking Out by Ted Dunning, Committer for Apache Mahout, Drill, &amp; ZooKeeper Projects &amp; Chief Application Architect, MapR  Mobile payments, online banking, smart kiosks, etc. are the platforms driving bank growth for the next 20 years. All of them produce gobs of data and all of them provide opportunities for fraudsters to steal. In order to keep up, new kinds of predictive analytical models will have to be built. In order to develop these new kinds of models, we need all hands on deck, both inside and outside of financial institutions. Unfortunately, cooperation on new modeling technologies is very difficult to do without sharing sensitive data in ways that just isn't acceptable. I will describe some recently developed techniques that break this logjam. These methods are simple enough to deploy widely but provide very robust security against even the most advanced de-anonymization attacks.

The Transformational Influence of Big Data in the Global Capital Markets by Paul Cassell, CIO &amp; Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, Pico  The business of financial and global capital management is bursting with hundreds of millions of transactions every day. Recent volatility in the financial markets is driving increased message traffic from electronic trading, stretching systems that simply aren’t equipped to handle such volume. With growing financial data sources and data types (such as social media, audio, and video), the need for big data technologies that can store, process and analyze this financial data is more important than ever. Join Paul Cassell, Pico CIO and former U.S. chief information officer for NYSE Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange, along with Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, as they provide details on scalable, cost-effective, best-of-breed big data technologies that you can leverage for financial data management, regulation, risk analytics, and trading analytics. You’ll come away with a better understanding of how you can harvest and leverage this data so that you can stay one step ahead of your competitors. ​Secure Collaboration on Big Data: Locking Down Doesn't Mean Locking Out by Ted Dunning, Committer for Apache Mahout, Drill, &amp; ZooKeeper Projects &amp; Chief Application Architect, MapR  Mobile payments, online banking, smart kiosks, etc. are the platforms driving bank growth for the next 20 years. All of them produce gobs of data and all of them provide opportunities for fraudsters to steal. In order to keep up, new kinds of predictive analytical models will have to be built. In order to develop these new kinds of models, we need all hands on deck, both inside and outside of financial institutions. Unfortunately, cooperation on new modeling technologies is very difficult to do without sharing sensitive data in ways that just isn't acceptable. I will describe some recently developed techniques that break this logjam. These methods are simple enough to deploy widely but provide very robust security against even the most advanced de-anonymization attacks.  Morgan Stanley's Big Data Journey by Erwan Le Doeuff, Vice President Information Technology, Risk and Security, Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley will highlight some of the exciting things they’re doing as they expand big data projects throughout the organization, including how to start out with test projects, choose open source projects, scale systems, and produce meaningful results.

Bigger data, complex compute requirements, and cost/resource constraints are driving organizations to use cloud infrastructure. Yet existing compute- and data-intensive applications are not often designed to take advantage of infrastructure as a service. Firms must re-architect their applications to be cloud-native or ""born-in-the cloud"". Using analytics case studies as examples, Yonggang will explain the born-in-the-cloud architecture, and the opportunities and challenges that it brings. Yonggang will address the following agenda:- Introduction- Industry and Technology Context- Cloud Native Architecture- Run and Manage Cloud Native Apps- Use Cases and Benefits Come network, have some snacks, and enjoy a great presentation.

55793,51217,18334914,"220325882"," The next ten to twenty years are going to hold some major breakthroughs in energy storage and efficiency. Many of these breakthroughs will be in the realm of democratized energy  - the ability to collect, store, and sell energy from your own private property. In addition, the IoT is going to bring more ubiquitous and sensitive sensors which can monitor and optimize our energy usage on a minute-by-minute basis. The New Market For Energy Solar power currently has the most direct connection to the idea of energy democratization, due to its low cost and relative material abundance.  With the efficiencies of solar and other energy collection  and storage methods increasing, we're going to start seeing energy surpluses in private homes. The ability to sell that energy to your neighbors or to your city is going to become a reality very quickly. Sensors and IoT An increasing number of sensors and apps that measure our daily activities, from our exercise to our productivity, is going to begin to be applied to energy. A smart energy grid will be able to route the right amount of energy, at the right price, at the right time, to your home. In addition to that, you'll begin to have more visibility over how much energy you're using and how to save money and save the environment through greater energy awareness. This Think Tank All of these breakthroughs are right around the corner, and it's up to the entrepreneur and researcher to push these breakthroughs to the larger markets. At this Think Tank we'll begin to look at the current concept of a real smart energy grid. We'll brainstorm various applications of these grids, as well as the various types of systems and products that can be built ontop of them. This will be a really in-depth discussion - lots to talk about on this topic! See you there. -Dan Special thanks to Breather for an awesome meeting room!

But I kept coming back for more!” — Rob Russell, Auckland NZ Albert is not nice. Well, he’s a nice guy, but he doesn’t pull any punches. If you want to see what I mean, then come see him that Thursday night at Tekserve. Three reasons to come: 1. There are other great speakers!2. You might get SMACKED for free—that’s consulting that Albert charges top dollar for.3. Come that night, and you’ll get a $500 discount to the DESIGN Masterclass!The DESIGN Masterclass is the advanced degree of the FileMaker world. Albert has taught it for 15 years on four continents. One student called it… “The best class I ever took. It changed my life!” — Dr. Florence Haseltine, The National Institutes of Health. This is a class you can bill for, meaning you can get actual meaningful design work done on your app or solution. Some students pay for the entire cost of the class and still have some money left over. And some students return to the class two and three times: “When I took Albert’s Design Masterclass for the third time, I thought that perhaps its impact on me would finally wane. But four months later, I was still experiencing revelations about my own design work!”— Coletta Perry, Avatar DPS More quotes at DESIGNmasterclass.co So turn out on Thursday, Oct. 15th, and see what all the fuss is about.

Then he’ll take a look into where the space is headed. HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/1.1: A Performance Analysis by Ragnar Lonn, founder of Load Impact HTTP/2 is about to happen – most major browser and server makers are working on support for HTTP/2 and some, like Firefox, already have it enabled by default. The protocol is backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and is likely to suddenly become ubiquitous when new versions of clients and servers switch it on. But the web development community is still largely ignorant about HTTP/2 and what it means for their applications. This talk will outline the results of a new study by Ragnar Lonn, founder of Load Impact, where we attempt to measure the performance impact different types of applications would typically face if they switch their data transport from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2. As an extra treat, Ragnar will also release the software created as part of the study — a free online tool for developers to find out what happens performance-wise if their site or application is delivered over HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1. -------------------------------------------------- BIO &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/xebialabs""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Load Impact CTO Robin Gustafsson is a system architecture expert who’s been working with the company since it was founded in 2009. Robin specializes in performance testing, software architecture, cloud and distributed computing, and Continuous Delivery in software development. Ragnar Lonn is founder and CEO of Load Impact, the world’s most popular online load testing service for testing the performance of websites. Load Impact users have executed over 300,000 load tests since 2009. Previously Ragnar worked in the ISP industry, and founded one of Sweden’s first internet service providers (Algonet, 1994).

But Doug Cutting, the Hadoop creator, predicted that, in the future, organizations will run all sorts of workloads on their Hadoop clusters, even online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads. Although Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix provide high throughput, low latency, random access on big data, developers struggle with the lack of ACID transactions. Trafodion is a world class Transactional SQL RDBMS running on HBase/Hadoop, currently in Apache incubation. In this talk we will discuss the characteristic of operational workloads, the operational use cases Trafodion addresses, and why Trafodion is the right solution for these use cases. In particular, we go in depth of what is the recipe for a world class database engine, and how Trafodion implements the ingredients that make up that recipe such as world class query optimizer, parallel data flow execution engine, distributed transaction management system, performance, scale, availability, and future directions, etc. Speaker:Rohit Jain is the CTO at Esgyn for Trafodion, a transactional SQL-on-HBase RDBMS.

We hope this will highlight the potential of neural networks to solve a large set of the data challenges faced by financial institutions. Specifically we’ll show how we applied recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) using a regularization technique called “dropout” to financial data. We extend work done by Zaremba, Sutskever, and Vinyals in Recurrent Neural Network Regularization.

Common Mistakes and Best Practices Hazelcast is a popular open source In-Memory Data Grid that is extremely powerful and easy to use. Hazelcast provides many distributed and highly scalable data structures such as Map, Queue, Lock and Executor Service. It also has many powerful capabilities like listeners, WAN replication, and query functionality. It is possible to implement applications that are very scalable and capable. However, power comes with responsibility and misuse can cause degrading performance and application scalability. In this talk, we will talk about some of the best practices and mistakes to avoid while using Hazelcast. We assume that the audience is familiar with Hazelcast or an alternative IMDG. You will leave this session knowing the core principles and best practices for the following features: - WAN Replication- Queries- Listeners- Executor Service- Queue

Microsoft Ventures is a global initiative empowering entrepreneurs around the world on their journey to build great companies. Microsoft Ventures is focused on building partnerships with venture funds, angel investors, incubators, accelerators, corporate executives, and at the core startups, as well as run its own accelerators around the world. Our goal and objective is to help scale and grow startups by giving them a great working environment, access to mentors and service providers, free technological tools and connecting them to Microsoft’s customers and business partners. The next batch of the program opens on Feb 2016 and it’s going to be themed around Machine Learning and Data Science. We will be targeting startups that are a more mature than previous batches – such that raised $1M-$1.5M, with an existing product and maybe even initial traction.  The 4-month program offers the following unique and distinctive benefits to the startups:  • No Equity Program – all the benefits in the program are totally free, takes no equity or any other type of payment or special rights in the companies.  • Technology agnostic – companies can be accepted to the program using any technology they want. It’s up to the company to decide whether they use Microsoft’s technologies to boost their growth or use any other infrastructure that fits their need. Having said that, startups that choose to use Azure will enjoy the help of the Machine Learning product group in architecting their solutions to the right size and using the cutting edge services Azure ML offers.  • Access to the Microsoft distribution channel – Microsoft Ventures is committed to help startups who have relevant products to our customers and partners get connected to them through our massive distribution channels. In addition, startups will receive assistance in getting set up on the Azure Marketplace allowing the Microsoft sales reps to sell their solutions with higher incentives.  • Free of Microsoft Azure – startups in the program will be automatically enrolled to BizSpark Plus program and be credited for $500K of cloud usage (storage and compute) for 3 years, to be used in their own pace. This allows the startup to focus on the crucial business aspects of their company.","21 Oct 2015","18:00","44 West Fourth Street  Room 2-60 New York",7,"busiest, market, technological, manage, new, companies, develop, year, product, inform"

Do read the material before the meeting, but it's okay if you don't understand all of it!  If you get stuck somewhere, make a note of where.  It's likely others got stuck in the same place!  Try to push through and understand as much of the rest of the material as possible.  We'll try to get everyone on the same page at the meeting! We're still figuring out the pace for this book, so if it feels like we couldn't possibly cover all the material in an evening, you might be right!  We'll discuss our pace for the material at the meeting.  If the content is too dense, we can have multiple meetings covering the same sections.  If it's very interesting, we can have meetings covering supplemental materials! You can ask questions about the material in our piazza course page, using the access code stats101 ! -- and it supports latex!  http://piazza.com/nyc_ml_study_group/fall2015/stats101  Recommended Pre-requisites: • Probability Theory (beginner): Know what a joint and conditional distribution is.  Know what marginalizing is. • Graphical Models (beginner): Know what a graphical model is.  Know how to factorize a joint distribution given a graph.  Know the term ""directed, acyclic graph"".

Jurgis Orups, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Clusterpoint RSVP NOW: http://www.NYCSQL.com/events/225397952/ A Database Month event: http://www.DatabaseMonth.com/database/database-computing Databases are typically utilized for storing data, but data is only useful if it is being turned into actionable insights. In this session we will explore an important adjacent-role of the database, to efficiently perform computations and create derived data. Relational databases have been successful for several decades now because they provide a well defined computational framework, which is built on top of relational algebra. The relational algebra defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data. However, times change and we are presently in a situation where relational databases do not easily scale to the amounts of data that businesses and organizations around the world are dealing with. NoSQL technology has emerged as an attempt to address this, but NoSQL loses the computational aspect. The majority of NoSQL databases are glorified key-value stores that support CRUD operations, but do not define a solid computational model. Alternatively, MapReduce defines a computational framework to process large amounts of data, but has its own caveats. It encourages batch processing and full-scans of data, so the computation becomes detached from stored data. It is our belief that the data management industry will move into the direction of consolidating storage, which will allow computing power and new databases to emerge; these will both scale to data storage needs as well as provide a solid online computational framework. This session will teach you about a computing engine that is built into the database and allows arbitrary JavaScript-based code to be executed directly in the database, next to the data. This setup provides a simple and powerful computational model that ensures data is accessed through efficient indices directly in the database, thus massively accelerating data manipulation operations. Throughout this talk, we will present examples of how advanced computation can be done directly in the database, including an analysis of geospatial data, and the application of statistical model-like logistic regression to derive predictions.

58505,56332,1977421,"225858045","ABSTRACT In spite of growing popularity of data visualization, the major problem in business communication is yet to be solved. Most business reports still fall somewhere between messy spreadsheets and dashboards, that simply do not get the message across to the decision-makers. Countless reports and presentations are created throughout organizations daily, all in different formats, lengths, shapes and colors, depending on personal preferences of the person who prepares them.  Dr. Hichert’s International Business Communication Standards (IBCS) are world’s first proposal for a standardized design of business communication. IBCS consistently defines shapes and colors of actuals and budgets, variances, different KPIs, etc. The “traffic signs for management” are an extensive set of rules and recommendations that went viral in Europe and have solved business communication problems in companies such as SAP, Coca-Cola bottlers, Bayer, Lufthansa, BMW, Philips, etc. The IBCS standards are not just about charts. They help (1) organize and structure your content by using an appropriate storyline, (2) present your content by using an appropriate visual design and (3) standardize the content by using a consistent,uniform notation. We'll present the key features of IBCS through real-world examples (https://zebra.bi/gallery/) and discuss their slightly controversial proposition: the design of business information should look (more or less) the same across all companies, regardless of their size, industry or location. BIO Andrej Lapajne, CEO at Zebra BI (https://zebra.bi), is a founding member of the IBCS Association (http://ibcs-a.org) and one of Dr. Hichert's closest associates. In his 15 years of experience as a consultant, he's helped 50+ international and regional companies achieve consistent and efficient internal reporting throughout the organisation. He's implemented reporting systems and business intelligence dashboards in pharma, telco, retail, FMCG, manufacturing, insurance, banking, energy, media, public sector and high tech industries. Andrej is a lecturer on information design at Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Computer Science and Informatics in Ljubljana. He's a frequent speaker at European conferences, utterly passionate about data visualization.","22 Oct 2015","18:30"," ",7,"busiest, market, technological, manage, new, companies, develop, year, product, inform"

Visions of the Future is a showcase night of cutting-edge multimedia art and performance focusing on new forms of audio-visual interpretation about visions of the future. The night will feature eight leading artists presenting works of immersive audience experience. It will be presented in partnership with CultureHub at their new space in La MaMa.  Artists involved include: Catalonian Cyborg pioneers Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas. Harbisson will perform A Concert from Space via his antenna that is embedded into his skull. Ribas will showcase her piece Waiting for Earthquakes, where she connects her sensors to the seismology satellite in space and dance as earthquakes happen at any given moment, The two artists will perform simultaneously.  MSHR duo and Portland-based artists Brenna Murphy and Birch Cooper produce unusual installations and live performances that revolve around a unique system of light-audio feedback, employing handmade synthesizers, sculptural interfaces and ritualistic shamanic performances, placing the human body into a dynamic relationship between the ultra-terrestrial and the tribal.  Juan Cortes and Ricardo Arias, both artists visiting from Bogota, Colombia for MOMA’s hybrid media exhibition, present their latest performance collaborating as “The Migrants”. Tidal Flares is a performance-installation that draws its inspiration from the dramatic effect of solar flares on the Earth’s behaviors, in both its organic and its inorganic systems. The performers will interfere/interact with this activity via sensors in ways akin to those deployed by certain biological organisms such as bioluminiscent algae, frogs, tarantulas etc.  Yucef Merhi, a New York based Venezuelan artist, will present Facial Poetry, a playful multiuser installation where facial gestures are transformed into hundreds of poems.  Mark Bolotin will showcase The Lumiphonic Creature Choir, a futuristic installation which consists of a giant twelve-headed multimedia creature that triggers faces talking about their vision of the future. The audience will be able to interact and play directly with the voices and sounds of the Creature Choir.

We 1) start with a hypothesis, 2) we analyze the data, 3) we find insights, and then 4) we visualize our thesis. The visualization's purpose: communicate insight. I have a theory that the opposite process leads to far better results: 1) visualize the data and then 2) do everything else. The best data visualizations create active readers who can explore datasets and develop their own perspective. When we start with visualization, we place ourselves in the shoes of a reader with no context. Instead of proving a point, we force ourselves to create the tools and design appropriate for exploration. In short: this means avoiding excel at all costs: make visualizations that help you find insights for your story, not the other way around. In this talk, we'll discuss the emerging notion of Explorable Explanations, and why the best visualizations, from the NY Times to Bloomberg, seem to be following a new design paradigm – one beyond anything that Tufte could have imagined. I'll illustrate this approach for a few of my projects: Rappers, sorted by the size of their vocabulary Using Spotify to measure the popularity of older music Hip hop labels, sorted by their artists' chart performance on Billboard Bio: Matt Daniels is designer and developer, as well as editor of Polygraph, an online magazine for data-driven journalism.

Speakers:  Nathaniel Davis A New System. A New Architecture. A New Model. Understanding, building and maintaining a digital ecosystem requires a broader meaning of the term “system architecture.” A system architecture must express more than the function of information technology (IT). It must include the architecture of our human engagement with technology and the context within which our human and technology interactions persist. As a result, a new reference model for system architecture is paramount. In this talk, Nathaniel will discuss the organizational and collaborative challenges that business stakeholders, product managers, technologists, UI designers, usability engineers, user experience designers and information science professionals face to create and manage human-centered digital ecosystems. Nathaniel will propose a new model for digital experience architecture and call for digital professionals to advocate a new digital “system” that thrives on the coherent and thoughtful architecture of both design and infrastructure. Nathaniel Davis is the author of the upcoming book “Information Architecture: Theory, Science and Practice” due in 2016. Nathaniel is a veteran of information architecture, web strategy and design. He advises on IA and UX strategy and is founder of the DSIA Research Initiative where he curates the DSIA Portal of Information Architecture - a public knowledge base of articles and resources based on his research. Nathaniel is the information architecture columnist for UXmatters and a contributing guest writer for the Bulletin of The Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T). In addition to curating the DSIA Research Initiative, Nathaniel Davis serves as director of information architecture for a Fortune 100 company.

A common implementation provides individualized follow-up assignments for struggling students.   Using observed data, we show how to use bootstrapping and rejection sampling to create a valid comparative study of groups of students who do and don’t use adaptive technology, even when the samples are not uncorrelated. Hillary Green-Lerman is a member of the research team at Knewton. As a data scientist at Knewton, she designs and implements studies that provide quantitative evidence of the potential of Knewton-powered products to improve student learning outcomes. Previously, Hillary worked as a scientific associate at D.E. Shaw Research, where she performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of protein-drug interactions on the Anton supercomputers, and published her findings in Nature. She holds a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, she has spoken at NYC Python Meetup, Biophysical Society, and Protein Society, and has written about women in STEM for Lilith Magazine. Kevin's talk: A common problem faced by the NBA and Knewton are evaluating (groups of) people's skills. The NBA cares about who is the best basketball team. Knewton cares whether or not you have mastered a particular skill. These problems may be modeled in strikingly similar ways. In this talk, we step through why these situations may be modeled so similarly as well as how their different evaluation metrics affect our confidence in the models' performance. Kevin Wilson is a principal data scientist at Knewton. During his tenure there, he has helped build, implement, and evaluate the proficiency and other models which serve millions of students using Knewton's recommendation engine. Before Knewton, he received his PhD in mathematics from Princeton and his bachelor's in mathematics from the University of Michigan.","27 Oct 2015","18:30","100 Fifth Ave. (at 15th St.) 8th Floor New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

About the talk: Every day when I wake up, I ask myself ""Would I rather be sleeping?"" If the answer is yes, I go back to sleep. Once in a while I wake up, and sometimes I even program something. And once I'm tired of that, I go back to sleep, regardless of whether the programming is finished. This work schedule lends itself to a style of programming that efficiently produces robust, simple, user-friendly data analysis software. I'll introduce the main principles behind my approach to writing data analysis software. Next, I'll present some common problems that my programming style completely avoids. Finally, I'll discuss how my programming style is well suited for certain projects and horribly inappropriate for others. Some main ideas include: • I store the most raw form of data that I can, and then I think of my entire program as pure functions. To make it easy to store raw forms of data, I wrote vlermv, a library that maps Python dictionaries to files. • Systems should be so simple and legible that I can figure out how they worked after I have lost the source code and the documentation and only have the data. • I have a particular way of drawing flow charts. Based on what the flow chart looks like, I can identify problems with the design of the software. About Tom: Thomas Levine is a neodadaist. In addition to sleep, he is interested in multisensory data plots, ""data"", and letterpress printing. He writes frequently; popular works include a shell testing framework, research on the publishing of government open data, a spreadsheet-based music sequencer, tutorials and discussions on data, and a study on the vicious hovering cycle of toilet usage.

Two of the speakers will be investors in early stage life science companies and the third speaker an investor in other early stage companies. The panelists will also offer candid views and discussion on how to prepare a company for raising angel capital or seed stage investment, the raise itself, and how to work with angel groups or seed investors after getting the investment.

Presented by: Rich Tarro, Big Data Architect  Spark is hot and is certainly generating a lot of buzz in the industry. Spark is fundamentally shifting the way data and analytics are exploited by organizations by putting analytics into action where and when it is needed. With Spark, algorithms and big data models can be developed and built quickly with faster iterations enabling intelligence to be embedded into applications for web, mobile, social, Internet of Things as well as business process applications – enabling analytics to take a key role in the way an organization operates and makes decisions. In this session we will explore the technology behind Spark, how it enables such fast processing, its ease of use in writing applications, and how it can combine different types of analytics such as SQL and machine learning seamlessly in the same application. In addition, we will look at Spark in the context of IBM Bluemix, which not only offers an integrated experience for data scientists and analysts to perform interactive analytics with Spark, but also enables Spark applications to  take advantage of the wide range of services available on Bluemix.

The historic snow lead to problems with public works, infrastructure, and community access to services. Plus, remember the nightmare that was the MBTA? Out of the mess, a Code for Boston team created the award winning MBTA.ninja, a crowd-sourcing method for reporting transit delays. And it's awesome. But this year, we decided to try to get ahead of things. So #HackWinter 2015 is here! #HackWinter 2015 is a three-and-a-half week app challenge focusing on winter-specific apps that can help our community in the focus areas of Transit, Infrastructure, and Community. Over the next few weeks, we'll be reaching out to Public Works Departments in the Greater Boston Area as well as community groups, public health agencies, and more to serve as problem owners for the challenge.

Rather than doing a broad re:Invent recap as we sometimes have in the past, we will be joined by Richard Threlkeld, an Solutions Architect from Amazon, to present and demo the capabilities of their new services. Following the IoT talk we will hear from Simulmedia who has accumulated a significant amount of leanings from the development of their ETL pipelines and Redshift based Datawarehouse. If you are interested in the Big Data space, don't miss this opportunity to benefit from their experience. For more on the sessions see below:  AWS IoT Services We will have a brief overview of the AWS IoT service and a demo using industry hardware. This scenario will leverage the Shadow functionality of AWS IoT and invoke automated processes based upon the built-in rules engine. Additionally we'll also dive into some of the finer service details such as MQTT, Pub/Sub architecture and security controls.  Building a Data Warehouse in AWS Hear from Simulmedia's Data Engineering team about how they built out their Data Warehouse using AWS services like Redshift, S3 and EC2. This will be a deep dive into the stack that supports one of the largest collections of TV viewing data in the world. In addition to this, the data team will also explain two of their guiding principles that have made their lives much easier - immutability in ETL pipelines and maintaining state within the Data Warehouse.  Logistics Food and beverages will be served. Doors open at 6 PM and the program will begin at 6:30. A special thanks to Simulmedia's for hosting this event! Simulmedia, Inc., a New York based marketing technology company founded in 2009, is the leader in driving guaranteed business outcomes for advertisers through traditional TV marketing. Simulmedia’s VAMOS platform is powered by the world’s largest database of information on what people watch and buy, combined with access to TV inventory that reaches 95% of U.S. TV households.

During this presentation, Ben Sharma will address how a “managed” Hadoop data lake can serve as an ideal data acquisition hub for RDARR analytics and reporting. He will address architectural considerations and required capabilities. Odyssey: A Look at The Evolution of Big Data Ingestion Pipelines by Steve Morin, CTO, Nvent Data  Get an overview of the maturing Big Data ecosystem as companies move more towards real-time analytics tools that ingest, extract, translate, and then clean up data for analysis. You'll also get a look at a data ingestion pipeline architecture, how it has evolved over time, and its use cases in today's big data landscape.​ Cisco IT's Hadoop Journey by Robert Novak, Big Data Consulting Systems Engineer, Cisco  In this talk, you'll get insights into Cisco’s own Hadoop journey and how Cisco implemented a highly agile enterprise Hadoop platform, delivering multiple use cases including ETL migration, content management, smart analytics and compliance. The Transformational Influence of Big Data in the Global Capital Markets by Paul Cassell, CIO &amp; Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, Pico  The business of financial and global capital management is bursting with hundreds of millions of transactions every day. Recent volatility in the financial markets is driving increased message traffic from electronic trading, stretching systems that simply aren’t equipped to handle such volume. With growing financial data sources and data types (such as social media, audio, and video), the need for big data technologies that can store, process and analyze this financial data is more important than ever. Join Paul Cassell, Pico CIO and former U.S. chief information officer for NYSE Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange, along with Daniel Bartucci, Director of Corporate Development, as they provide details on scalable, cost-effective, best-of-breed big data technologies that you can leverage for financial data management, regulation, risk analytics, and trading analytics. You’ll come away with a better understanding of how you can harvest and leverage this data so that you can stay one step ahead of your competitors. ​Secure Collaboration on Big Data: Locking Down Doesn't Mean Locking Out by Ted Dunning, Committer for Apache Mahout, Drill, &amp; ZooKeeper Projects &amp; Chief Application Architect, MapR  Mobile payments, online banking, smart kiosks, etc. are the platforms driving bank growth for the next 20 years. All of them produce gobs of data and all of them provide opportunities for fraudsters to steal. In order to keep up, new kinds of predictive analytical models will have to be built. In order to develop these new kinds of models, we need all hands on deck, both inside and outside of financial institutions. Unfortunately, cooperation on new modeling technologies is very difficult to do without sharing sensitive data in ways that just isn't acceptable. I will describe some recently developed techniques that break this logjam. These methods are simple enough to deploy widely but provide very robust security against even the most advanced de-anonymization attacks.  Morgan Stanley's Big Data Journey by Erwan Le Doeuff, Vice President Information Technology, Risk and Security, Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley will highlight some of the exciting things they’re doing as they expand big data projects throughout the organization, including how to start out with test projects, choose open source projects, scale systems, and produce meaningful results.

Bigger data, complex compute requirements, and cost/resource constraints are driving organizations to use cloud infrastructure. Yet existing compute- and data-intensive applications are not often designed to take advantage of infrastructure as a service. Firms must re-architect their applications to be cloud-native or ""born-in-the cloud"". Using analytics case studies as examples, Yonggang will explain the born-in-the-cloud architecture, and the opportunities and challenges that it brings. Yonggang will address the following agenda:- Introduction- Industry and Technology Context- Cloud Native Architecture- Run and Manage Cloud Native Apps- Use Cases and Benefits Come network, have some snacks, and enjoy a great presentation.

Marc will give you a brief recap of the highlights, learn about what’s new with Oracle Application Express and related technologies. Patrick Maniraho - Android Apps Consuming APEX Web Services: RESTful web services are application programming interfaces (API) that can be accessed through the HTTP protocol. Oracle APEX RESTful web services allow us to expose data to other systems as JSON feeds. In this demo, we will see how we can leverage these tools to create and consume web services to mobile ecosystem (an Android app that consumes the APEX web services).   Dan McGhan - How We Implemented ""Extended Session"" in apex.world:  Hopefully you've all heard of the new community site for APEX, &lt;a&gt;http://apex.world,&lt;/a&gt; by now.  One little feature of that site that I helped implement was the ""extended session"" or permanent login that users can optionally enable. This prevents them from having to enter their credentials when they return to the site in the future. In this session I'll provide an overview of how this was achieved! Also, we'll be giving away a free copy of the recently released book: Expert Oracle Application Express, 2nd Edition.

You have petabytes of it, with streams collected from every device. But are you using it to learn more about your users or your system? In this presentation I will walk through leveraging pattern mining along with ML techniques to identify frequent patterns that exist in your logs. I apply these techniques to a real-world application, developing the 'Frequently Bought Together' feature we have all seen on Amazon. After going through the intuition in the frequent pattern mining algorithm, I will show how you don't need to be an expert in order to get results quickly. The entire presentation will be delivered from an iPython Notebook and written in Python, using Dato for performing the frequent pattern mining, model training, and deployment of the frequently bought together service.

70377,69783,18334914,"226581642"," What will the business world look like 100 years from now?  Age-old paradigms are shifting in the communication, commerce, lifestyle, and employment worlds. And they're shifting fast. Those paradigms and traditions have been entrenched for decades. Some even centuries. They dictate how we work together, our expectations of employers and employees, and even how we identify ourselves.  So what happens when those systems are upended? Technology has introduced more disruptions to the business world in the last 10 years than in the previous 100 - and it's just starting.  First, the technology. New systems of communication have enabled asynchronous workflows and a new freelance economy, crowd technology has enabled economies of scale for businesses of all size when it comes to funding and resource searches, and automation has radically shifted investment focus in both the corporate and startup worlds. Second, the social awareness. The companies that grow fast are going to be the ones who attach themselves to a meaningful social mission. Communication is now global, and the public has a much more transparent awareness of the impact businesses have on the world. Those who embrace this and engineer business to give back to the world instead of take from it will succeed. (A freaking awesome example of this in action &gt;&gt;&gt;) Let's get to it! I'm excited and proud to be leading the discussion at this upcoming Think Tank. Not only because it's an area of intense passion for me, but also because, as a result of us living in a capitalist society, business lies at the heart of enabling innovation.  The speed at which the business world is shifting is at once fascinating and frightening - and the ones who move fastest will be the only ones able to keep up 5-10 years out. So let's dive in and look at what's changing, how to react to it, and the new opportunities that are coming out of these new paradigms and new traditions. See you there! -Dan PS - Special thanks to Breather for providing a great space to meet!

Wouldn’t it be great to preserve the experience and data model also when you run complex analytic queries and Big Data workloads? When using RDBMSs, people who need analytics often couple a warehouse such as Netezza, Vertica or Teradata with their RDBMS OLTP database. In the NoSQL world the equivalent is SonarW. SonarW is a Big Data warehouse that looks and feels like MongoDB – it is 100% mongo-compliant, stores JSON, and has the same simplicity and elegance of MongoDB – but inside it is a column-store, it can run a single query using many threads, it indexes all fields (even thousands) using big data indexes that won’t blow up memory, and more. The result is that you can store many TBs of JSON data on a single commodity node and run aggregation queries that complete in seconds. In this Meetup we delve into how SonarW works, what it does well (and what not so well) and how to use it in-tandem with MongoDB to provide fast analytics on JSON data. Speaker: Ron Bennatan worked with RDBMSs and Hadoop for 20 years before seeing the light and moving to work with NoSQL and MongoDB. He is a co-founder of jSonar and the principal author of JSON Studio. Before that he was the CTO for Big Data Governance at IBM. He authored 10 technical books on topics such as databases, WebSphere and CORBA. Talk 2: What's New in MongoDB 3.2 New generations of database technologies are allowing organizations to build applications never before possible, at a speed and scale that were previously unimaginable. MongoDB is the fastest growing database on the planet, and the new 3.2 release will bring the benefits of modern database architectures to an ever broader range of applications and users.

We deal with many varied data sets across different business units, including auction data, campaigns, behavior and content. Data sizes are in petabytes across multi-100 node clusters. Given the heterogeneous development and production environments across our different groups, we are missing out on the opportunity for uniting the capabilities and experience of many strong data scientists across the organization through easy sharing of knowledge and expertise gained over challenging project experiences. In this discussion, we will share the types of problems we tackle and the ways that we approach solving them through machine learning and data engineering. We will touch on some of the practical issues involved, such as data challenges and production deployment challenges. We will also talk about the platforms we have used and what we are still looking for in terms of an Enterprise-grade machine learning platform. BIO - GIRI IYENGAR Giri Iyengar is a Chief Architect in the Data Services tribe at AOL Platforms. He works on Data Science projects and bringing them into production at large scale at AOL. At AOL he has worked on pricing models, forecasting models, user matching models and yield optimization. Prior to AOL, he was the CTO of Velos, a Machine Learning startup that was acquired by AOL earlier this year. He started his career as a Research Scientist at IBM TJ Watson Lab after his PhD from MIT. -------------------------------------------------------- 2.  Presentation by IBM Open Source Analytics - Domain Specific Analytics with System ML. Declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) in SystemML aims at flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations to distributed computations on MapReduce or Spark. ML algorithms are expressed in an R-like syntax or a Python-like syntax, that includes linear algebra primitives, statistical functions, and ML-specific constructs. This high-level language significantly increases the productivity of data scientists as it provides:- full flexibility in expressing custom analytics, anddata independence from the underlying input formats and physical data representations.- automatic optimization according to data and cluster characteristics ensures both efficiency and scalability. As such, SystemML differs from existing work on large-scale ML libraries, which mostly provide fixed algorithms and runtime plans. In June 2015, IBM announced to open source SystemML and include it in the Apache Spark project. The open source repository is here: https://github.com/SparkTC/systemml This meetup will provide a high level overview of System ML and cover use cases and client examples of how System ML is used. 3.

72181,71444,18682532,"226617753"," Our lives have become immersed in data.  When connected to a device, every little action we take is logged.  This data by itself is meaningless.  For it to be useful, it must tell a story.  We've built up tools to store the data, to analyze the data, and to visualize the data.  But what is the language of immersive data?  How do we use data to make people feel?  How do we explain the big picture from millions of tiny details?  This is the next frontier in storytelling.  Documentary web applications are popping up to explain social issues with our data.  Virtual Reality is positioning itself as an 'empathy engine' to help people connect with data on a visceral level.  In our social media saturated cosmopolitan environment, we are told crude stories about how a million people shared a moment in 140 characters or less.  But data can tell us so much more.  Good data visualization can explain mathematics in less than a second, it can tell us about demographic migrations and epochal shifts at a glance.  The language of data will one day be as robust as the language of film or the language of music, and our stories will be told in ways that will cause our imaginations to explode with an abundance of information.   Panelists: Debra Anderson is the Founder &amp; Chief Strategy Officer at Datavized, an immersive design studio focused the intersection of virtual reality and data visualization. A producer/director specialized in digital storytelling and media impact, she builds data-driven and researched based approaches to immersive experiences. Her VR film In/Formation, is a two part (25 min) immersive documentary explored through 3D 360-degree stereoscopic virtual reality, investigating the creative use of the technology to build empathy and new forms of storytelling. She is a producer for projects at the crossroads of VR, neuroscience, AI, journalism, technology and gaming including The Enemy, SoundSelf and Less Than Human. Debra founded the innovation firm Culture Shock in 2007 and has presented groundbreaking interactive works with the NFB at Sundance New Frontier and Tribeca Storyscapes.

72223,79404,16973312,"226208289","Let's meetUp and talk about how to use messy user-interaction (log file or clickstream) data from a Natural Selection app to auto-score specific responses using a rules-based scorer and a machine learning classifier. Abstract The first step towards adaptive learning in simulations and games is being able to rationalize what the student has done—to articulate the evidence rules as described by an evidence-centered design approach. The subsequent response scoring process gives us the raw data for input into statistical models for adaptive learning. As we move towards three dimensional science assessment as defined by the Next Generation Science Standards we need new automated methods for translating digital work products to scored observable variables. I will present aspects of the response scoring process we are building at Amplify Science—a brand new, digitally-enhanced core curriculum for K-8 science. Students use web-based scientific simulations to explore, experiment with, and model complex scientific phenomena. Automated scoring of responses to these complex performance tasks is non-trivial because there are many potential features to score for any one response or process. I will show how we use messy user-interaction (log file or clickstream) data from a Natural Selection app to auto-score specific responses using a rules-based scorer and a machine learning classifier. I estimate task validity using a comparative analysis of content-expert ratings, evidence rule scoring, and machine learning approaches. The machine learning approaches are shown to agree with expert human scoring as well or better than human-written scoring rules. We are continuing to develop our approach to automated scoring using additional validation and scoring methods. Bio Samuel Crane is the analytics lead and a Project Principal on the K-8 Science curriculum product at Amplify. He holds a Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior from CUNY. His dissertation work on computational biology was conducted at the American Museum of Natural History and the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics. With Amplify, he’s now developing novel analytical approaches to measuring student achievement on technology-enhanced assessments, curriculum apps, and digital simulations using a variety of approaches including item response theory, data mining, and machine learning.","16 Nov 2015","18:30","3 Park Avenue, 30th Floor New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

About five years ago, our research group moved to New York City after almost a decade at the University of Utah. While many academic moves have negligible effect on the research program of faculty members, our move has had a profound effect in the research topics being pursued,and also in how our research is being translated into practice. The collaboration with NYC agencies and companies (including AT&amp;T, KPF, and MLB.com) have fundamentally impacted our projects by providing astrong foundation of real problems to be solved. 

In this talk, we will describe some projects in urban datavisualization and sports analytics. In particular, we will describe Urbane, a 3D framework to support data driven decision making in urban development, developed in collaboration with Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF), and the Baseball Metrics Engine, which is part ofMLB.com's Statcast (developed in collaboration with Dr. Carlos Dietrich). This work has a large number of collaborators, including Juliana Freire, Huy Vo, Harish Doraiswamy, Theo Damoulas, Nivan Ferreira, Marcos Lage, Luc Wilson, Heidi Werner, and Muchan Park. Our work has been funded by grants/gifts from Moore and Sloan Foundations, NSF, NASA, DOE, MLB.com, DARPA, The State of New York, AT&amp;T, and IBM. 


Bio: Claudio Silva is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. Claudio’s research lies in the intersection of visualization, data analysis, and geometric computing, and recently he has been interested in the analysis of urban and sports data. Silva's work has received a number of major awards. In 2013, he was elected an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow and in 2014 he won the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award. He helped develop MLB.com's Statcast player tracking system, which won the Alpha Award for Best Analytics Innovation/Technology at the 2015 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. In 2015, he was elected Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Visualization and Computer Graphics.","17 Nov 2015","18:30","55 East 52nd Street New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

According to Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, $16 billion was stolen from 12.7 million identity fraud victims in 2014. Banks have long employed statistical models to fight fraud, but with the exponential increase in fraudulent activities, banks now need scalable and automated technology solutions to combat it. In this talk, we’ll walk through two distinct use cases. We will explore the model for fraud detection at Integral Ad Science. We will also discuss how banks are using successfully Hadoop ecosystem technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache HBase, and Apache Spark (among others) to handle fraud detection across multiple channels. This discussion will cover batch and streaming architectures with a focus on the financial services, but the concepts will be applicable across industries.

73249,77807,11398322,"226193314","We're delighted to have our old friend, Tom Santero, software engineer at Helium and current FOCO resident, presenting on Buridan's Principle, a paper by Turing Award-winner, Leslie Lamport. Intro  In 1984 Leslie Lamport began to observe the glitch problem [0] occurs in everyday life. Realizing this phenomenon had not been discussed by psychologists of the day, he set out to describe his observations using the classical formalization of Buridan's ass. Lamport initially failed to have this paper published in various scientific journals, being rejected on grounds of superficiality. It wasn't until 2011, when a reader suggested he resubmit to Foundations of Physics, that the paper was eventually published. Those familiar with the works of Lamport know him as a logician, his life's work has pushed forward the state of the art in areas of mutual exclusion and distributed systems probably more than any other, and so reading Buridan's Principle might strike us as a bit odd, or even obscure. We're in unfamiliar territory with Lamport. Nonetheless, in this paper, Lamport's casual observations lead him to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, providing us readers with what appears to be a universal law of nature: Buridan's Principle.  [0] http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf Bio &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""http://tomasp.net""&gt; Tom Santero (@tsantero) is a Software Engineer at Helium Systems, writing Haskell and Erlang to connect things to the internet. Previously, Tom worked at the New York Times on Search infrastructure, and before that he ran evangelism at Basho Technologies.

It takes models, theories and intuition to make use of data.  Models are metaphors that explain the world we don’t understand, in terms of worlds we do. They tell you only what something is more or less like.  Theories are descriptions that try to tell you what something really is.  It takes great intuition to discover a correct theory. Emanuel is a professor at Columbia University, where he directs their program in financial engineering. He is the author of My Life As A Quant. His latest book is Models.Behaving.Badly: Why Confusing Illusion with Reality Can Lead to Disasters,On Wall Street and in Life. He was born in South Africa but has lived most of his professional life in Manhattan in New York City, where he has made contributions to several fields. He started out as a theoretical physicist, doing research on unified theories of elementary particle interactions. He worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the 1980s. From 1985 to 2002 he worked on Wall Street, running quantitative strategies research groups in fixed income, equities and risk management, and was appointed a managing director at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in 1997. The financial models he developed there, the Black-Derman-Toy interest rate model and the Derman-Kani local volatility model, have become widely used industry standards. He has a B.Sc. from University of Cape Town in Physics, and a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Columbia University.

74457,71583,18706743,"226210234"," Explorations in Urban Data Science Across the world, the Open Data movement is growing and more and more cities are releasing data to the public.  As citizens push for more openness, it is fair to ask: what can we do with all of this data to make our cities better?  In this talk, Ben will explore how he has used his blog, I Quant NY, and Data Science to make changes in the city he lives in: New York City.  From parking ticket geography, to restaurant inspection scores to subway and taxi pricing, Ben will discuss best practices for data science in the policy space, explore how story telling is an important aspect of data science and highlight the various data-driven interactions he has had with City agencies. Along the way, Ben will point out that data science need not use complicated math.  He will show examples of the power of simple arithmetic, and show how often it is more about your curiosity and the questions you ask than the complexity of the equations you use.  Ben Wellington is the creator of I Quant NY, a data science and policy blog that focuses on insights drawn from New York City's public data, and advocates for the expansion and improvement of that data.   His work has influenced local government policy (including changes in the way New Yorkers pay for cabs and a new button on NYC subway vending machines!).  He is a contributor to The New Yorker, and is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the City &amp; Regional Planning program at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.  Ben is a Quantitative Analyst at Two Sigma and holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from New York University. Don't you wish you could use the same machine learning models for data sets with 100 rows and 1Bn rows? Ufora has built an automatically distributed, implicitly parallel data science engine for running large-scale machine learning applications.  This talk will cover how the platform works, in terms of data and thread distribution, how it generates parallel processes out of single-threaded programs, and some recent developments for data scientists working in Python. Ufora's core IP allows data scientists to leverage powerful distributing computing without being forced to engineer complex infrastructure by hand or work within constrained frameworks. This approach introduces some interesting challenges, like automatically detecting and implementing optimal data layouts for different ML models. For instance, linear regressions, logistic regressions, GBM's, and kNN all require different data layouts to perform well at scale, but architecting these layouts by hand is non-trivial and doesn't enable flexibility as datasets change and scale.  Ronen Hilewicz (VP of Engineering) started engineering professionally at age 18 in the Israeli military, working on SIGINT systems. After the military, he worked at a Tel Aviv-based startup building browser security technology. In 2004, Ronen joined Microsoft where he worked on Windows internals before shifting his attention to online services and cloud infrastructure. Ronen led the engineering team responsible for the Windows Azure Service Bus—a cloud-based connectivity and messaging service.  He received his B.S. in Mathematics from Tel Aviv University.","23 Nov 2015","18:00","100 Avenue of Americas New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

74495,76123,4595352,"226732957","Two Amazing Talks for our November event! Talk 1: Amanda Cheung  Talk Title: Responsible Data Visualization Talk Description:  Many of us are visual learners. Charts and graphs display data in ways that benefit retention and comprehension. How can we build graphic representations of information that creates a better experience for our users? What are things we should worry about when designing and implementing data visualizations in our web applications? These graphs are innately visual, but it's our responsibility to make them accessible as well. In this talk, Amanda takes a look at how we as designers and developers can help our users understand our graphs better, easier and faster. Bio:  Amanda is the lead UX developer at DockYard, a design-driven software consultancy based out of Boston, MA. She comes from a visual background having graduated with a BFA in painting, but another part of her brain fell in love with CSS. Finding better user experience solutions by balancing designers' and developers' priorities fascinates her. She is always trying to improve the designer-developer relationship. Passionate about accessibility and CSS architecture, Amanda is also a co-organizer of the Boston CSS MeetUp and a teacher for Girl Develop It.  Talk 2: Karl Sluis Talk Title: What I Wish I Knew Two Years Ago: A Designer's Guide to D3 Talk Description: Let's face it — D3 is as powerful as it is arcane. D3 presents a steep learning curve, especially to those who are learning JavaScript as they go — like myself, a product designer by trade, an enthusiast for visualizations, and a thoroughly amateur programmer. In this talk, I'll share kernels of wisdom I've learned over the past few years, both principles and particulars. I'll discuss process, code conventions, and a few basic patterns ready to copy-paste into your own D3 project. Bio: As Senior Product Designer at Pandora’s Next Big Sound, Karl Sluis strives to unlock the unlimited power of music for musicians. His focus is on providing insights, tools, and data for all music makers, from small, independent artists, to epic international acts. Prior to joining Pandora, Karl served as an Interactive Designer at the Economist Intelligence Unit with an emphasis on data visualization. Karl has a deep passion for translating complex, rich information into friendly, usable forms.  ","23 Nov 2015","19:00","625 Avenue of Americas, 2nd Floor New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

If you can escape from the holiday party treadmill for a little bit, you are invited to join other technologists, developers, designers, and involved citizens for an Open Hack Night.  At this informal gathering, we'll meet to compare notes and get stuff done in the company of other civic hackers. There is no program, so you will have time to make progress on your own project, ask for some assistance, or see where you can be helpful to others. Attendees will also get a sneak peek at the not-yet-totally-officially-open Impact Hub Baltimore, an innovation lab, business incubator, and community center for innovators and entrepreneurs dedicated to driving positive change in Baltimore and beyond.  Hope you can join us on Monday, or at our next meetup in the new year.

Gartner predicts that $77 billion may be funneled toward cybersecurity efforts this year, expected to rise to $170 billion by 2020. This represents dramatic growth in digital security efforts over the next 5 years. Along with the increasing price tag, what are the dangers, collateral costs and remediation implications of cyber attacks for companies?  How do security providers, VARs and encryption specialists at today's highly specialized companies make security a competitive advantage versus a threat in 2016 and beyond?  As security breaches escalate, so do the many options that the government, businesses and organizations have to fight cyber-attacks. Should they outsource their security? Use their own methodology? Or automate? And where is Ascent placing its bets on what approaches may win the battle for the enterprise? The event  will focus on these questions and the $170 billion market opportunity for security companies.

During the event you will meet top-notch speakers, data scientists and data miners passionate to NoSQL and to technologies related to it. Agenda:  Disegno and Functional Programming [Shon Vick]An Italian word for fine art drawing is 'disegno'. Its meaning extends beyond the literal idea of draftsmanship. Disegno is the principle or method which underlies sculpture, as well as fine art painting and architecture. Above all, disegno constitutes the intellectual component of the visual arts, which justifies their elevation from craft to fine art, on a par with literature and music. In like manner, in the programming/software development community, a Design Pattern is a phrase used to describe a langue Franca of software construction whose principles underlies software development. Some associate this idea only with OO but does it equally well apply to FP?  Is Design just the intellectual component of the programming arts and design patterns just a lingua franca of design independent of programming language paradigm? (speech level: Intermediate; duration: 20 minutes)  Data at rest... Data in Motion [Craig Lubin] Lambda Architecture is a design pattern for building scalable and fault-tolerant data processing systems. Nathan Marz designed this generic architecture addressing common requirements for big data based on his experience working on distributed data processing systems at Twitter. This general purpose approach decomposes the problem of data analysis into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer. This allows for arbitrary queries and computations for both near real-time data as well as historical data. (speech level: intermediate; duration: 20 -25 minutes)  Riak KV and the Basho Data Platform [Alexander Sicular @siculars] In this session, we will walk through the technology landscapes involved in utilizing Riak and its integrated components  - from caching with Redis, search with Solr and analytics with Spark. We will cover the nuanced complexities of real-world environments, from dual-writer inconsistencies to eventual consistency to cache re-indexing.  You will leave with both a logical and technological view of how to architect a production-grade stack platform that leverages Riak KV as a scalable, distributed database, and integrates these toolsets in a way that runs smoothly from prototype to production. We will use the example of a product-catalogue that begins with an RDBMS backend and grows in complexity as business requirements require them to do so. By the end of the session, you will learn about system architectures, the databases involved and how to weave together the technologies necessary for today's complex applications.   (speech level: Intermediate; duration: 40 minutes)  ","09 Dec 2015","17:30","51 Melcher St. Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Consumer-friendly Airfare Prediction or How the Bunny Saves You Money Buying a plane ticket is a time-consuming and frustrating process that often leaves the consumer unhappy. Flight prices are less transparent and fluctuate more than almost anything else a consumer buys, even though airfare is one of the most expensive purchases for a typical family. Recommending when to buy is tough for two main reasons: first is the airfare marketplace and its idiosyncrasies present unique analytical challenges, and second is that the prediction must be highly consumer-friendly: both easy comprehensible and immediately actionable. If we're too conservative and tell you to buy too early, we risk missing out on a better deal later, but if we're too optimistic and wait too long, you could end up paying more as prices rise towards your departure date. Because prices change at the whim of the airlines in unpredictable ways, it's impossible to know for sure.

Consumer-friendly Airfare Prediction or How the Bunny Saves You Money Buying a plane ticket is a time-consuming and frustrating process that often leaves the consumer unhappy. Flight prices are less transparent and fluctuate more than almost anything else a consumer buys, even though airfare is one of the most expensive purchases for a typical family. Recommending when to buy is tough for two main reasons: first is the airfare marketplace and its idiosyncrasies present unique analytical challenges, and second is that the prediction must be highly consumer-friendly: both easy comprehensible and immediately actionable. If we're too conservative and tell you to buy too early, we risk missing out on a better deal later, but if we're too optimistic and wait too long, you could end up paying more as prices rise towards your departure date. Because prices change at the whim of the airlines in unpredictable ways, it's impossible to know for sure.

Wednesday 9th of December the third NoSQL night will take place in Boston at the General Assembly campus close to South Station. During the event you will meet top-notch speakers, data scientists and data miners passionate to NoSQL and to technologies related to it. Cultural Speaker: Varun is a full stack engineer coming from India as a TCS consultant who has been working in the MHE Boston office for the past year. He will share with us his perspectives on work culture differences and his experiences in both countries. In line of this the food for the event will be  then Indian American.  Agenda: Disegno and Functional Programming [Shon Vick]An Italian word for fine art drawing is 'disegno'. Its meaning extends beyond the literal idea of draftsmanship. Disegno is the principle or method which underlies sculpture, as well as fine art painting and architecture. Above all, disegno constitutes the intellectual component of the visual arts, which justifies their elevation from craft to fine art, on a par with literature and music. In like manner, in the programming/software development community, a Design Pattern is a phrase used to describe a langue Franca of software construction whose principles underlies software development. Some associate this idea only with OO but does it equally well apply to FP?  Is Design just the intellectual component of the programming arts and design patterns just a lingua franca of design independent of programming language paradigm? (speech level: Intermediate; duration: 20 minutes)   Data at rest... Data in Motion [Craig Lubin] Lambda Architecture is a design pattern for building scalable and fault-tolerant data processing systems. Nathan Marz designed this generic architecture addressing common requirements for big data based on his experience working on distributed data processing systems at Twitter. This general purpose approach decomposes the problem of data analysis into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer. This allows for arbitrary queries and computations for both near real-time data as well as historical data.(speech level: intermediate; duration: 20 -25 minutes)  Riak KV and the Basho Data Platform  [Alexander Sicular @siculars]In this session, we will walk through the technology landscapes involved in utilizing Riak and its integrated components  - from caching with Redis, search with Solr and analytics with Spark. We will cover the nuanced complexities of real-world environments, from dual-writer inconsistencies to eventual consistency to cache re-indexing.  You will leave with both a logical and technological view of how to architect a production-grade stack platform that leverages Riak KV as a scalable, distributed database, and integrates these toolsets in a way that runs smoothly from prototype to production. We will use the example of a product-catalogue that begins with an RDBMS backend and grows in complexity as business requirements require them to do so. By the end of the session, you will learn about system architectures, the databases involved and how to weave together the technologies necessary for today's complex applications.  (speech level: Intermediate; duration: 40 minutes) ","09 Dec 2015","18:30","51 Melcher St. Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Lightning Talk: ""An update on Flintrock: A faster, better spark-ec2"" - Nick Chammas In this lightning talk Nick will give a quick update on his progress with Flintrock, a hopeful successor to spark-ec2. 


Feature Talk: ""Cloud Security Monitoring and Spark Analytics"" - Andre Mesarovic, ThreatStack Andre will describe how ThreatStack uses Spark to produce roll-ups from a stream of Linux process events. An auditd-like agent installed on customers’ AWS instances sends a constant stream of kernel events to ThreatStack’s servers. These events are routed to RabbitMQ and a process writes them in batched JSON format to S3. On a fixed interval A Spark job reads the S3 objects, performs a number of aggregations and stores the results in a Postgres database. 



Feature Talk: ""Feedback Loops Between Ingest Processing &amp; Analytics"" - John Hugg, VoltDB In this talk John Hugg, Founding Engineer of VoltDB, will show how a fast data solution like VoltDB can be combined with a powerful analytic solution like Apache Spark to enable continuous and adaptable processing of events. 
The demonstration will use a click stream analysis example to demonstrate this pattern. VoltDB is used to segment and process individual clicks in real time, based on models generated from periodic batch processing. Spark, and specifically MLlib, is used to build a clustering model based on historical event data. That model is continuously run and continuously loading into VoltDB, where it can be applied to raw data. 
This continuous loop, where models or rules are generated continuously, loaded into the event processing system and applied to live data, is a powerful tool with applications in fraud detection, segmentation and engagement. This approach will be contrasted with approaches based on Storm and Spark Streaming.","10 Dec 2015","18:00","226 Causeway St. Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Abstract 1: Standardization of histology and Instrumentation are very important to the advancement of Whole Slide Imaging and to the acceptance and use of Digital Pathology in the Clinical Lab as well as in the research lab. Standardization of each step of the process in tissue, slide and image preparation and deliver within an institution, between institutions, as well as between vendors are important. The goal of the standardization in Digital Pathology is to obtain the most accurate and reliable image data as best as possible with the system we have. Then the WSIs can be effectively used for its purpose, such for diagnosis, image analysis, and so on. However the required quality for different situation is not the same. Since there are various equipment available, each with its own specifications and price tags, we need to have our own standard definition of what quality means to reach the goal. Our standard definition of quality can be decided through the evaluation of these 6 major criteria: slide quality, image quality, stain, color, human interface, and network. In this talk, topics related to image quality and color will be focused on.

Join Benjamin Brown from Akamai and Will Lefevers of Constant Contact as they dig into anonymization networks and cybercrime.  GRAB A TICKET!  What are Anonymization Networks (Tor) and How do they Work? Will will be presenting a technical overview of anonymization networks, how they work, and this whole ""Darknet"" thing everyone keeps talking about. Examples will be based on the most popular anonymization network today, Tor. Like any good security talk, design and implementation flaws will be discussed, as well as established techniques for de-anonymizing users and sites.   About Will Lefevers: Will Lefevers is the Lead Information  Sec urity Architect for Constant Contact. His 15 years of InfoSec experience includes military tours in satellite operations, counterintelligence, cyber operations, and vulnerability research. His foci include insider threat detection, behavioral analysis, malware reverse-engineering, and hunting threat actors in live networks. He’s also an avid homebrewer and writes exceptionally mediocre code.  Cashing out in Cybercrime The hardest part of cybercrime is the cashout. The strategy for cashing out needs to be easy enough to make it worth your while and safe enough to stay out of the klink. With more and more focus on identifying and stopping credit card fraud cybercrooks are diversifying their methods for cashing out. While criminals can, and do, sell whole and bundled online retailer accounts, credit card data, and fullz, I want to look at how they get their grubby paws on that cold hard cash. Lets dig into the tools, techniques, and procedures used by this new generation of e-launderers and cyber hustlers. Understanding the lifecycle of a financially motivated cybercrime is an important part of successfully and efficiently defending against them. When we have insight into the tools, techniques, procedures, motivations, methods, and ecosystems driving these attacks we are afforded the opportunity to build defense in depth that specifically targets the weaknesses and load-bearing assumptions of the attackers.  About Benjamin Brown: Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies. He has experience in the non-profit, academic, and corporate worlds as well as degrees in both Anthropology and International Studies. Research interests include novel and side-channel attack vectors, radio systems, the psychology and anthropology of information security, metacognitive techniques, threat actor profiling, intelligence analysis, and thinking about security as an ecology of complex systems.","17 Dec 2015","18:00","217 Commonwealth Avenue Boston",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Urban data opens up many new opportunities to improve cities and people’s lives. In NYC, by integrating and analyzing data sets from multiple city agencies, the Bloomberg administration was able improve the success rate of inspections. A marked reduction in crime both in New York and Los Angeles has been in part attributed to data-driven policing. Policy changes have also been triggered by data-driven studies that, for example, showed correlations between foreclosures and increase in crime, the effects of subsidized housing on surrounding neighborhoods, and how low income households use the flexibility provided by vouchers to reach neighborhoods with high performing schools. But in each of these successes, the level of effort required to gather, integrate, analyze the relevant data, design and refine models, or develop and deploy apps, is staggering. Further as data volumes and data complexity continue to explode, these problems are only getting worse. In this talk, we will provide an overview of research in the development of new methods and systems for enabling interdisciplinary teams to better understand cities. We will also show some applications of our work.  Bio:  Cláudio Silva is a professor of computer science and engineering and data science at New York University. Claudio’s research lies in the intersection of visualization, data analysis, and geometric computing, and recently he has been interested in the analysis of urban data and sports analytics. He has published over 220 journal and conference papers and is an inventor of 12 US patents. His work received over 10,000 citations according to Google Scholar and an h-index of 50. Cláudio has served on the editorial boards of several journals, including IEEE Transactions on Big Data, ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems, Computer Graphics Forum, The Visual Computer, Graphical Models, Computer and Graphics, Computing in Science and Engineering, and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. He helped developed a number of award-winning software systems, most recently Major League Baseball (MLB) MLB.com's Statcast player tracking system. He is an IEEE Fellow and was the recipient of the 2014 IEEE VGTC Visualization Technical Achievement Award “in recognition of seminal advances in geometric computing for visualization and for contributions to the development of the VisTrails data exploration system.” He is currently Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics.","07 Dec 2015","11:00","33 Thomas Street New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

1st PITCH LIFE SCIENCE “EAVESDROPPING ON INVESTORS CLOSED DOOR DISCUSSIONS” 


December 7th, 2015 5:30PM – 8:30PM 


Hear what happens AFTER a start-up company presents to an investor group! Usually after the company representatives leave the room, the investors have a private discussion to decide whether  the opportunity merits further investigation and possible investment.  1st Pitch Life Science offers presenters and audience members the chance to hear what happens in those closed-door discussions, and to learn what really matters to investors. 1st Pitch Life Science is organized by MABA (Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (www.bioangels.net), a life science investor group, to encourage and educate aspiring life science entrepreneurs who know they may be too early to seek investment but want the opportunity to practice their pitch and to receive constructive criticism from experienced and knowledgeable professionals. Presenting at 1st Pitch Life Science allows early stage life science entrepreneurs to: Try out a pitch where no money is immediately at stake. Hear what investors and audience members think of their presentation and opportunity Receive early, constructive feedback from knowledgeable and experienced industry people (including representatives from Mid Atlantic Bio Angels) Potentially connect with advisors/mentors and other team members who may be interested in supporting the company’s efforts and adding value at an early stage 


Audience members get to hear how entrepreneurs are pursuing new science and new business opportunities and to provide their own feedback regarding the value and effectiveness of those efforts.  The audience  votes on a “Best in Show” company which will advance to an annual “Best of the Best” competition. There is no downside – no investor rejection, no lost opportunities.  Just good advice and potential connections that a company can use to improve its strategy and presentation. Also, note our new ""Looking For"" section on the registration.  Let us know what your startup is looking for - software engineer, patent attorney, formulator, certain type of CRO, management, etc - and we will provide you with a different-color name badge with this information printed on it so that others can easily tell you are looking for something and help you make meaningful connections for your company!

Hadoop has been the front leader for the last decade and has given us many tools to lean on for the “Big Data” processing. Spark is the new kid on the block and its quickly proliferating the ecosystem. Whats not to like about Spark? It’s fast, scalable and can process both streaming and batch workloads. Coupled together with Amazon Web Services, it can be a very potent combination.  Learn first hand what it takes to deploy Spark and Yarn on AWS and how to take advantage of Spot instance to take advantage of the cloud’s elasticity and reduce your operating costs. Presenter: Alex Rovner Alex Rovner is the Director of Data Engineering at Magnetic. He has a long history of using Hadoop and other open source projects within it’s ecosystem.

DESCRIPTION During the analysis process ample attention is given to data visualization though the same care is usually lacking when it comes time to understand statistical models.  The best analysis is lost if its meaning cannot be conveyed easily and concisely.  Far too often a model is rendered as a table of hard-to-decipher numbers.  We look at techniques for model visualization that allow for a quick understanding of the results. ","07 Dec 2015","18:30","27 East 28th Street, 3rd Floor New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

(Need To Arrive By 7:10) For the next 2 Tuesdays, the Think Tank will be meeting at a bar a few doors down from our normal meeting place.  I've been assembling a pretty cool program for the next 12 months that I think you guys will really enjoy - but I'd like to get your feedback on it before we enter the New Year. We'll grab a booth and talk about the plan, upcoming tech, big challenges, and ways you can actually start building products. One of the things I need help with is zooming in on topics. I've kicked off a brief Trello board that will develop over the coming 30 days. I'd love for you to contribute ideas that are on your mind (include background links whenever possible): Open The Trello Board &gt;&gt;&gt; So let's grab some beer (there are *supposedly* over 100 on tap at this place... we shall see...) and dive into what's up and coming over the next 12 months. Can't wait. Cheers! Dan  PS - I'm also kicking off a search for a co-organizer who can handle at least one event per month. The group is continuing to grow so I want to make sure we maintain as consistent of a schedule as possible - as you can tell, I'm not always in town!

Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud KEYNOTE SPEAKER:   


Brett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco Brett Rudenstein has an extensive background in Application Lifecycle Management, High Performance Computing and Open Source Software Analysis. He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria, IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop. ---------------- Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.  The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:  - An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss - A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing - A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.  This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”  Big SQL 4.1. Presenters:   Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM  Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.  With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.  PARKING Street parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free.  Check the signs so as not to get booted!  Garage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch.  They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours. ","09 Dec 2015","17:30","286 Washington St Jersey City",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Evan is Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Meetup.com, where he works on recommendations and other large-scale data problems.  When Recommendation Systems Go Bad Machine learning and recommendations systems have changed the way we interact with not just the internet, but some of the basic products and services that we use to organize and run our life. As the people that build these systems, we have a social responsibility to consider how these systems affect people, and furthermore, we should do whatever we can to prevent these systems and models from perpetuating some of the prejudice and bias that exist in our society today.  In this talk I intend to cover some of the recommendation systems that have gone wrong across various industries, and attempt to provide some solutions for prevention. First and foremost among these is awareness, but approaches involving interpretable models, using ensemble models to separate features that shouldn't interact, and designing test data sets for capturing bias will also be explored.

In other words, we attempt to place ads in a way that will maximize their click-through rates or conversion rates. In order to bid on auctions for online ad placement in real time, we need to estimate the click or conversion probabilities to determine how much to bid. Most predictive models produce scores which indicate event ranks rather than event probabilities. This paper describes the calibration algorithm - Monotonically Increasing Multi-Interval Continuous Calibration - that we developed to convert the model scores to probability estimates. Speaker Bio: Sam Steingold has been doing data science since before it got that swanky name.

I argue that the traditional ""counting"" metrics are confusing and misleading, cannot detect poor predictors, and are only applicable in limited settings. Information Theory provides a high-level universal view on the problem and supplies a discriminating transparent performance metric.

Join us January 6 when Robin Hanson previews The Age of Em. His upcoming book and research unveil a world run by robots. Not a science fiction novel, he envisions every aspect of our lives influenced by the spread of robots from the workplace and life extension to personal relationships. His insights on employment challenges are especially noteworthy. Robin will devote extra time for Q&amp;A, due to the subject’s depth and his varied interests (as below). Doors open at 6:30pm.   About Robin in his words:  I am interested in all aspects of the future, including uploading, nanotech,  hypertext publishing, cosmology and the foundations of physics, future economic growth rates, limits of computation, and the origin of life. I'd love to specialize in the economics of science fiction. Some fun places to discuss such issues are the Polymath and the Extropians mailing list which I have participated in since 1991.

In his current role he is responsible for overseeing WANdisco's product strategy. In his previous role as a founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Librados, an application integration software provider, Jim was responsible for overall product strategy and product messaging.  He was also a member of the management team that led the company’s acquisition by NetManage, Inc. Following its acquisition, Jim joined NetManage as CTO for the Librados products group.  Prior to Librados, he was the vice president of product management for Insevo, a middleware company specializing in enterprise application integration. Jim also held senior product management, product marketing and consulting management positions at BEA Systems and SAP AG.   - Big SQL - Making all of your big data SQL accessible using an optimal execution strategy.  Presenters:Rick Tarro, Jeffrey Carlson - IBM Analytics Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.  The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:  - An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss - A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing - A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.  This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”   Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance.

Abstract: Statistics and machine learning are part of many new systems, but have been described as the “high interest credit card of technical debt.” Is it possible to make statistical inference broadly accessible to non-statistician programmers without sacrificing mathematical rigor or inference quality? BayesDB is a system that enables users to query the probably implications of their data as directly as SQL enables them to query the data itself. BayesDB abstracts away model-specific details of statistical inference by providing a declarative query language, BQL. The Bayesian Query Language extends SQL and provides queries for Bayesian data analysis that are answered by averaging over an implicit space of probabilistic models. BayesDB provides a machine-assisted modeling language, MML, that enables domain experts to specify qualitative constraints and produces baseline models that are suitable for data cleaning, anomaly detection, variable selection, and a broad class of prediction tasks. BayesDB also provides an extensible interface for plugging in statistical and algorithmic models and composing multiple kinds of models into a single population. This presentation focuses on the applications of BayesDB to analyzing and understanding developmental economics data in collaboration with the Gates Foundation.

This infant technology could change the financial system; think the Internet before browsers. It could reduce the cost and increase in the speed and accuracy of financial transactions; it could truly disrupt the banking business. Or it could fizzle. But already it is raising a host of policy questions – about financial stability, consumer protection, choking off terrorists' finances, and tensions between established and upstart financial institutions and between regulatory agencies. On January 14, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will explore the future of distributed ledger technology, paying special attention to the innovation’s impact on financial services and policymaking. Hutchins Center director David Wessel will convene leading industry and policy experts for a panel discussion. After the session, panelists will take audience questions.

He writes about the post-industrial revolution, the way ideas spread, marketing, quitting, leadership and most of all, changing everything. You might be familiar with his books Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip and Purple Cow. In addition to his writing and speaking, Seth founded both Yoyodyne and Squidoo. His blog (which you can find by typing ""seth"" into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. He was recently inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame, one of three chosen for this honor in 2013. Recently, Godin once again set the book publishing industry on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal after three hours and ended up becoming the most successful book project ever done this way. His newest book, What To Do When It's Your Turn, is already a bestseller. To Secure Your Spot Register Here About the Event:  By: Seth Godin &amp; Do You Zoom, Inc. This is a new way to learn, designed for people who seek to make a difference. A live online course that students do together, guided by pre-recorded video... using real-time writing and interaction to create change and connection. A three-hour intensive workshop, with all participants in sync. Start together, finish together, interact. Like the altMBA, we run this workshop in a private, customized Slack room. But this workshop lasts just three hours, and it's a sprint. Some learning doesn’t easily come from a mere lecture. It comes from engagement. Engagement with others, fellow students, people on the same path as you. And even more important, from self awareness, from writing and speaking about what matters, what you see and what you are capable of. This intensive workshop is designed to explore what it means to be a leader, and more important, what it means for you to be a leader. It's designed for anyone who has ever sought to make a difference. For entrepreneurs, middle managers, parents and everyone who has ever needed to stand up and say, ""follow me."" There is just over thirty minutes of original video, but far more important are the 120 minutes you will spend on doing the work, writing and connecting. Connecting not only with the video, but with the other students in the course. Most online courses are done solo, on your own time. This three-hour workshop is different. Here's how it works:  As the workshop unfolds, there are nine sections on various facets of leadership. First, each section starts off with a video which I've recorded specifically for this course, dropped into the Slack room. Next, there is an exercise or discussion prompt for you to work on with your group in Slack. You'll answer the question and work on your own writing. Finally, you'll come together with other participants in Slack to engage on what you've learned via live chat. The sections: - Leadership is not management - See the end before you begin the journey - Culture defeats everything - Selling the dream - Enrollment - Don’t forget rule 6 - Authority vs. responsibility - Certain failure - It’s personal After the session is over, you will have a written record of the transformation you’ve caused in yourself and in others. 100% of our revenue is going to Acumen to help them create more courses for social entrepreneurs and those hoping to make an impact. We're looking forward to engaging with you. PLEASE NOTE! You will get a further instructions on the confirmation page after purchasing a ticket. You'll also get an invite to the Slack room, from Slack, the morning of the event. Please check your spam folder... you'll need the link to access the course.

Please join us for a conference call featuring four thought leaders on the current state and future direction of the Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality ecosystem.   Click here to get the slides for the call (on January 19th)  Virtual reality is having a moment.  CNBC wrote earlier this week: "" Welcome to the Future: Virtual reality at CES ""  According to a December 22nd research report by Jefferies, 2016 is poised to be a “watershed” year with the launch of three VR platforms in the first half of the year (Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony VR, and HTC Vive).  Jefferies believes the launches will be “more successful than investors anticipate”.  But even investors that believe that AR/VR is the next big thing should remember Amara’s Law: “We tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run”.   So what does 2016 hold for the world of AR/VR?   Will we see massive consumer adoption, or are predictions more hype than substance?   What are the potential killer apps?   What platforms are poised for success?   What industries are ripe for disruption?  These questions and more will be addressed by our panel of AR/VR experts.   Note: The content of this broadcast/ presentation does not involve the rendering of personalized investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell the securities mentioned herein it is for and is for informational or discussion purposes only.

But too often, the deliverable output is unread reports, spreadsheets or dashboards, which leaves the valuable insights unused, and underachieves the team's potential. Dr. LaGatta's talk will emphasize the role of operationalizing this data science output. The idea here is that data scientists do work exploring the data &amp; building models, then once these models are productionized, they deliver their insights to analysts via a simple review dashboard, or via existing ticketing systems &amp; workflows. The output of this review is then saved in state, and used as input for further models to reduce false positives &amp; optimize for meaningful results. This methodology has relevance for Network Operations Centers, Security Operations Centers, Business Operations Centers, and more. By aligning their output with operational workflows, data scientists generate value across the org, and guarantee success for their teams.","19 Jan 2016","18:30","101 Arch Street 8th Floor Boston",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

During this final MBCI meeting, we will look at recent elections and the upcoming 2016 election to understand the foundations and benefits of an Competitive Intelligence Early Warning System. By looking at the process by which political campaigns and ads are developed, executives will see similarities in their own business situation.  We will view the different strategies campaigns take to collect, analyze and disseminate ‘oppo’ research.  Finally, we will illustrate the benefits of an Early Warning System with real world examples (both political and non-political.)  6:00-6:15 Networking6:15-7:15 Presentation7:15-8:00 Discussion We are pleased to welcome Ed Payne as our speaker. Ed is the Principal of The CI Collaborative, LLC., a Competitive Intelligence Consultancy based on the North Shore.  He has over 20 years of experience working with clients in various industries, including consumer goods, hospitality, biotechnology, life sciences, business  services, and chemicals.  His current work is helping clients develop their own CI functions including SWOT analysis, Go to Market Strategy Development, Scenario planning, War Gaming and CI Process consulting. Ed started his career in politics developing opposition briefings for US Senate candidates.  After leaving politics, Ed moved on to develop two early warning systems, one in staffing (Cross Country Staffing) and another in IT consultancy (Giga Information Group).  Most recently, Ed was a Director with Fuld + Company, a pioneer in competitive intelligence consulting.

We apologize for the late change, but we can still have Maptime! The FOSS4G conference is coming to Boston in 2017, and soon the planning committee will be holding a logo design contest. Mike will update us on what's happening with FOSS4G, and then let's try our hand at some mappy graphic design and make some logos. In the process we'll get a little acquainted with some vector and raster graphic design software, a very important part of almost every cartographer's toolkit. You will probably want to download some software ahead of time. These are some of the common tools: • Adobe Illustrator (vector) and Photoshop (raster). Sadly, these cost a lot of money, but they are the industry standards. It's worth downloading free trials and poking around. • Inkscape (vector) and GIMP (raster). The free open-source alternatives to Illustrator and Photoshop. Please note that we are in a different location this month, Harvard's CGIS Knafel North Room K050 - 1737 Cambridge St. near Harvard Square. We'll also be starting at 6:30PM. We're hoping to move back to our regular location/time starting next month. 



-------- Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies. This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time. Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together? Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!","20 Jan 2016","18:30","1737 cambridge street, Room K050 cambridge",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

The promise of the Internet of Things is WHAT we do with all this time series-based telemetric and contextual data. In this talk, Sean will take a peek under the hood with where predictive analytics is heading with regards to adaptive analyzing time series data in real-time. We’ll be looking at deep learning, more specifically recurrent neural networks, and how they are about to bring environmental awareness to our connected lives.

It was a nice-to-have, after identifying a customer need and fulfilling it with a working product. The product had to work and it had to ship. If it was a great experience, well all the better. Times have changed. The cost of creating and delivering a product is no longer a barrier to entry. Quality is no longer a differentiator. What's left? The experience of using the product. If you're going to be truly competitive in today's markets, your products and services better have a great experience. To do that, a fundamental shift has to occur inside your organization. It's no longer acceptable to ship a product with a poor experience or to deliver poor customer service. Every part of the organization has to be infused with an understanding of great user experience. Your organization has to cross the UX Tipping Point.  BIOJared M. Spool is the founder of User Interface Engineering and a co-founder of Center Centre. If you've ever seen Jared speak about user experience design, you know that he's probably the most effective and knowledgeable communicator on the subject today. He's been working in the field of usability and experience design since 1978, before the term ""usability"" was ever associated with computers.  Jared spends his time working with the research teams at User Interface Engineering, helps clients understand how to solve their design problems, explains to reporters and industry analysts what the current state of design is all about, and is a top-rated speaker at more than 20 conferences every year. With Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman, he is starting Center Centre, a new school in Chattanooga, TN, to create the next generation of industry-ready UX Designers. In 2014, the school, under the nickname of the Unicorn Institute, launched a Kickstarter project that successfully raised more that 600% of its initial goal. He is also the conference chair and keynote speaker at the annual UI Conference and UX Immersion Conference, and manages to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time. He is author of the book, Web Usability: A Designer's Guide and co-author of Web Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks that Work. You can find his writing at uie.com and follow his adventures on the twitters at @jmspool. VENUEThe meeting will be held in the new meeting auditorium at the Verizon Technology Center.

My research focuses on leveraging SLAM-aware robots to better inform scene semantics including object recognition. I'll discuss a recent result in SLAM-supported object recognition that improves monocular object recognition performance over existing frame-based techniques. Inherent to the spatial and semantic understanding is the choice of map representation. I'll discuss new map representations in the context of visual SLAM, and shall show some very recent results of an application involving high-speed map reconstructions using stereo cameras.

This talk will touch on a number of challenges which arise in this environment: 1) high volume data streams of around 30 Billion daily consumer touch points, 2) low latency requirements on scoring and automated bidding decisioning within 100ms and 3) adversarial modeling in the light of advertising fraud and bots.  Specifically, we will discuss an automated learning system implemented at Dstillery, that uses privacy friendly data representation to build sparse targeting models for thousands of products in Millions of dimensions. The solution incorporates ideas from transfer learning, Bayesian priors, stochastic gradient descent, hashing and learning rate estimation. On the sidelines, but of no less importance, are topics on bid optimization, data reliability, cross-device identification and observational methods for causal inference. Finally, I will touch on a few higher-level lessons around incentive misalignments/measurement issues in the advertising industry and measuring causality on observational data. Bio:  Claudia Perlich leads the machine learning efforts that power Dstillery’s digital intelligence for marketers and media companies.  With more than 50 published scientific articles, she is a widely acclaimed expert on big data and machine learning applications, and an active speaker at data science and marketing conferences around the world. Claudia is the past winner of the Advertising Research Foundation’s (ARF) Grand Innovation Award and has been selected for Crain’s New York’s 40 Under 40 list, Wired Magazine’s Smart List, and Fast Company’s 100 Most Creative People. Claudia holds multiple patents in machine learning.  She has won many data mining competitions and awards at Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conferences, and served as the organization’s General Chair in 2014. Prior to joining Dstillery in 2010, Claudia worked at IBM’s Watson Research Center, focusing on data analytics and machine learning.  She holds a PhD in Information Systems from New York University (where she continues to teach at the Stern School of Business), and an MA in Computer Science from the University of Colorado.","11 Jan 2016","10:30","33 Thomas Street New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

95057,117680,18334914,"227962523"," Welcome to 2016! For our first event of the year, Mike Benjamin will be leading a discussion around medical diagnosis and the principles of Occam's Razor.  We have several new announcements to make at this event for our 2016 calendar and event format, so don't miss out!  Without further ado, here's Mike! Event Description As medical diagnostic tools advance technologically, more and more data is available to physicians to theoretically make more accurate and timely diagnoses. The problem is the increased complexity that comes with greater access to this data. Historically diagnostic medicine’s most important tool has been the “History of Present Illness (HPI)"", the interview with the patient of symptoms. (See below for description.) This interview is still important to decide what tests to do, but even with these tests, there is still the problem of integrating and analyzing all of the information in a logical process and come up with an accurate diagnosis.  This is getting even more complex as we have more tools which provide more data on each patient, making it more difficult for physicians to benefit form the advancing technology. I would even say, based on my own experience, that the diagnostic process becomes more difficult and physicians, overwhelmed with data fallback to oversimplification of the diagnosis and miss important correlations. (Occam’s Razor vs. Hickam’s Dictum) How do we address these increasing complexities. What technological solutions can we come up with to integrate and order this information to allow physicians to make more accurate and timely diagnoses? (i.e. AI, Data Informatics, etc.) A Brief History of Present Illness (HPI): It is also common wisdom in medical education that the most powerful diagnostic information is the patient interview, specifically the History of Present Illness (HPI).  The HPI is the portion of the patient’s story of illness in which the patient tells the symptoms, time frame, relationship of the various symptoms, and his or her interpretation of them. The physician’s task in this portion of the interview is to understand the patient’s story in the context of the nonverbal clues for such things as anxiety, anger, or depression that are also present.  The physician must facilitate a story from a patient experiencing one of these uncomfortable emotions. This cumulative task requires enormous skill, which is not encouraged in much of the curricula of medical school. Many studies in the medical education literature report that medical students become worse at these tasks as medical school progresses.  If the doctor can successfully obtain the story (HPI) in a rational sequence, and put it together appropriately, he or she must then apply a rigorous logic to this information in order to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Without a sense of this logic, problems leading to improper diagnoses can — and often do — attend the HPI.” Relationship to Occam’s Razor In medical terms it is often translated into the law of diagnostic parsimony – to try to come up with a ‘unifying’ diagnosis that can explain all the patient’s problems (i.e. to invoke Occam’s Razor) Diagnostic parsimony advocates that when diagnosing a given injury, ailment, illness, or disease a doctor should strive to look for the fewest possible causes that will account for all the symptoms. Hickam’s Dictum The actual process that occurs when diagnosing a patient is a continuous flow of hypothesis and testing of that hypothesis, then modifying the hypothesis, and so on…In the context of this method, the principle of Hickam’s dictum asserts that at no stage should a particular diagnosis be excluded solely because it doesn’t appear to fit the principle of Occam’s razor.

This meeting, we'll cover section 3.3 - 3.5 of Pearl's Causality!  These sections cover, among other things, the back-door criterion!  This is a criterion for (given a causal model) selecting a subset of variables to ""control for"" to remove confounding bias when you're estimating causal effects.  It turns out that sometimes, adding variables can actually introduce bias (i.e. conditioning on descendants of the effect).   Do read the material before the meeting, but it's okay if you don't understand all of it! If you get stuck somewhere, make a note of where. It's likely others got stuck in the same place! Try to push through and understand as much of the rest of the material as possible. We'll try to get everyone on the same page at the meeting! We're an extremely informal group, and the format is generally to put the book up on a screen, and talk through the material. We stop and discuss sticking points (your notes!) throughout, and dwell on definitions and theorems. You can also ask any questions about the material in our piazza course page, using the access code stats101 ! -- and it supports latex! http://piazza.com/nyc_ml_study_group/fall2015/stats101  Recommended Pre-requisites: • Probability Theory (intermediate): Know what a joint and conditional distribution is. Know what marginalizing is. Understand conditional independence. • Causality up to Sec. 3.2.  • Graphical Models (intermediate): Know how to factorize a graph. Understand what it means for a distribution P to be ""Markov relative to"" a graph G. Understand what a ""Causal Model"" is.  • Analysis (intermediate): Be comfortable with product (big Pi) notation, indices, basic methods of proofs, basics of set theory, analysis notation (e.g. the funny e thing for ""is an element of"") Logistical Notes: • Be sure to be on time! If you're more than 15 minutes late, you may have trouble getting in. • The receptionist may be not downstairs with the guest list promptly at 6:00. If you arrive and the security desk is unaware of the meetup, just hang out until she arrives downstairs to check you in! • Be sure to bring ID for security! • There will be signs upstairs (""Math Meetup"") directing you to the room.","13 Jan 2016","18:30","200 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor New York",6,"will, event, well, new, network, get, come, nyc, workshop, drink"

When: Thursday, January 14, 2016, 1:15  – 3:00 PM EST  What:  Bitcoin, the digital currency, has attracted both attention and controversy. But the most potent innovation is not the currency itself. Rather, it’s the technology that undergirds bitcoin, the distributed-ledger technology known as the blockchain that allows payments to flow through an economy in an entirely decentralized way—without banks or other intermediaries. This infant technology could change the financial system; think the Internet before browsers. It could reduce the cost and increase in the speed and accuracy of financial transactions; it could truly disrupt the banking business. Or it could fizzle. But already it is raising a host of policy questions – about financial stability, consumer protection, choking off terrorists' finances, and tensions between established and upstart financial institutions and between regulatory agencies. On January 14, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will explore the future of distributed ledger technology, paying special attention to the innovation’s impact on financial services and policymaking. Hutchins Center director David Wessel will convene leading industry and policy experts for a panel discussion. After the session, panelists will take audience questions. You can join the conversation and tweet questions for the panelists at #BeyondBitcoin.

To be held at Bank of America's office in the World Financial Center. We have two really exciting talks this month, from Typesafe's Duncan DeVore and Petr Zapletal from Cake Solutions  **NOTE: This is hosted in a secure building, you will need photo id to enter and your meetup name will need to match your id**  Reactive Monitoring with Duncan DeVore Reactive theory provides us with the means by which we can create modern distributed systems in a palatable way by hiding the complexities of asynchronous boundaries, resilience and elasticity. As a result, we can deliver powerful systems that self-heal and flex under load, but face a new challenge. How do we know our application is working as expected? Why Reactive Monitoring of course! In this session, we will cover the principles behind Reactive theory and discuss how Reactive Monitoring provides the insight needed for a healthy Reactive application. About Duncan  Duncan DeVore is co-author of ""Reactive Application Development"", Senior Software Engineer on the Monitoring team at Typesafe, open source developer and frequent speaker. He has been an avid Scala developer since 2009, holds two patents for software design and led the release of one of the first large-scale Reactive applications in 2012.

Distributed Real-Time Stream Processing: Why and How with Petr Zapletal  In this talk you will discover various state of the art open-source distributed streaming frameworks, their similarities and differences, implementation trade-offs, their intended use-cases and how to choose between them. Petr will focus on the popular frameworks including Spark Streaming, Storm, Samza and Flink. In addition, you will also explore theoretical introduction, common pitfalls, popular architectures and many more. The demand for stream processing is increasing. Immense amounts of data has to be processed fast from a rapidly growing set of disparate data sources. This pushes the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include trading, social networks, Internet of things or system monitoring, are becoming more and more important. A number of powerful, easy-to-use open source platforms have emerged to address this. Petr's goal is to provide comprehensive overview about modern streaming solutions and to help fellow developers with picking the best possible decision for their particular use-case. Join this talk if you are thinking about, implementing or have already deployed streaming solution. About Petr  Petr is a Software Engineer who specialises in the design and implementation of highly scaleable, reactive and resilient distributed systems. He is a functional programming and open source evangelist and has expertise in the area of big data and machine classification techniques. Petr participates in the whole software delivery lifecycle; from requirement analysis &amp; design, through to maintaining systems in production. During his career Petr has worked for various companies from start-ups, to large international corporations.","14 Jan 2016","18:30","250 Vesey Street New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

96221,110364,19170949,"227965818"," About Seth Godin: SETH GODIN is the author of 18 books that have been bestsellers around the world and have been translated into more than 35 languages. He writes about the post-industrial revolution, the way ideas spread, marketing, quitting, leadership and most of all, changing everything. You might be familiar with his books Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip and Purple Cow. In addition to his writing and speaking, Seth founded both Yoyodyne and Squidoo. His blog (which you can find by typing ""seth"" into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. He was recently inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame, one of three chosen for this honor in 2013. Recently, Godin once again set the book publishing industry on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal after three hours and ended up becoming the most successful book project ever done this way. His newest book, What To Do When It's Your Turn, is already a bestseller. To Secure Your Spot Register Here About the Event:  By: Seth Godin &amp; Do You Zoom, Inc. This is a new way to learn, designed for people who seek to make a difference. A live online course that students do together, guided by pre-recorded video... using real-time writing and interaction to create change and connection. A three-hour intensive workshop, with all participants in sync. Start together, finish together, interact. Like the altMBA, we run this workshop in a private, customized Slack room. But this workshop lasts just three hours, and it's a sprint. Some learning doesn’t easily come from a mere lecture. It comes from engagement. Engagement with others, fellow students, people on the same path as you. And even more important, from self awareness, from writing and speaking about what matters, what you see and what you are capable of. This intensive workshop is designed to explore what it means to be a leader, and more important, what it means for you to be a leader. It's designed for anyone who has ever sought to make a difference. For entrepreneurs, middle managers, parents and everyone who has ever needed to stand up and say, ""follow me."" There is just over thirty minutes of original video, but far more important are the 120 minutes you will spend on doing the work, writing and connecting. Connecting not only with the video, but with the other students in the course. Most online courses are done solo, on your own time. This three-hour workshop is different. Here's how it works:  As the workshop unfolds, there are nine sections on various facets of leadership. First, each section starts off with a video which I've recorded specifically for this course, dropped into the Slack room. Next, there is an exercise or discussion prompt for you to work on with your group in Slack. You'll answer the question and work on your own writing. Finally, you'll come together with other participants in Slack to engage on what you've learned via live chat. The sections: - Leadership is not management - See the end before you begin the journey - Culture defeats everything - Selling the dream - Enrollment - Don’t forget rule 6 - Authority vs. responsibility - Certain failure - It’s personal After the session is over, you will have a written record of the transformation you’ve caused in yourself and in others. 100% of our revenue is going to Acumen to help them create more courses for social entrepreneurs and those hoping to make an impact. We're looking forward to engaging with you. PLEASE NOTE! You will get a further instructions on the confirmation page after purchasing a ticket. You'll also get an invite to the Slack room, from Slack, the morning of the event. Please check your spam folder... you'll need the link to access the course.

When: Tuesday, January 19th, 1:00PM-2:00PM EST Where: Conference Call - Email [masked] for Dial In Information. Please join us for a conference call featuring four thought leaders on the current state and future direction of the Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality ecosystem.   Click here to get the slides for the call (on January 19th)  Virtual reality is having a moment.  CNBC wrote earlier this week: "" Welcome to the Future: Virtual reality at CES ""  According to a December 22nd research report by Jefferies, 2016 is poised to be a “watershed” year with the launch of three VR platforms in the first half of the year (Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony VR, and HTC Vive).  Jefferies believes the launches will be “more successful than investors anticipate”.  But even investors that believe that AR/VR is the next big thing should remember Amara’s Law: “We tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run”.   So what does 2016 hold for the world of AR/VR?   Will we see massive consumer adoption, or are predictions more hype than substance?   What are the potential killer apps?   What platforms are poised for success?   What industries are ripe for disruption?  These questions and more will be addressed by our panel of AR/VR experts.   Note: The content of this broadcast/ presentation does not involve the rendering of personalized investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell the securities mentioned herein it is for and is for informational or discussion purposes only.

About the talk: Personal computers are really powerful: more than powerful enough to analyze the full dataset of every NYC taxi trip from 2009 to 2015—over 1.1 billion trips! I'll go over my recent work analyzing the full taxi dataset using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and R, and discuss some underlying tips and techniques that I've found helpful for analyzing medium-sized datasets. It's not always clear what constitutes ""small"", ""medium"", or ""big"" data, but for the purposes of this talk, I'll consider medium data to mean ""a few hundred gigabytes""—small enough to fit on your local hard disk, but big enough that you have to plan ahead and act deliberately if you want to extract meaningful insights within a reasonable amount of time. About Todd: Todd Schneider writes software at Genius. Before that, he spent six years building statistical models to value mortgage-backed securities at Ellington Management Group, and before that he studied applied math and electrical engineering at Yale. His interests beyond data/math/computers include golf, prediction markets, and action movies. He writes at toddwschneider.com.

Speaker:Yann LeCun, Facebook AI Research &amp; New York University Description: Deep Learning has revolutionized computer vision and speech recognition, and is well on its way to profoundly transform natural language understanding. The main advantage of deep learning is that it automates the process of designing good features for a machine learning system. Yann will review the basic ideas and methods of deep learning and describe a number of large-scale practical applications in image understanding and natural language understanding. Beyond traditional ML applications, the long-term goal of deep learning is to enable progress towards AI systems. Yann will talk about some of the challenges on the path to AI. Bio of speaker: Yann LeCun is Director of AI Research at Facebook, and Silver Professor of Data Science, Computer Science, Neural Science, and Electrical Engineering at New York University, affiliated with the NYU Center for Data Science, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, the Center for Neural Science, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.  He received the Electrical Engineer Diploma from Ecole Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Electrotechnique et Electronique (ESIEE), Paris in 1983, and a PhD in Computer Science from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) in 1987. After a postdoc at the University of Toronto, he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, NJ in 1988. He became head of the Image Processing Research Department at AT&amp;T Labs-Research in 1996, and joined NYU as a professor in 2003, after a brief period as a Fellow of the NEC Research Institute in Princeton. From 2012 to 2014 he directed NYU's initiative in data science and became the founding director of the NYU Center for Data Science. He was named Director of AI Research at Facebook in late 2013 and retains a part-time position on the NYU faculty.  His current interests include AI, machine learning, computer perception, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. He has published over 180 technical papers and book chapters on these topics as well as on neural networks, handwriting recognition, image processing and compression, and on dedicated circuits and architectures for computer perception. The character recognition technology he developed at Bell Labs is used by several banks around the world to read checks and was reading between 10 and 20% of all the checks in the US in the early 2000s. His image compression technology, called DjVu, is used by hundreds of web sites and publishers and millions of users to access scanned documents on the Web. Since the mid 1980's he has been working on deep learning methods, particularly the convolutional network model, which is the basis of many products and services deployed by companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM, NEC, AT&amp;T and others for image and video understanding, document recognition, human-computer interaction, and speech recognition.  LeCun has been on the editorial board of IJCV, IEEE PAMI, and IEEE Trans. Neural Networks, was program chair of CVPR'06, and is chair of ICLR 2013 and 2014. He is on the science advisory board of Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He has advised many large and small companies about machine learning technology, including several startups he co-founded. He is the lead faculty at NYU for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment, a $36M initiative in collaboration with UC Berkeley and University of Washington to develop data-driven methods in the sciences.

1) Making a living as an independent FileMaker developer Michael Reade of Saci Solutions, will lead a round-table discussion about making a living as an independent FileMaker developer. Topics include: how to market yourself; how to pitch developing a custom solution using FileMaker versus other alternatives, such as existing software or other RAD tools; how to determine fee structure and how much to charge; how to strengthen your relationship with existing clients and keep them interested in ongoing developments.  2) Navigation can be as easy as A-B-C Let’s say you have a Portal listing people to select. You don’t want the users to scroll, because it doesn’t work well in FileMaker Go or FileMaker Web Direct, so you use a Slide Control and set the Portal to display 1–20, 21–40, etc. John Morina of Pueblo Systems, Inc. will present a version using letters instead numbers. 3) TBD 4) Bring your FileMaker questions and ask the audience.

Data Science + the EHR: Summarizing the Patient Record and Characterizing Progression of Disease The Electronic Health Record (EHR) comes laden with an ambitious array of promises: at the point of patient care, it will improve quality of documentation, reduce cost of care, and promote patient safety; in parallel, as more and more data are collected about patients, the EHR gives rise to exciting opportunities for mining patient characteristics and holds out the hope of compiling comprehensive phenotypic information. Leveraging the information  present in the EHR is not a trivial step, however, especially when it comes to the information conveyed in clinical notes. In this talk I will focus on one of the challenges faced by the EHR and its users: information overload.  With ever-growing longitudinal health records, it is difficult for clinicians to keep track of what is salient to their information needs when treating individual patients. I will present two applications and their methods: a disease progression model that learns from the longitudinal patient record, and HARVEST, a real-time summarisation system deployed at New York-Presbyterian  Hospital.

Abstract: Esther Dyson, formerly a techy and a trained cosmonaut, is now taking on the new goal of defining and demonstrating health as an asset class – a store of value resident in human bodies. Health is neither directly tangible, nor is it owned, but it does create value (or reduce costs) for entities that should be willing to pay for it – insurers, employers, communities, governments.  Esther discusses how she came to this work and how health can defined and how the value it creates can be measured, attributed and funded.  This initiative will require a lot of hard work and persuasion to turn this asset into a fungible financial product.  Esther will discuss what can/should we do about the negative externalities of junk food, addictive substances, and other attractions of modern life. Bio:  Esther Dyson is an angel investor, and the founder of Wellville, a nonprofit initiative to produce health in five small (&lt;200,000 population) US communities.  She is on the board of health-oriented companies including 23andMe and Voxiva. She is an investor in Applied Proteomics, Clover Health, CUR, Eligible API, GeriJoy, Health Tap, HealthLoop, Medesk, Medivo, Medicalgorithmics, Meetup, Omada Health, PatientsLikeMe, PatientsKnowBest, Proofpilot, StartupHealth and others.  In addition, she is on the board of and research subject #3 for the Personal Genome Project.  Esther received her BA in Economics from Harvard.

All lecture materials can be found at: www.quantopian.com/lectures. Pizza and beverages will be provided by Quantopian. Speaker Details: Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie is an engineer at Quantopian whose focus is on how Quantopian can be used as a teaching tool. After studying computer science at Princeton, Delaney joined Quantopian in 2014.

98552,113696,4595352,"228034166","Two Fabulous Talks for our January Meetup! Talk 1: Matt Ström Title: Tiny Data Visualizations in the Newsroom Description: Charts and graphs are a key component of news reporting today, either as corroborating evidence or a visual representation of prose. The trend today is towards large, pre-composed, interactive elements. Tiny, contextual, generative charts can communicate information better than words or even a larger graph could. Using D3, along with plain JS and CSS, we can create in-line data visualizations that are theoretically sound and incredibly informative. Bio: In 2013 Matt Strom co-founded Planetary, a company that builds web interfaces for the likes of GE, Pepsi, and the Daily Beast. Matt is a designer, developer, musician, photographer, collector of watches, and amateur astronaut. Talk 2: Paul Levande Title: Nobody Understands Mass Incarceration (But D3 Can Help) Description: Everyone's talking about mass incarceration these days, but nobody really understands it--myself included. The flexibility and interactivity provided by D3 can, however, help show the contrasts between the incarceration histories of different states, allow people to look at different combinations of offenses, or clarify the relationships between different rates. My talk will discuss the difficulties of understanding mass incarceration and how I used D3 to try to clarify things, with references to: &lt;a&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt;xenocrypt.github.io/UnderstandingIncarceration.html https://medium.com/@xenocryptsite/why-you-don-t-understand-mass-incarceration-d6c6140f4767#.v0ax0wycn http://xenocrypt.github.io/NealRick.html Bio: Paul Levande is a mathematician and researcher who writes about applying quantitative techniques and data visualization to political and social issues.

Site creator David Moore will demo how Councilmatic connects visitors to official government info, with the ability to add comments to any item of NYC legislation. We’ll walk through the process of researching data-energy issues on the platform, and identifying key points of contact in the city council to advance smart cities initiatives. Also: we’ll discuss how open standards for legislative information can help cities spread best practices and analyze policy, and how forthcoming alert features could be best designed to keep Smart Cities attendees up-to-date when their issues are on the agenda in committee hearings. Overall, it’s open city data + crowdsourced policy, working towards a vision of continual conversation and expert input for NYC building standards and more.

As the people that build these systems, we have a social responsibility to consider how these systems affect people, and furthermore, we should do whatever we can to prevent these systems and models from perpetuating some of the prejudice and bias that exist in our society today.  In this talk I intend to cover some of the recommendation systems that have gone wrong across various industries, and attempt to provide some solutions for prevention. First and foremost among these is awareness, but approaches involving interpretable models, using ensemble models to separate features that shouldn't interact, and designing test data sets for capturing bias will also be explored.","26 Jan 2016","19:00","54 West 21st Street, Suite 404 New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

At the center of the current schism rests the soft vs. hard fork debate and how it relates to governance structures and code development. This event will allow us to explore this topic. The event will be structured to allow each side of the debate to express their opinions without talking past one another; discussion will begin with members stating the assumptions on which their logic rest. Once assumptions have been stated, members representing each side of the debate will be given the opportunity to question those assumptions. While the hard vs soft fork debate is predominantly technical, it reaches beyond that into questions of ideological merit. Discussions of this nature will be allowed but will be moderated to avoid endless debate. Here is the main topic for discussion, listed below are subtopics. Feel free to suggest other topics in the comments section: hard vs. soft forks -- when do they make sense? • Uncontroversial vs Controversial forks (95% vs 75%) • Soft segwit vs Hard 2MB bump for immediate release  • Soft vs hard segwit • Is democratic code development healthy for Bitcoin? / If Bitcoin is neither democracy or dictatorship, what is it?  • Layer 2--is it the best method to scale Bitcoin? Is it inevitability?

Intro   Of all the ways to manipulate a 3D mesh, the “push/pull” technique popularized by SketchUp is one of the most approachable and fun. PushPull++ is a recent paper that elaborates on the technique, cleaning up a lot of edge cases and unlocking new features, using wonderfully straightforward math. The potential for 3D modeling tools or procedural mesh generation APIs built on these simple ideas is very exciting. The paper presents the technique and the tool that the authors built. I will focus on the technique, as that’s the part I loved more in this paper. **Also, check out this video on the work!** Bio Ramsey Nasser (@ra) is a computer scientist, game designer, and educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by building tools to make computation more expressive and implementing projects that question the basic assumptions we make about code itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones, and are often written in experimental programming languages of his design. A former Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table Coders, when he is not reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains vintage motorcycles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  TwoSigma - Platinum Sponsor of the New York chapter ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Details Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be refreshments of all kinds and pizza.

Overview of the learning session Data visualization involves the presentation of data in a graphical format with the goal of communicating information more clearly and efficiently to audiences. This session will focus on dashboards. Dashboards provide a visual display of your program’s or organization’s status. They are valuable because they quickly provide information about areas of strength and challenge, and all necessary information is available in one convenient location. During the session, Taj and Dana will talk about the basics of developing a dashboard and how to select the best medium for the visual presentation of your data (i.e., should it be a static document, or an interactive and dynamic dashboard?) They will also provide examples of dashboards and talk about aspects of DataViz design that work for programs of all varieties.

Cotton, associate professor and director, Biomedical Forensic Sciences, Boston University School of Medicine https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/event/2016-robin-w-cotton-lecture  The use of DNA for the analysis of biological evidence began in the US in 1987 and has had a positive and permanent effect on all forensic testing. DNA testing has lead in development of standards for forensic laboratory testing, and standards for all types of forensic testing are currently being developed thru the NIST Organization of Scientific Area Committees. http://www.nist.gov/forensics/osac/index.cfm Rapid non-laboratory based DNA testing equipment and DNA sequencing methods for forensic application, along with the associated “big data,"" will present the next methodological changes and challenges. However, the roughness of the intersection between science and law has not significantly improved and continues to challenge forensic science practitioners and lawyers representing both the defense and prosecution sides of criminal cases. This talk will review current scientific and laboratory challenges and discuss the issues encountered when forensic scientists, lawyers, and judges all try to “do the right thing” together.

Evans, data scientist at Exaptive, provides a conceptual and technical look at text analysis on big data with open source tools. His fodder is 70 years of State of the Union Addresses, from Truman to Obama, and 20 years of Congressional hearing transcripts. Using R, he performs text clustering to identify trends. Using Python, he goes a step further to create topic models that identify commonalities and differences between presidencies. Then combining Python with Spark, he topic models a data set 2500 times as big. He’ll explain the statistics methods behind each analysis and show how he implemented them in code. He’ll also explain how to produce plots or even some live data applications to let others explore the modeled data. About Speaker: Frank D.

Evans, data scientist at Exaptive, provides a conceptual and technical look at text analysis on big data with open source tools. His fodder is 70 years of State of the Union Addresses, from Truman to Obama, and 20 years of Congressional hearing transcripts. Using R, he performs text clustering to identify trends. Using Python, he goes a step further to create topic models that identify commonalities and differences between presidencies. Then combining Python with Spark, he topic models a data set 2500 times as big. He’ll explain the statistics methods behind each analysis and show how he implemented them in code. He’ll also explain how to produce plots or even some live data applications to let others explore the modeled data. About Speaker: Frank D. Evans (@frankdevans) is a data scientist with an expertise in Big Data, especially text analysis. His work spans financial, behavioral, and political analytics. Frank recently gave a TEDx talk on how data science can fix gerrymandering.","10 Feb 2016","18:00","(South Station) 745 Atlantic Ave Boston",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

So lets compress all the tables! No--unfortunately, it's not that easy. We'll talk about how data compression actually works, and the differences between ROW and PAGE compression. As part of this, we'll look at the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

Among the most important decisions is whether to approach BDA with traditional, proprietary products or with open source frameworks and technologies. In this presentation, Pivotal's Jeff Kelly will discuss why an open source approach, though not without its challenges, is the better way to lay the technology foundation for extracting the most value from your data. Bio: Jeff Kelly is a Big Data strategist at Pivotal Software. In this role, Jeff spends his time researching, writing and speaking about trends impacting Big Data analytics in the enterprise and best practices for success. Prior to joining Pivotal, Jeff was the lead Big Data analyst at research firm Wikibon, where he published the industry's first Big Data market forecast in 2012.

102993,123148,18258270,"228618890","Consumer electronics is in transition. We are shifting from creating value and defining products using electronics to creating solutions using software. Consider the smartphone: is it a telephone, or is it a gaming unit, a calendar a camera or a television? With other form factors we can mix or match parts to create a desktop computer, a television, a home control system or whatever we can imagine. Many single-use devices and classic limitations no longer exist. The Internet is central to this revolution. It is a byproduct of creating connectivity solutions using any available means. The Internet represents a fundamental change in how we build systems and in what it means to communicate. You simply click on a URL and you're ""there"". You don't worry about wires or reserved frequency. You can just assume that the packets will appear at the destination most of the time. Using software defined relationships as building blocks is very different from traditional hardware-based engineering. Welcome to the new world of software and the Internet. There's no dependence on providers or networks. For the IEEE these changes present an opportunity and challenge. Devices are becoming connected, opening up new frontiers as we create and share our own solutions and become less dependent on service providers. We're at the very earliest stages of an exciting new world.  Bob Frankston is a Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and the Computer History Museum. He is on the Board of Governors and is a Distinguished Lecturer for the IEEE Consumer Electronics Society. He writes the Bits Vs. Electrons column in the IEEE/CE Magazine. He has been online since 1966 and was co-developer of the first electronic spreadsheet and has been honored by the IEEE for his contributions to home networking while at Microsoft. He received BS degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics and Master's and Engineer's degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering all from MIT. Since leaving Microsoft he has been doing angel investing and advising. He is currently working with entrepreneurs and established companies on the issues we face as we transition to a software-defined connected world.

What You'll Learn At This Meetup: Cassandra on Windows: As of release 2.2, Windows is an officially supported platform for OSS Cassandra. It was a long road to get here and there's still some sharp edges, so we're going to cover how we got here, what to watch out for, and where we might explore in the future of Cassandra on Windows. We're also going to cover the elephant in the room: ""Why bother?"" Change-Data-Capture: We'll spend some time discussing the design process that's gone into  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8844 and the difficulties we've hit, taking into account where C* falls with regards to CAP theorem.

The idea that servers weren’t the commodity, but that the CPU and RAM they contained were the resources that mattered revolutionized how hardware was bought, how maintenance was performed and how application sizing was done. Unfortunately, while this transformation was going on, storage steadfastly refused to get the memo. A lack of innovation, a clear desire to rely on old, limited architectures to protect margins and an ecosystem that didn’t demand those things left us with a storage market full of legacy products, incapable of adapting to new technology or consumption models. With the advent of flash, however, both the flaws and some possible solutions to this situation have become clear. Flash-only, scale out architectures have begun appearing on the landscape, with the promise of doing to storage what the first wave of virtualization did to the server market. What are these new architectures? How are they changing how storage is managed? How are they changing how IT looks at and purchases the resources needed to support new and different workloads? Join Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Flash Architect from SolidFire, to discuss these topics and more, and take a look at how storage architecture might be able to change the industry.  Speaker Bio: Jeramiah Dooley, Principal Architect, Technology Solutions Jeramiah Dooley is a Principal Architect, focusing on VMware, OpenStack and SolidFire converged infrastructure solutions. He brings more than 17 years of technology and design experience to his industry efforts.  He was most recently part of the VCE Office of the CTO, working with technology executives around the world on strategies to converge and transform IT infrastructure and operations. Previously, he was the global SME for Service Provider business development, multi-tenancy and vCloud Director design as part of the Field Enablement team within the VCE Corporate Engineering Group.  He also developed Service Provider and Vertical Solutions for VCE, helping customers by providing pre-tested and validated guidelines for running different applications on Vblock platforms, including Cisco Unified Communications, VMware vCloud Director, and ESRI ArcGIS Server among others.  Prior to joining VCE, Mr. Dooley was the Director of Engineering for Managed Services at Peak 10, a regional service provider based in Charlotte, NC. He directed the overall strategy, design and development of Peak 10's Managed Services platform, which included the company's Cloud Services, Data Protection, Managed Storage, Managed Security Device Management and BC/DR divisions. He has also held technology positions in the healthcare, legal and telecommunications fields during his career.  8:00 - 8:45 Intel's 3D XPoint™ Technology Revolutionizes Memory and Storage  Intel engineers shattered all the rules with 3D XPoint™ technology, a simple, stackable, and transistor-less design that creates fast, inexpensive, and nonvolatile storage memory with low latency to unleash   processors’ true potential. The presentation will provide a brief history of memory technology from the 1960's to now and how the 3D XPoint™ breakthrough technology combines memory and storage in one non-volatile device that is cheaper than DRAM and faster than NAND.

104039,122019,4379272,"228440768","Rough agenda:  6 - 6:30: Networking and Pizza 6:30 - 7:30: Three Speakers (1) Eric Miller, professor, Tufts University. ""Perspectives on Computational Sensing: Physics, Data, and Uncertainty"" Abstract: Characterizing the internal structure of a region of space in a noninvasive manner arises across a wide range of applications.  Common to all of these problems are challenges associated with (a) the physics of the sensing modality or modalities; (b)  the nature of the data, sometimes big, sometimes small, frequently insufficient; and (c) and systematic uncertainty associated with the sensor system itself or the medium under investigation.  This talk will focus on a discussion of these issues, how they intersect, and methods for addressing them in the context of four problems: hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography, subsurface contaminant source zone characterization, satellite remote sensing, and X-ray CT for airport security scanning. (2) Rob Holt, inviCRO, LLC. ""Medical Image Analysis for Drug Discovery and Validation"" Abstract: Medical images are used for more than diagnosing disease.  The pharmaceutical industry relies on high-volume, high-throughput small animal medical imaging to make decisions in the drug production pipeline.  Early recognition of the failure of a drug can save a company millions and prevent the undue loss of life and well-being through over-testing.  Quantitation can come from a variety of sources, but is mostly done through longitudinal tracking of biomarkers among control and treatment cohorts of animals.  The image contrast comes from across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, each with its own challenges and advantages.  From idea to implementation, from mouse to man, inviCRO supports drug development through quantitative analysis of medical images using cutting-edge and proprietary analysis algorithms. (3) Allen Goodman, Broad Insitute of Harvard and MIT. ""imaged: A distributed storage and retrieval store for microscopy images"" Abstract: imaged (im·aged or image·d) is a distributed storage and retrieval store for microscopy images. It's more affordable and available than the archetypical system of network attached storage (NAS) appliances running the network file system (NFS). We've made two key observations: first, by coupling conflict resolution, key-value lookup, and version control, availability is guaranteed by accepting inconsistency under minor failure modes; second, since most disk operations are metadata lookups, by reducing per-image metadata, machines can perform metadata lookups in memory, which conserves disk operations for reading data, thereby increasing overall throughput.

THANKS! https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-boston-2016-tickets-20590413481 --- Please join Code for Boston for a weekend of civic hacking, youth mentorship, and code education at our third annual CodeAcross event on March 5-6, 2015 at the Roxbury Innovation Center. Our goal for this year's CodeAcross is to start building the next generation of civic hackers through a curated, educational hackathon. Pretty cool, right?! To do this, Code for Boston is partnering with Resilient Coders, a code education non-profit focused on underserved youth, on what we're calling a progression hackathon: a structured hacking event where novice coders and students work in teams with experienced software developers and designers on hacakathon projects, and learn fundamental dev skills like ideation and wireframing, Github and source control, and more through a series of fast-paced, educational workshops. At CodeAcross, we'll bring together civic technologists, community organizations, and local businesses to work collaboratively on projects around career building, equity, and economic development. Although this year's event is more focused on technology than our usual events, CodeAcross will always be open to the entire community: Community involvement and inclusion are extremely important to us, and our best projects always have a mix of technical and non-technical team members. We can't wait to see you all for a couple days of learning, teaching, collaborating, and civic hacking!  CodeAcross would not be possible without the generosity of the following organizations:   http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130910/SF76762LOGO","05 Mar 2016","10:00","2300 Washington Street Boston",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

A must-see for those involved in transformation and creativity. THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING presents seven powerful portraits of communities on the front lines of both fossil fuel extraction and the climate crisis it is driving, from Montana’s Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands, from the coast of South India to Beijing and beyond. Interwoven with these stories of struggle is Klein’s narration, connecting the carbon in the air with the economic system that put it there. The film builds to its most controversial and exciting idea: that we can seize the existential crisis of climate change to transform our failed economic system into something radically better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpuSt_ST4_U The extraordinary detail and richness of the cinematography in This Changes Everything provides an epic canvas for this exploration of the greatest challenge of our time. Unlike many works about the climate crisis, this is not a film that tries to scare the audience into action: it aims to empower. Provocative, compelling, and accessible to even the most climate-fatigued viewers, This Changes Everything will leave you refreshed and inspired, reflecting on the ties between us, the kind of lives we really want, and why the climate crisis is at the centre of it all.","08 Feb 2016","18:15","99 Madison Ave., 15th Floor New York",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

He will discuss the challenges of data normalizations, the differences in showing data to docs and patients, and share some lessons learned that can be used by anyone in their next health data project. Bio: David is the co-founder and executive director of Open mHealth.

He holds a masters degree in health economics and policy from the London School of Economics and a bachelor's in chemistry and public health from UC Berkeley. Polyglot Visualization with the Beaker Notebook by Scott Draves Abstract: Beaker is an open source tool for data analysis and data visualization.  Beaker has an innovative UI and unique architecture to make it easier for novices to get started and enable experts to work faster. You can combine all your favorite visualization libraries even from different languages on the same page and working with the same data.  Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based UI metaphor, but Beaker was designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple languages that communicate with one another through a unique feature called autotranslation. You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell, and everything just works. Beaker comes with built-in support for Python, R, JavaScript, Java, Scala, Clojure, Torch/Lua, Julia, and more. Each part of your problem can be solved in the language best suited to it. For example, you can scrape the Web in Python, do a regression in R, and then visualize it with D3.js seamlessly in the same notebook. Draves will motivate the design, review the architecture, and give a live demo of Beaker in action. Bio: Scott Draves is an award-winning software artist, VJ, and pioneer of the open source movement. His clients and exhibitions range from the likes of MoMA.org, LACMA, Prix Ars Electronica, Lumen Prize, ZKM, Google, and the Adler Planetarium to Skrillex.

105093,127393,18706743,"228236391"," Open source, open science, and the brain - Jeremy Freeman We want to understand how brains work. Modern neuroscience offers unprecedented access to the brain, but also unprecedented complexity and diversity, both in the experiments we can do and the data we can generate. I will describe several open source technologies we are working on, for everything from 3d visualization to large-scale computing, from reproducible analysis notebooks to mobile games. I'll try to convey both what we're learning about the brain with these tools -- and how modern computation, and the web, is changing the very way we do science. Jeremy Freeman is a neuroscientist at Janelia Labs focusing on the intersection of biology and computation.  Specifically, his research is on understanding how the brain supports complex behavior, and how it might inform the design of intelligent systems. Jeremy is passionate about open source and open science, helping to build tools for collaboration and reproducibility, and working with scientists, developers, and designers across a range of fields.  Jeremy is one of the key contributors for CodeNeuro. OpenEXP - Teon Brooks &amp; Andy Heusser Our projectOpenEXP is an open-source platform to facilitate large-scale neuroscience and psychology experiment execution and data collection. The primary aims of the project are to 1) provide an easy and robust application for designing and executing EEG and behavioral experiments, 2) to provide customizable real time visualization of EEG data and 3) to provide a web based open-access repository for EEG and behavioral data on classic and custom psychology and cognitive neuroscience experiments.  We hope that this application will provide tools to combat the problems of reproducibility in scientific experiments, promote collaboration among geographically distributed researchers, and to foster communication of psychological science to the general public. Teon Brooks is a PhD candidate at New York University in the Department of Psychology finishing his degree in cognitive neuroscience. His research focuses on the neuroscience of reading and developing new techniques for predicting eye-movement behaviors, such as, reading times on text, from the underlying brain activity. His primary methods include EEG/MEG and eye-tracking. Andy Heusser is a PhD candidate at New York University in the Department of Psychology. Broadly, his dissertation research focuses on the neural mechanisms involved in the formation and organization of episodic memories.  Using primarily behavioral and EEG/MEG methods, his current work is designed to investigate how neural oscillations support memory for temporal sequences of information.","09 Feb 2016","19:00","222 Broadway, 19th Floor New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Of particular significance amongst functionalities Bloomberg offers is a real-time news search and alerting system which offers it's customers information in a timely manner. While providing a real-time search engine with low latency and even lower index to search latency is a challenge in itself, what makes Bloomberg's offering unique is real-time alerting on any arbitrarily complex boolean query supported by the search engine. So what does it take to build an alerting engine which stores millions of query subscriptions changing every second, and matches them against hundreds of stories coming in every second at peak, to dynamically update user's screens, e-mail them, show popups or otherwise notify them when a news story matches their interest? And what does it take to do this all this in less than 100ms? In this talk, Daniel Collins of the News Search backend team dives into the alerting backend his team maintains, and the story of how they rewrote this entire alerting infrastructure using and enhancing Lucene, and Luwak, a library for managing stored queries. Bio: Daniel is a member of the News Search backend team at the Bloomberg R&amp;D office in London. He joined Bloomberg in 2011, after 12 years working in R&amp;D in the telecoms space working on both fixed and mobile telecoms solutions. He started working with Apache Solr/Lucene in 2012, and has led the effort on migrating news' indexing and alerting pipeline from the existing infrastructure to using Lucene, Luwak and Solr.","10 Feb 2016","18:30","156 5th Avenue,2nd floor New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Link to course: https://www.udacity.com/course/progress#!/c-ud730 Please make sure you have viewed the videos for the first section (L1) and have downloaded and installed the TensorFlow software using the instructions here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity We will go through the first assignment from here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb I would like to remind everybody that these hands on sessions are for developers, and will be too hardcore if you have a superficial or passing interest in the technology and/or less than intermediate level programming experience. In this case, I would encourage you to update your RSVP so someone who is a developer can attend and you are welcome to attend our social Happy Hours instead where we can chat on a high level over drinks and not as deeply into working with hands on coding, as well as other technology presentation events we are lining up for 2016!   Please note that non-attendance after RSVPing Yes for events with a waitlist could bar you from attending future events in order to accommodate folks who would like to attend.","11 Feb 2016","18:30","43 West 23rd street, 2nd Floor New York",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

105606,134603,11398322,"228110831","We're **crazy** excited to have Bryan Cantrill, CTO of Joyent, formerly of Sun Microsystems, presenting on Jails: Confining the omnipotent root. by Poul-Henning Kamp and Robert Watson and Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads by Dan Price and Andy Tucker! You can also catch Bryan presenting at the NYC Container Summit on February 10th, which also is hosting an advanced technical track, which includes hand-on tutorials! Also, watch this amazing illumos presentation by Bryan in 2011!  Abstracts Jails: Confining the omnipotent root. =========================== The traditional UNIX security model is simple but inexpressive. Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, ‘‘inappropriate’’ rapidly transitions to‘‘nightmarish’’, especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The FreeBSD ‘‘Jail’’ facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX‘‘root’’ model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments. Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads =========================================== Server consolidation, which allows multiple workloads to run on the same system, has become increasingly important as a way to improve the utilization of computing resources and reduce costs. Consolidation is common in mainframe environments, where technology to support running multiple workloads and even multiple operating systems on the same hardware has been evolving since the late 1960’s. This technology is now becoming an important differentiator in the UNIX and Linux server market as well, both at the low end (virtual web hosting) and high end(traditional data center server consolidation).This paper introduces Solaris Zones (zones), a fully realized solution for server consolidation projects in a commercial UNIX operating system. By creating virtualized application execution environments within a single instance of the operating system, the facility strikes a unique balance between competing requirements. On the one hand, a system with multiple workloads needs to run those workloads in isolation, to ensure that applications can neither observe data from other applications nor affect their operation. It must also prevent applications from over-consuming system resources. On the other hand, the system as a whole has to be flexible, manageable, and observable, in order to reduce administrative costs and increase efficiency. By focusing on the support of multiple application environments rather than multiple operating system instances, zones meets isolation requirements without sacrificing manageability. Bio &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""http://tomasp.net""&gt; Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide development of the SmartOS and SmartDataCenter platforms, and the Node.js platform. Prior to joining Joyent, Bryan served as a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he spent over a decade working on system software, from the guts of the kernel to client-code on the browser. In particular, he co-designed and implemented DTrace, a facility for dynamic instrumentation of production systems that won the Wall Street Journal's top Technology Innovation Award in 2006 and the USENIX Software Tools User Group Award in 2008. Bryan also co-founded the Fishworks group at Sun, where he designed and implemented the DTrace-based analytics facility for the Sun Storage 7000 series of appliances. Bryan received the ScB magna cum laude with honors in Computer Science from Brown University. ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Koonin | Director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University TITLE:Adventures in Urban Informatics ABSTRACT:For the first time in history, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas; in just a few more decades, the world's population will exceed 9 billion, 70 percent of whom will live in cities. Enabling those cities to deliver services effectively, efficiently, and sustainably while keeping their citizens safe, healthy, prosperous, and well-informed will be among the most important undertakings in this century. I will review how we are establishing a center for urban science and focus on bringing informatics to the study and operation of urban systems. I will touch on the rational, the structure, and the substance of the Center's work and the ways in which it will enrich NYC and contribute to global issues. Taxis, lights, sewers, phones, and buildings will all enter into the discussion in novel ways. BIOGRAPHY:Steven E. Koonin was appointed as the founding Director of NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress in April 2012. That consortium of academic, corporate, and government partners will pursue research and education activities to develop and demonstrate informatics technologies for urban problems in the ""living laboratory"" of New York City. He previously served as the U.S. Department of Energy's second Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Science from May 19, 2009 through November 18, 2011. As Under Secretary for Science, Dr. Koonin functioned as the Department's chief scientific officer, coordinating and overseeing research across the DOE. He led the preparation of the Department's 2011 Strategic Plan and was the principal author of its Quadrennial Technology Review. Dr. Koonin particularly championed research programs in High Performance Simulation, Exascale Computing, Inertial Fusion Energy, and Greenhouse Gas Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification. He also provided technical counsel on diverse nuclear security matters. He joined the California Institute of Technology's faculty in 1975, was a research fellow at the Niels Bohr Institute during[masked], and was an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow during 1977-1979. He became a professor of theoretical physics at Caltech in 1981 and served as Chairman of the Faculty from 1989-1991. Dr. Koonin was the seventh provost of Caltech from 1995-2004. In that capacity, he was involved in identifying and recruiting 1/3 of the Institute's professorial faculty and left an enduring legacy of academic and research initiatives in the biological, physical, earth, and social sciences, as well as the planning and development of the Thirty-Meter Telescope project. As the Chief Scientist at BP from 2004 to early 2009, Dr. Koonin developed the long-range technology strategy for alternative and renewable energy sources. He managed the firm's university-based research programs and played a central role in establishing the Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Koonin is a member and past chair of the JASON Study Group, advising the U.S. Government on technical matters of national security. He has served on numerous advisory committees for the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense, including the Defense Science Board and the CNO's Executive Panel. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Trilateral Commission and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences . In 1985, Dr. Koonin received the Humboldt Senior U.S. Scientist Award and, in 1998 the Department of Energy's E.O. Lawrence Award for his broad impact on nuclear many-body physics, on astrophysics, and on a variety of related fields where sophisticated numerical methods are essential; and in particular, for his breakthrough in nuclear shell model calculations centered on an ingenious method for dealing with the huge matrices of heavy nuclei by using path integral methods combined with the Monte Carlo technique.

In this talk, we’ll go over the progress that has been made so far and the areas we’re looking to invest in next. This talk will discuss the architectural changes that are being made as well as some discussion into how Spark users can expect their application to benefit from this effort. The focus of the talk will be on Spark SQL but the improvements are general and applicable to multiple Spark technologies. Ram Sriharsha from Hortonworks will present Magellan: Spark as a Geospatial Analytics EngineSuppose you have a large volume of point in space data (think mobile GPS coordinates). You want to join this dataset with shapes (be it neighborhoods in New York boroughs, the road system in NYC, the canal systems in Amsterdam, what have you). How do you do this join at scale? Our goal in this talk is to show how we are solving this problem using Magellan and Spark. Magellan is a newly open sourced geospatial analytics engine written on top of Spark and is the first such engine to deeply leverage Spark SQL, Dataframes and Catalyst for spacial analytics.  This talk will focus on one specific aspect of Magellan: how does Magellan implement Spatial Joins, and where does it leverage Spark SQL for efficiency and simplicity? The talk should be of interest to developers who wish to understand how to leverage Spark SQL in richer ways than before, those interested in writing specialized analytics engines on top of Spark SQL, and Data Scientists and Data Engineers who wish to perform spatial analytics processing or predictive analytics on geospatial datasets at scale.

107616,135586,15316562,"228729143","Abstract: Apache Mesos provides a platform for building distributed systems. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with API’s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments. How to use that platform and what to make of it becomes a complex task requiring not only understanding of where the system has been but also where it is going. Using schedulers like Marathon and Aurora help to get your applications scheduled and executing on Mesos. In many cases it makes sense to build a framework and integrate directly. This talk will breakdown what is involved in building a framework in Go, how to-do this with examples and why you would want to-do this. Frameworks are not only for generally available software applications (like Kafka, HDFS, Spark ,etc) but should  also be used for custom internal R&amp;D built software applications too.

At Caserta Concepts, we are firm believers in big data thriving on the cloud.  The instant-on, nearly unlimited storage and computing capabilities of AWS has made it the defacto solution for a full spectrum of organizations needing to process large amounts of data.  What's more, an ecosystem of value-added platforms has emerged to further ease and democratize the implementation of cloud based solutions.  Qubole  has developed a great platform for easily deploying and managing ephemeral and long-lived Hadoop and Spark clusters on AWS.  Moving Past Infrastructure Limitations: Data Warehousing at MediaMath Over the past year and a half, MediaMath has undertaken a “data liberation” effort in an attempt to leave their bigbox, monolithic data warehouse behind. In this talk, Rory Sawyer, Software Engineer at MediaMath, will describe how this effort transformed MediaMath’s legacy architecture and legacy mindset, which imposed harsh inefficiencies on data sharing and utilization. The current mindset removes these inefficiencies and allows them to say “yes” to more projects and ideas. Rory will also demo how MediaMath uses Amazon Web Services and Qubole so that infrastructure is no longer a limiting factor on what and how users query. This combination allows them to scale their resources up and down as needed while bridging different data sources and execution engines. Using and extending MediaMath’s data warehousing is no longer a privileged activity but an ability that every employee and client has.  Speakers: Elliott Cordo, Chief Architect at Caserta Concepts Elliott is a big data, data warehouse and information management expert with a passion for helping companies transform their data into powerful information so they can better manage their financial and operational performance.

These little interactive apps that are created in R are great ways of manipulating and visualizing data. This demo event has always been fun and a favorite of our community. Please Enjoy! Presenters: Amy Ma: How AirBnB is in NYC? Visiting NYC? Airbnb may be a good choice to book unique accommodations. To better explore its rental listings across New York City, Amy Ma designed this app to answer some questions: How many of the listings are for an entire home versus a room in an apartment? How many are controlled by the same host? Why tax Issue is serious in Airbnb NYC? Should you think twice before trusting an review? Results also provide suggestions for Airbnb, hosts and visitors. Sricharan Maddineni: Why are Airports Important?  Aviation infrastructure has been a bedrock of the United States economy and culture for many decades, and I've created an interactive map to show the connectedness of US airports as well as a motion chart which shows the evolution of airline passengers vs population for the world's countries over the last four decades. Christopher Redino: Health Indicators and Geographic Factors  The World Health Organization lists obesity as one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Although genetics play a role in the likelihood of obesity in an individual, lifestyle (by choice or otherwise) is also an important factor that cannot be ignored. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene conducts an annual Community Health Survey (CHS) wherein they collect data on a variety of health factors from thousands of New Yorkers in all five boroughs. Some of this data is used in this app to visualize how large an effect our geography has on obesity rates, even on a scale as small as the span of a few miles between neighbourhoods in NYC. Which geographic factors are causing this difference in rates is somewhat an open question: is the availability of fresh food more important, or the median income of residents in a particular neighbourhood? In addition to visually exploring the survey data, the app allows the user to explore the effect of different types of food vendors on the obesity rate of different neighborhoods. Wendy Yu: Interactive data visualization of gender pay gap in the United States Gender pay gap is a continuous problem in the United States. To date, women are still making about 20% less then their male counterparts. I collected data from United States Census Bureau and created an interactive app to explore changes of gender pay gap over the past decades. Michael Todisco: MLB 2012 Attendance  This Shiny Application visualizes Major League Baseball attendance data for the 2012 season. A user can select any of the 30 teams in baseball and then interactively filter attendance data based on categories such as game time (day vs night), temperature, weather, promotion, and opponent's winning percentage. The results are displayed in four main graphs: 1) attendance vs opponent 2) attendance vs day of the week 3) attendance vs month 4) season trending attendance. Brett Amdur: Understanding Regression Diagnostics: An Introduction  For his Shiny project, Brett created an educational tool that uses visuals and interactivity to help explain the diagnostic tests that assess the validity of a regression analysis. The tool allows users to choose from among several different several data sets (most of which come from the well known Anscombe's Quartet) to see how their diagnostic plots differ. The tool also allows users to make adjustments to the data to see how changes in the data can influence the diagnostics.","16 Feb 2016","19:00","500 8th Ave, Suite 905 New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Enabling Python a Become a Better Big Data Citizen - Wes McKinney The Python ecosystem has long struggled with interoperability with the Apache Hadoop and Spark ecosystems due to architectural issues around JVM-Python interoperability and the high cost of moving data between processes. In spite of that, Python has been used extensively as a limited tool for processing streams of serialized data sent via UNIX pipes or other means. In this talk, Wes McKinney explains current efforts to enable pandas and other 3rd-party Python libraries to be used in a more native and performant way within big data computation frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Impala (inc), and Apache Drill, as well as with storage projects like Apache Kudu (inc) and Apache Parquet.

Your RSVP is required to add your name to the building security guest list. Please keep your RSVP up-to-date should you find yourself unable to come. MAIN PRESENTATION Exposing an Extensibility API for your Applications (by Miguel Castro) Writing software that can be maintained is and always has been crucial. But so is writing software that can be enhanced and extended. It’s become quite commonplace for many apps today to expose APIs so externally written apps can have access to their data or their services. But imagine how cool it is to expose an API for changing or extending an application’s functionality. I’m talking about the ability to use the architecture of an application in order to enhance that system. This is the power of the patterns and techniques I’m going to show you in this session. They’re very useful and very geeky so bring your propeller hat. About Miguel Castro: Whether playing on the local Radio Shack’s TRS-80 or designing systems for clients around the globe, Miguel has been writing software since he was 12 years old. He insists on staying heavily involved and up-to-date on all aspects of software application design &amp; development, and projects that diversity onto the type of training and consulting he provides to his customers and believes that it’s never just about understanding the technologies, but how technologies work together. In fact, it is on this concept that Miguel based two of his Pluralsight courses, Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications, which was #1 for several weeks, and Developing Extensible Sotware. Miguel is a Microsoft MVP since 2005 and when he’s not consulting or training, Miguel speaks at conferences around the world, practices combining on-stage tech and comedy, and never misses a Formula 1 race. But best of all, he’s the proud father of a very tech-savvy 10 year old girl, and a proud husband to the woman that homeschools her.","18 Feb 2016","18:00","11 Times Square, 6th Floor New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Yet ""strong AI"" in some ways still seems elusive. In this talk, I will give a cognitive scientist's perspective on AI. What have we learned, and what are we still struggling with? Is there anything that researchers of AI can still learn from studying the science of human cognition?

So, this presentation will explore the amazing advancements available today, that can enable apps and devices to interact with us like we do with other people. We'll help attendees to understand the difference between NUI and HUI, what exactly HUI is, where it's headed, how to best use it in projects and products, how to create amazing HUI based user experiences, and touch on some of the array of API's available right now. 

HUI™ is the cusp of a shift in UI/UX that every major tech company is investing in and rolling out and a stream of new start-ups are developing API's, devices, and services around. There's no more crucial time for you to grow your knowledge of this than now! Presented by HUI Central Organizers:  Deb Benkler and Ken Lonyai are well known as New York's HUI™ (and NUI) evangelists. They are co-founders of the planet's largest HUI community, HUI Central™ and have worked closely with Microsoft and IBM, managing really cool HUI oriented hackathons including the NUI Central Watson Hackathon and NUI Central Kinect for Windows Hackathon 2015. In 2016, the pair are leveraging their expertise by launching a dev studio/consultancy called humanize™, to guide brands in the development of apps/products/services that utilize HUI to deliver more meaningful and engaging user experiences to their customers. The two were at the helm when ScreenPlay InterActive received a 2012 User Experience Award (a UXie) as well as the company's creation of a bunch of leading edge technologies that utilize all five senses interactively. 8:00PM - 8:30PM - Hang Out - Network Share this event:   @HUICentral Join HUI Central.com IMPORTANT : If you come to the event and you are not registered on the Meetup site by 3:00PM on the day of the Meetup, you will have to wait to the side to see if there's room to accommodate you.

Marc Sewtz  - APEX 5.1 - A Sneak Peek: We’re busy working on APEX 5.1 and it’s time to lift the curtain a little on the exciting new features coming in our next release. Joins us for a preview of the Interactive Grid and the new charting engine based on Oracle’s JET JavaScript library. Dan McGhan - Creating a Super LOV Item Using Native Components: It's an item. It's a report. No, it's Super LOV and it's one of the most heavily used plug-ins for APEX. But alas, it's not being maintained much these days and it doesn't work great in APEX 5.0. But is it even needed anymore? In this session I'll show you how to create a replacement for Super LOV using a Modal Dialog and an Interactive Report. The result is impressive! Also, we'll be giving away a free copy of the recently released book: Expert Oracle Application Express, 2nd Edition.

109790,133867,8271612,"228386430","Talk Abstract:  Data-driven discovery and innovation typically presupposes that the data will be there when you need it, but will it?  Without data infrastructure and attention to the stewardship and preservation of digital data, critical data on which we depend may become inaccessible or lost.  This is especially problematic for data generated by sponsored research projects where the focus is on innovation rather than infrastructure, and support for stewardship and preservation may be short-term.  In this talk, Fran Berman takes a holistic view of sustainability, infrastructure, and data, and discusses the challenges of creating a sustainable ecosystem for research data. 


About the presenter: Dr. Fran Berman is the U.S. Chair of the Research Data Alliance (rd-alliance.org) and Hamilton Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Her work has focused on the critical cyber- and social infrastructure needed for digital stewardship and preservation of the data that drives discovery and innovation.  Berman led the San Diego Supercomputer Center from[masked], focusing on the development of national infrastructure for data-intensive applications.  She subsequently co-chaired the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Sustainable Digital Preservation and Access, whose final report provided a deep dive into the economics of digital stewardship and preservation and has been downloaded more than 120,000 times.

Agenda Intro to NYAI - (Maxwell Rebo &amp; Kishan Bhoopalam)  Intersection of neuroscience and deep learning - (Russell Hanson)  In the lab he and his colleagues work on encodings of memory and learning in biological neural networks.  These encodings can be spike-dependent meaning that constant firing rate models for computer science/artificial intelligence lose some important behaviors in the twenty billion cortical neurons that make up the biological substrate of human cognition. Bio: Hanson is a professor of genetics at Mount Sinai Medical School in the Department of Genetics and Multiscale Biology.  He endeavors with a multi-disciplinary team to develop the necessary technologies to enable what we call a ""Brain Backup"" or non-destructive non-invasive connectome using tools from synthetic biology and imaging physics. http://russellhanson.com Visualizing what makes neural networks actually work - (Matthew Zeiler, Founder &amp; CEO of Clarifai Inc.)

We are hosting this first Meetup at the WordUp bookstore. It is a hippie dippy community library within walking distance of the medical center.  Like mentioned before, the goal is to create a laid back place where the spirit of the coffeehouse culture of the Enlightenment meets the modern day hackerspace. This is a place where people can freely and openly kick back and share ideas, write code, and contribute towards the learning and development of AI. All are welcomed. All that is required an open mind, a tolerance and respect for new ideas, and the daring to try something new.  CUMC is one of the world's leading research centers in the world, attracting some of the world's best minds to engage in breath taking research. Yet, it seems like there isn't much cross fertilization of ideas over what could potential revolutionize how science, our economy or society will work; no talk of artificial intelligence. It is also strange that although New York is the second best place for technology companies in the country, not much attention has paid been to CUMC. This meetup presents a great opportunity to finally begin to address these issues in a meaningful way. I am still working on the subject of this first meetup. Given the nature of AI, I am leaning towards asking two question: ""What are the ethics of AI?"" and ""What are some current advancements in AI?"", then see where it goes from there. As always, if you have a suggestion leave it in the discussion section. Thank you again for joining. Edit 2/11/2016:Shout out to Leila who suggested that the first question should be: ""Why your interest in AI?"". And so it shall be.","24 Feb 2016","19:00","2113 Amsterdam Ave New York",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

We are just about ready to release tickets to the 2016 New York R Conference!  We are going to have a great lineup again this year so stay tuned. About the talk: Often, fairly simple parametric models are preferable to complex machine learning methods. Two common examples are in time-series work, where the data are not independent and dependencies need to be modeled explicitly, and in causal research, where consistent estimates of the parameters themselves are the primary object of interest. Jim will discuss the usefulness of the Random Forest's proximity matrix in this sort of work. He will present two new methods:  - Proximity matching: A technique for building synthetic control groups for causal analysis on observational data. This method largely overcomes both the dimensionality issues and Smith-Todd critique of other matching methods. - Analogy weighting: A method for constructing weights to use in time-series models. This weighting scheme allows researchers to give weight to relevant periods of history and ignore irrelevant periods. In doing so, it frees modelers from having to decide on a look-back window for estimation. About Jim: Jim Savage is Data Science Lead at Lendable, a frontier markets finance start-up. He recently moved to NY from Australia, where he worked at a leading think-tank on pensions policies, and in macroeconomic modeling at the Australian Treasury. In 2014, he was a fellow at the University of Chicago's Data Science for Social Good fellowship (hurry! 2016 applications close soon).

It represents tremendous promise of using big data to transform business operations. Hadoop was developed as a solution for efficient and scalable search indexing need. The first version had MapReduce programming model. Mastering MapReduce required steep learning curve, and migrating applications to MapReduce needed a complete re-write. This along with the requirement of moving compute closer to data made MapReduce an impediment that did little to bolster productization of big data. There are faster in-memory substitutes to MapReduce, but they too carry the same baggage. In hindsight, Hadoop should have modeled itself as a distributed operating system, and enabled various programming models to run. Hadoop 2.0 (Yarn) was the answer. Not only does Yarn allow organizations to perform advanced analytics with data at unprecedented volume, but it’s also broadened the use cases for Big Data across the industry segments.What is now needed is bleeding edge Yarn-based platform capable of radically realizing Hadoop’s potential.These new age big data platforms must deliver real business value of the Big Data. This means easy deployment, ease of  integration with existing IT infrastructure, ease of migration and development of applications to Hadoop, and faster time to insight for business.The key requirements of this new platforms should reside in:  • Simplicity and Production-ready • Code Reuse • Operability • Ease of integration • Leveraging the power of Hadoop  In this webinar we will discuss Apache Apex (incubating), the next generation native Hadoop big data platform. We will go into details on how Apex meets these requirements.

In the middle of the Internet revolution, iCouldBe developed one of the earliest e-mentoring platforms designed to bring the power of mentoring to at-risk youth across the US. With 1.2 million youth dropping out of school each year, 16 million students in need of a mentor and high school students only receiving 10 minutes per year of guidance counseling, the US continues to face an educational crisis. Since 2000, iCouldBe’s e-mentoring program has served over 21,000 at-risk middle and high school students, empowering teens to stay in school, plan for future careers, and achieve in life. Students from public high schools across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, select their own mentors and work on e-mentoring activities that focus on academic success strategies, career exploration, and post-secondary educational and career planning. After attending a DataDive, iCouldBe began working with a team of DataCorps volunteers (Thomas Vincent, Peter Fleischman, Pooja Madan, and Matt Yin) to analyze their 15 years worth of data, including 130,000 anonymous mentor-mentee conversations, to understand how to define successful mentorship interactions. Hear from Wendy Siegelman, iCouldBe’s Chief Operating Officer, on how this work will help the organization better serve students in need of mentoring and to keep more students in school. Then, ask your own questions during a facilitated Q&amp;A. AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T Aspire, the company’s signature philanthropic initiative, support both DataKind and iCouldBe, so we are especially thankful that they are sponsoring this Meetup and providing the perfect space for a DataKind family reunion.

The second talk covers ingestion and egression of data into/from Hadoop using Nifi. The Nifi connectors are part of Apache Malhar library. 9:15pm - Toppling the mainframe: Enterprise-grade streaming under 2ms on Hadoop - Ilya Ganelin (Capital One Data Innovation Lab) 10:00pm - Q&amp;A 10:15pm - Integrating Apex and Apache NiFi by Bryan Bende (Hortonworks) 11:00pm - Q&amp;A Abstract - Toppling the mainframe: Enterprise-grade streaming under 2ms on Hadoop:   These days everyone is excited about big data and fast data. Capital One has embraced this new generation of technology with open arms. However, “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” For many years, there’s been a very real battle around the standard operating model of software. Tech giants like Oracle and IBM have traditionally built massively expensive enterprise-ready products, while the open source community provides free, albeit usually inferior, software. For a product to be enterprise-ready, it must guarantee complete reliability alongside performance and flexibility. We had not yet seen open source succeed in the realm of distributed stream computing. Capital One set out to find whether we could build or find enterprise-ready technology in the open source world to tackle difficult streaming problems that also provides equivalent performance, durability, and availability as a mainframe computer. Ilya Ganelin details Capital One’s attempt to answer this question in a rigorous and complete way, not just by making a prototype or discovering exciting new tools, but by creating an open source-based, enterprise-ready product that can transparently replace an enormously expensive proprietary solution. Ilya presents Capital One’s novel solution for real-time decisioning on Apache Apex. Topics include: - A detailed dive into the business requirements of a new real-time decisioning platform for model building, feature computation, and model scoring. - A survey and analysis of the leading open source technologies for stream processing and what tradeoffs Capital One considered when selecting their technology stack. - Capital One’s solution, based on Apache Apex, which provides unparalleled performance on Hadoop and meets the stringent performance, scalability, and durability requirements necessary for enterprise-grade decision making Bio: Ilya Ganelin is a roboticist turned data engineer. After a few years building self-discovering robots at the University of Michigan and another few years working on embedded DSP software with cell phones and radios at Boeing, he landed in the world of big data at the Capital One Data Innovation Lab. Ilya is an active contributor to the core components of Apache Spark and a committer to Apache Apex with the goal of learning what it takes to build a next-generation distributed computing platform. Ilya is an avid bread maker, cook, skier, and race-car driver. Abstract - Integrating Apex and Apache NiFi In this talk we will give an overview of Apache NiFi and how it can be used to bring data to an analytic platform like Apache Apex. Specifically we’ll discuss the details of the NiFi input and output operators that were developed for the Apache Apex Malhar library, and talk through use-cases for integrating the two technologies. Bio: Bryan Bende is a Member of the Technical Staff at Hortonworks where he develops dataflow capabilities around the core framework of Apache NiFi, and has over ten years of experience developing enterprise software solutions.

You are also more than welcome to bring your own stuff to work on or share.  I'm always interested to see if there are others out there working on fully automated trading algorithms, particularly those in the industry or trading at scale.  As usual though, the event will be fairly casual and more hangout-oriented, so those looking for something more lecture or workshop oriented should look elsewhere.

They'll be hosted by Audible in their downtown Newark office. The talk will be given by Donn Felker, a Google Developer Expert on Android. Abstract: Learn about the new mobile database on the block, Realm. With Realm you work with regular Java objects - not SQL, cursors or object mappers. These same Java objects are native to Realm. Learn how to use Realm and its reactive features to build apps faster and more efficiently without having to write a line of SQL. You'll leave with a firm understanding of how to install, setup, store and retrieve data with a Realm database. When you get back to the office you can use Realm to help you focus on solving a business problem instead of worrying about how to get your data in and out of a database.

112104,136861,18334914,"229118148","Since last year, the XPRIZE Think Tank has hosted in-depth discussions around exponential technologies and global challenges. We’ve personally watched the group grow in passion and excitement, which makes this announcement that much more fulfilling. Every month starting from March, the Think Tank will propose a moonshot challenge for all interested members and participants to solve. Each month will kick off a 4-week incubation period that will nurture any and all ideas that tackle the monthly challenge into viable product plans. You'll be provided with valuable resources, network, and guidance on every step of the way, so you will never feel like you are solving this alone. This month of March, we’re going to be investigating the topic of Urban Farming. Along with Think Tank leaders and a local entrepreneur making waves in NYC urban farming, you’ll be able to learn about this area of emerging technology as well as creating a solution that could revolutionize it. The challenge that we’re proposing is the following: Create a solution that makes vegetative urban farming fun, accessible, and financially feasible for the average NYC resident, while supporting the city’s impoverished and promoting environmental sustainability.  There are 5 parts to this challenge explained: Fun: Right now urban farming is considered a ‘nice to have’ niche. But as you will learn at this event, the idea of growing one’s produce can involve something very different than the perceived inconvenience of managing your own produce. Accessible: Your solution should be easily accessible by the average NYC resident. No expensive equipment or complex assembly/maintenance please!  Financially feasible: The only way that urban farming can gain traction in a city like NYC is through business incentives. Commercial models and cost saving measures will offer us the first two major areas of improvement when it comes to grocery shopping and food access. Supporting the impoverished: Urban farming can provide a potentially limitless source of food for a city setting. We believe that those who currently lack access to fresh, nutritious produce will greatly benefit from this abundance. Promoting environmental sustainability:  By growing food in our own urban backyard, we can significantly reduce carbon emission due to external food transportation and more efficient means of production. So, if you want to learn more about urban farming, create an innovative and effective solution to this challenge from scratch, and make impact in NYC (and the greater world of course), definitely show up this Tuesday!! We'll have brainstorming session and assemble teams based on the qualities of the idea from the brainstorms. At the end of March, there will be a Think Tank Pitchfest, where all participating teams pitch their hashed-out idea/product plan to the audience and a panel of judges, which may include potential investors and industry experts.  We’ll provide more details over the coming weeks. Let's make it happen. See you soon! The Think Tank Team

In contrast, I'll discuss visualization techniques that depict more of the underlying data to reveal insights that may be otherwise overlooked.  Techniques will include directly plotting millions to billions of data points; as well as augmenting familiar representations with additional visual layers of data, such as text analytics.  Examples will include millions of tweets about Donald Trump, stock markets, health maps, and more from both research and industry. A few pointers to open source tools will be included. Bio: Richard Brath has been involved in the design and development of interactive visualization for the last 25 years. These include the first interactive 3D financial visualization on the web (1996) and other early visualizations; to a wide variety of visualizations in use today by hundreds of thousands of users.

Paul Randal will be presenting on: Index Fragmentation: Internals, Analysis, and Solutions As soon as you have more than one index on a table, you're going to start seeing fragmentation. Many people know that this fragmentation is bad, but why is it bad? And what is the best way to get rid of it? Come find out from the person who wrote the tools for detecting and removing index fragmentation. In this session, you’ll learn how fragmentation occurs and why the process that leads to it can often be as damaging to performance as the fragmentation itself. You'll also learn how to test for fragmentation, the different methods of removing it, and everything you need to consider when putting together an appropriate fragmentation-management strategy. About Paul:Paul is a Microsoft SQL Server MVP and a Microsoft Regional Director. He spent 9 years working on the SQL Server team, writing DBCC CHECKDB, and ultimately responsible for the entire Storage Engine.

Day and time to be announced.  As of February 2016, Daniel Narey is taking over the reigns as lead organizer of the group. In an effort to transition the group to a member-driven and self-sustaining organization, Daniel is looking to recruit 3 to 5 people to join him as the 2016 Leadership Team. The outside time commitment will be minimal, but members of the Leadership Team will be expected to attend a one-hour planning meeting each month, and each member will have the opportunity to take the lead in organizing one event for 2016.   While this initial spring meeting is open to all, it will be of particular interest to those who would like to take part in shaping what we do over the next year. Daniel has a few ideas in mind for growing participation, but he needs your input and feedback. Here are some things he has been thinking about: • Workshops exploring the intersection of data with design—in particular, designing for user interaction with data • Training opportunities for people who want to learn particular data visualization frameworks and tools (e.g., d3 for JavaScript, ggplot2 for R, matplotlib for Python, Tableau for non-coders) • Collaboration on a project to use data visualization for social good Please feel free to contact Daniel with any questions you may have or ideas you would like to bring to the group.

113962,137641,18212345,"228870888","Please join us for a fun, inclusive one-day event that brings together diverse communities to create and improve Wikipedia articles related to women in the arts. Despite its wide reach, Wikipedia suffers from a severe gender gap: only about 15% of editors are women. In response, diverse women and allies are joining together to celebrate women’s cultural achievements and inspire a new generation of women Wikipedians. OpenPittsburgh is partnering with Art+Feminism (http://artandfeminismpgh.com/) for this event, which coincides with Code for America's Code Across weekend, and International Open Data Day. The event will also serve as a primer on editing Wikipedia, one of the most wide-reaching and often-used institutions of our time. No prior experience necessary. Please register on Eventbrite https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artfeminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-frick-fine-arts-tickets-21135013394?aff=es2 You can also sign your name to our Wikipedia Meetup registration. (Yes, you still have to register on Eventbrite. The Eventbrite will provide us with information to help our planning, and the wikipedia registration will allow us to track how many of the day's edits ""stick"" over time) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Pittsburgh/ArtAndFeminism_2016/University_of_Pittsburgh The Edit-A-Thon still needs a few volunteers, of a variety of technical experience. Volunteers can also participate - shifts are 2-3 hours each, out of a day-long event. Folks interested in volunteering as Greeters, Technical Fascilitators, or Floating Helpers should email alexandra.oliver[at]gmail[dot]com directly. Why so many registration pages?This event has a lot of stakeholders, and registration details are important both for the planning of the event, and for retrospective data about the Edit-A-Thon's impact over time. I’ve never edited Wikipedia before. Is this event really beginner-friendly?Yes! No knowledge of Wikipedia is assumed. I don’t know anything about art or feminism. Can I still participate?Yes! We will have lists of “to do’s” including sourcing, research, editing for spelling/grammar, verifying references, linking and other important general improvements to help make Wikipedia great. We'll also have resources and librarians on hand to help you get started. Are men welcome?Yes. People of all gender expressions and sexual orientations are welcome. We expect that all participants, regardless of their preferred pronoun or identification, will support us in creating a safe, respectful, and woman-positive environment. If you have any questions about this, please ask! Confidentiality respected. What do you mean by “arts” here?“Arts” is conceived broadly to encompass music, design, architecture, visual and performing arts, literature and more. Is childcare available?We are working on securing childcare (off-site, but easily accessible from the venue). Please select a ""child"" ticket for each child for whom you are seeking care, and we will be in touch with more details in advance of the event. Do you have to be a Pitt student or university community member to participate?No. This is not a university event; the university is just our generous host.

Overview of the learning session Data visualization involves the presentation of data in a graphical format with the goal of communicating information more clearly and efficiently to audiences. This session will focus on dashboards. Dashboards provide a visual display of your program’s or organization’s status. They are valuable because they quickly provide information about areas of strength and challenge, and all necessary information is available in one convenient location. During the session, Taj and Dana will talk about the basics of developing a dashboard and how to select the best medium for the visual presentation of your data (i.e., should it be a static document, or an interactive and dynamic dashboard?) They will also provide examples of dashboards and talk about aspects of DataViz design that work for programs of all varieties. Bios of Presenters Taj Carson, PhD is the CEO and founder of Carson Research Consulting (CRC), where she oversees all aspects of CRC.

115628,141429,4379272,"228440768","Rough agenda:  6 - 6:30: Networking and Pizza 6:30 - 7:30: Three Speakers (1) Eric Miller, professor, Tufts University. ""Perspectives on Computational Sensing: Physics, Data, and Uncertainty"" Abstract: Characterizing the internal structure of a region of space in a noninvasive manner arises across a wide range of applications.  Common to all of these problems are challenges associated with (a) the physics of the sensing modality or modalities; (b)  the nature of the data, sometimes big, sometimes small, frequently insufficient; and (c) and systematic uncertainty associated with the sensor system itself or the medium under investigation.  This talk will focus on a discussion of these issues, how they intersect, and methods for addressing them in the context of four problems: hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography, subsurface contaminant source zone characterization, satellite remote sensing, and X-ray CT for airport security scanning. (2) Rob Holt, inviCRO, LLC. ""Medical Image Analysis for Drug Discovery and Validation"" Abstract: Medical images are used for more than diagnosing disease.  The pharmaceutical industry relies on high-volume, high-throughput small animal medical imaging to make decisions in the drug production pipeline.  Early recognition of the failure of a drug can save a company millions and prevent the undue loss of life and well-being through over-testing.  Quantitation can come from a variety of sources, but is mostly done through longitudinal tracking of biomarkers among control and treatment cohorts of animals.  The image contrast comes from across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, each with its own challenges and advantages.  From idea to implementation, from mouse to man, inviCRO supports drug development through quantitative analysis of medical images using cutting-edge and proprietary analysis algorithms. (3) Allen Goodman, Broad Insitute of Harvard and MIT. ""imaged: A distributed storage and retrieval store for microscopy images"" Abstract: imaged (im·aged or image·d) is a distributed storage and retrieval store for microscopy images. It's more affordable and available than the archetypical system of network attached storage (NAS) appliances running the network file system (NFS). We've made two key observations: first, by coupling conflict resolution, key-value lookup, and version control, availability is guaranteed by accepting inconsistency under minor failure modes; second, since most disk operations are metadata lookups, by reducing per-image metadata, machines can perform metadata lookups in memory, which conserves disk operations for reading data, thereby increasing overall throughput.

THANKS! https://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-boston-2016-tickets-20590413481 --- Please join Code for Boston for a weekend of civic hacking, youth mentorship, and code education at our third annual CodeAcross event on March 5-6, 2015 at the Roxbury Innovation Center. Our goal for this year's CodeAcross is to start building the next generation of civic hackers through a curated, educational hackathon. Pretty cool, right?! To do this, Code for Boston is partnering with Resilient Coders, a code education non-profit focused on underserved youth, on what we're calling a progression hackathon: a structured hacking event where novice coders and students work in teams with experienced software developers and designers on hacakathon projects, and learn fundamental dev skills like ideation and wireframing, Github and source control, and more through a series of fast-paced, educational workshops. At CodeAcross, we'll bring together civic technologists, community organizations, and local businesses to work collaboratively on projects around career building, equity, and economic development. Although this year's event is more focused on technology than our usual events, CodeAcross will always be open to the entire community: Community involvement and inclusion are extremely important to us, and our best projects always have a mix of technical and non-technical team members. We can't wait to see you all for a couple days of learning, teaching, collaborating, and civic hacking!  CodeAcross would not be possible without the generosity of the following organizations:   http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130910/SF76762LOGO","05 Mar 2016","10:00","2300 Washington Street Boston",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

However, as anyone who has been in the trenches of data sciences knows, the large majority of their time is spent doing data gathering, data wrangling, data cleaning and yes - linking data from heterogeneous datasets!  In 2001, a seminal paper in scientific american changed the way many data driven scientists search for and publish data. It has also created an entire new discipline within computer sciences. iSemantics, ESWC, ISWC, SWAT4LS are shining examples of this. Fifteen years later, there are massive amounts of Linked Data all over the web. In this talk, I will attempt to explore how the Semantic Web/Linked Data community can better support Data Scientists in the world of health care and life sciences. https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n57kr6313rYX3IBEdVuOoCt_FAcNOmaVXohqQq7mORgy8zZSpm9ksojPRf52wRRbYJBSxasO9CZBPE74qdQ52jL0nlrtWKAp67weiXLG7Nbgds6V71YxxjwP2F9OOFVNOPGHKCM Helena Deus is Associate Director at Foundation Medicine, where she leads a team of data scientists and engineers tasked with data integration, data management, query parallelisation, data reuse and data mining for the facilitation of medical knowledge insights. As a data scientist focused on the intersection of oncology and molecular biology, she is dedicated to researching and pioneering IT solutions for precision medicine data fusion and data interpretation problems. Helena received her PhD in Bioinformatics from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa.","08 Mar 2016","18:00","32 Vassar Street Cambridge",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

However, sometimes people don’t feel comfortable answering a researcher’s questions with complete honesty. Other times they may not know exactly how to articulate what they need, want, or feel. We will examine findings from psychology and market research to understand techniques for interviews to help you uncover insights beyond people’s surficial answers. We’ll explore conversation theory, projective techniques such as image associations, collaging, sentence completion, and others to uncover hidden, actionable insights to fuel your designs.  After starting a career in geophysics, Susan discovered that she enjoyed visually communicating her data more than she enjoyed researching the science. She has over 20 years of expertise in user experience, working both as a consultant and in-house designer and researcher. She has several years of experience in conducting user research, using a diverse set of research methods from contextual inquiry to ethnography to collaging across industries.

However, a parallel set of methodologies have been developed that use rules to create effective predictions (e.g. Quinlan (1992) and Quinlan (1993)). Many of these models are not well known and have not undergone significant peer review but are nonetheless very powerful. Recent developments are bringing a revival of these models.

117106,141794,9505222,"228978344","Today's analytics applications must not only be capable of handling ever increasing types of data (Variety), they need to do it in near real time (Velocity). Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity).  These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business. This type of hybrid cloud, near real time analytic application requires streaming analytics capabilities, messaging systems and secure gateways to integrate cloud and on-premise systems. In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop. We will explore the various technology components used in this application as well as demonstrate how they integrate in an end-to-end application flow. We will also do a deep dive into the Spark Streaming application itself.

This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.

Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions.

Agenda: • 530-6pm Food, drinks and Networking • 6-7pm Apache Kudu presentation • 7-730pm Networking Speaker bio:  Todd Lipcon is an engineer at Cloudera, where he primarily contributes to open source distributed systems in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. He is a committer and a PMC member on the Apache Hadoop, HBase, and Thrift projects. Prior to Cloudera, Todd worked on web infrastructure at several startups and researched novel machine-learning methods for collaborative filtering. Todd received his bachelor’s degree with honors from Brown University. Introduction to Apache Kudu Over the past several years, the Hadoop ecosystem has made great strides in its real-time access capabilities, narrowing the gap compared to traditional database technologies. With systems such as Impala and Spark, analysts can now run complex queries or jobs over large datasets within a matter of seconds. With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets. Despite these advances, some important gaps remain that prevent many applications from transitioning to Hadoop-based architectures. Users are often caught between a rock and a hard place: columnar formats such as Apache Parquet offer extremely fast scan rates for analytics, but little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access. Online systems such as HBase offer very fast random access, but scan rates that are too slow for large scale data warehousing workloads. This talk will investigate the trade-offs between real-time transactional access and fast analytic performance from the perspective of storage engine internals. It will also describe and demo Apache Kudu, the new addition to the open source Hadoop ecosystem that fills the gap described above, complementing HDFS and HBase to provide a new option to achieve fast scans and fast random access from a single API.","17 Mar 2016","17:30","One Marina Park Drive, Suite 400 Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Agenda:  • 530-6pm Food, drinks and Networking • 6-7pm Apache Kudu presentation • 7-730pm Networking Speaker bio:  Todd Lipcon is an engineer at Cloudera, where he primarily contributes to open source distributed systems in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. He is a committer and a PMC member on the Apache Hadoop, HBase, and Thrift projects. Prior to Cloudera, Todd worked on web infrastructure at several startups and researched novel machine-learning methods for collaborative filtering. Todd received his bachelor’s degree with honors from Brown University. Introduction to Apache Kudu:  Over the past several years, the Hadoop ecosystem has made great strides in its real-time access capabilities, narrowing the gap compared to traditional database technologies. With systems such as Impala and Spark, analysts can now run complex queries or jobs over large datasets within a matter of seconds. With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets. Despite these advances, some important gaps remain that prevent many applications from transitioning to Hadoop-based architectures. Users are often caught between a rock and a hard place: columnar formats such as Apache Parquet offer extremely fast scan rates for analytics, but little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access. Online systems such as HBase offer very fast random access, but scan rates that are too slow for large scale data warehousing workloads. This talk will investigate the trade-offs between real-time transactional access and fast analytic performance from the perspective of storage engine internals. It will also describe and demo Apache Kudu, the new addition to the open source Hadoop ecosystem that fills the gap described above, complementing HDFS and HBase to provide a new option to achieve fast scans and fast random access from a single API.","17 Mar 2016","17:30","One Marina Park Drive, Suite 400 Boston",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Our mission is to bring together a multidisciplinary audience spanning academia and industry providing exposure and insight into the life science advancements changing our world. March 2016 will kick off a series of SHOW events focused on the science and the art of building dynamic network relationships. Although research plays a key role in driving innovation, relationships also play an important part in creating the necessary opportunities to bring about extraordinary and dynamic change in science and medicine. Strong professional networks can be advantageous in all areas such as nucleating novel research collaborations, business development opportunities, new venture creation, professional development and/or career advancement. Networks within your area of expertise or business are powerful but even more powerful are networks that break down verticals and bridge silos, such as academia vs industry. As hybrid skills and diverse relationships grow in demand, how can we gain this expertise and build these relationships –&gt; by networking with diverse people outside of your field…. which is easier said than done! Leading March’s SHOW event will be career strategist extraordinaire, Sarah Cardozo Duncan. Sarah is an accomplished networker who will be sharing her knowledge and insight on relationship building and strategy. Following the introduction, the remainder of the evening will be an opportunity to put Sarah’s strategies into action, meet new colleagues from outside of your field/outside of your industry, and enrich your network of relationships.

Elasticsearch at Datadog AbstractDatadog is a SaaS-based infrastructure monitoring company. We process billions of data points every day including metrics and events. Metrics are things like CPU utilization, database keys, queue lengths and more. Events are more varied and include completed Chef job notifications, GitHub commits, and Docker container status. Storing this information and being able to make use of it in our Stream and our Dashboards is challenging. We started with Postgres like many of you probably did. But as our needs grew, we moved to various configurations of Elastic, learning as we went. Elastic is now a core component in how we can do what we do, indexing vast numbers of events every second. In this talk, you will see how Datadog uses an Elastic cluster to create a fast and efficient environment for thousands of customers and how we keep an eye on it to ensure it stays that way. Speaker BioMatt Williams is the DevOps Evangelist at Datadog. He is passionate about the power of monitoring and metrics to make large-scale systems stable and manageable. So he tours the country speaking and writing about monitoring with Datadog. When he's not on the road, he's coding.

What could be left? The rise of “open core” products (commercial products which use open source projects at their core) has made it possible for open source projects to both thrive and help businesses grow. We will take a look at a product from the commercial sponsor of Solr: Lucidworks Fusion. From its driving motivation to its architecture Fusion is meant to increase the adoption of Solr even as it makes it easier to accomplish many of the things that Solr does best. From connectors, to visualizations, to security, we will discuss how a product like Fusion will help drive the further adoption of Solr now and in the future. Carlos Valcarcel has been a search geek since 2007 when he accepted a position at Fast Search and Transfer just prior to Fast being acquired by Microsoft. He has been an independent consultant, developer, and distributed systems architect for more years than he cares to think about. Solr as a Graph Database using the Graph Query This is an overview of the new Solr Graph Query. We will discuss the semantics of this new query operator in Lucene/Solr and how it can be used to solve real world knowledge graph problems. In addition, we will cover how to handle data that is a graph in nature and discuss items such as social networking search, recommendation engines, security filtering, and how to use knowledge graphs and ontologies to draw conclusions, all using the Solr Graph query. Kevin Watters has been working with search engines since 2002 where he was a Senior Solution Architect at FAST and subsequently a Principal Engineer at Attivio.

In the 30 seconds that it takes you to read this, Answers will have processed over 30 million events in support of its actionable, insightful, and real-time mobile analytics dashboards. Real-time analytics are becoming increasingly important to understanding how users are using your mobile applications, and the amount of data created by mobile devices is increasing rapidly. In this talk, you'll learn how Answers leverages the lambda architecture and probabilistic algorithms to handle this torrent of information. We'll dive into how Answers uses Twitter’s new stream-processing technology, Heron, to efficiently process all that information with improved reliability, performance, and operability compared to other stream processing technologies. We’ll give a personal account of migrating from using Storm to using Heron for processing mobile events and the benefits we’ve seen so far.

They'll be hosted by Audible in their downtown Newark office. The talk will be given by Donn Felker, a Google Developer Expert on Android. Abstract: Learn about the new mobile database on the block, Realm. With Realm you work with regular Java objects - not SQL, cursors or object mappers. These same Java objects are native to Realm. Learn how to use Realm and its reactive features to build apps faster and more efficiently without having to write a line of SQL. You'll leave with a firm understanding of how to install, setup, store and retrieve data with a Realm database. When you get back to the office you can use Realm to help you focus on solving a business problem instead of worrying about how to get your data in and out of a database.

119007,156295,18334914,"229118148","Since last year, the XPRIZE Think Tank has hosted in-depth discussions around exponential technologies and global challenges. We’ve personally watched the group grow in passion and excitement, which makes this announcement that much more fulfilling. Every month starting from March, the Think Tank will propose a moonshot challenge for all interested members and participants to solve. Each month will kick off a 4-week incubation period that will nurture any and all ideas that tackle the monthly challenge into viable product plans. You'll be provided with valuable resources, network, and guidance on every step of the way, so you will never feel like you are solving this alone. This month of March, we’re going to be investigating the topic of Urban Farming. Along with Think Tank leaders and a local entrepreneur making waves in NYC urban farming, you’ll be able to learn about this area of emerging technology as well as creating a solution that could revolutionize it. The challenge that we’re proposing is the following: Create a solution that makes vegetative urban farming fun, accessible, and financially feasible for the average NYC resident, while supporting the city’s impoverished and promoting environmental sustainability.  There are 5 parts to this challenge explained: Fun: Right now urban farming is considered a ‘nice to have’ niche. But as you will learn at this event, the idea of growing one’s produce can involve something very different than the perceived inconvenience of managing your own produce. Accessible: Your solution should be easily accessible by the average NYC resident. No expensive equipment or complex assembly/maintenance please!  Financially feasible: The only way that urban farming can gain traction in a city like NYC is through business incentives. Commercial models and cost saving measures will offer us the first two major areas of improvement when it comes to grocery shopping and food access. Supporting the impoverished: Urban farming can provide a potentially limitless source of food for a city setting. We believe that those who currently lack access to fresh, nutritious produce will greatly benefit from this abundance. Promoting environmental sustainability:  By growing food in our own urban backyard, we can significantly reduce carbon emission due to external food transportation and more efficient means of production. So, if you want to learn more about urban farming, create an innovative and effective solution to this challenge from scratch, and make impact in NYC (and the greater world of course), definitely show up this Tuesday!! We'll have brainstorming session and assemble teams based on the qualities of the idea from the brainstorms. At the end of March, there will be a Think Tank Pitchfest, where all participating teams pitch their hashed-out idea/product plan to the audience and a panel of judges, which may include potential investors and industry experts.  We’ll provide more details over the coming weeks. Let's make it happen. See you soon! The Think Tank Team

In contrast, I'll discuss visualization techniques that depict more of the underlying data to reveal insights that may be otherwise overlooked.  Techniques will include directly plotting millions to billions of data points; as well as augmenting familiar representations with additional visual layers of data, such as text analytics.  Examples will include millions of tweets about Donald Trump, stock markets, health maps, and more from both research and industry. A few pointers to open source tools will be included. Bio: Richard Brath has been involved in the design and development of interactive visualization for the last 25 years. These include the first interactive 3D financial visualization on the web (1996) and other early visualizations; to a wide variety of visualizations in use today by hundreds of thousands of users. Together with David Jonker, Richard published Graph Analysis and Visualization with Wiley books (2015). Richard is a partner at Uncharted Software. He has degrees in both design and software and remains active in visualization research including an in-progress PhD in visualization. ","02 Mar 2016","18:30","55 East 52nd Street New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

At its core is a stream processing engine that enables development of highly performant, fully scalable and completely fault tolerant enterprise grade applications on Hadoop. It is in production use in various industries where real time performance and fault tolerance are critical. It also comes with rich set of functional building blocks and an easy to use API for the developers to build real-time and batch applications. Apex applications are multi-tenant and run natively on YARN and HDFS alongside your other Hadoop applications. DataTorrent Inc was the initial developer of Apex and contributed it to the Apache Foundation. It continues to be actively involved in the development of Apache Apex and offers an enterprise edition of Apex. In this talk you will learn about Apex, the different features and functionality it offers and the architectural overview. You will also see demo applications and in this context see the tools provided by the DataTorrent enterprise edition. You will also see hands-on development of an Apex application from scratch in Java and see it running in Hadoop.  Presenter: Pramod Immaneni is Apache Apex (incubating) PPMC member, committer and senior architect at DataTorrent Inc, where he works on Apex and specializes in big data applications. Prior to DataTorrent he was a co-founder and CTO of Leaf Networks LLC, eventually acquired by Netgear Inc, where he built products in core networking space and was granted patents in peer-to-peer VPNs.

He is particularly interested in building systems that are both high performance and highly scalable and his favorite quote is “You can have a second computer once you’ve shown you know how to use the first one”","03 Mar 2016","18:00","55 East 52nd Street, McKinsey & Co. 21st Floor Conference Center New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Project 2: Improving Home Depot Search Relevance by Amy Ma, Brett Amdur, Christopher Redino Given only raw text as input, our goal is to predict the relevancy of products to search results at the Home Depot website. Our strategy is a little different from most other teams in this Kaggle competition, where we generated a work flow that starts from text cleaning, passes through feature engineering and ends with model selection and parameter tuning in attempt to stand out among thousands of competitors. 

Project 3: Predicting Customer Satisfaction at Santander Bank from Anonymized Data by Anna Bohun, Thomas Boulenger, Adam Owens &amp; Ashwin Swamy As part of an ongoing Kaggle competition, NYCDSA Data Scientists tackle Santander Bank’s question of how to identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Santander aims to take proactive steps to improve their customers' happiness, but faces a major roadblock in trying to make sense out of information that has been anonymized to protect customer privacy. This issue is common in retail today -- how can retailers cater to customers without knowing who they are? The Data Scientists designed and engineered a data balancing neural network and compared it to popular gradient boosted machine algorithms. The data scientists will touch on the importance of feature engineering, dimensional reduction, and computational efficiency. The results provide interesting insights into the complications of neural network precision and the operational efficiency of gradient boosted machines.","28 Mar 2016","18:30","500 8th Ave, Suite 905 New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

It is a low-cost, scalable method of performing citywide street quality measurements. Our speaker, Varun Adibhatla, will also discuss ARGO Lab's civic data science framework i.e. integrating device, data and decision-making towards urban tech solutions. 


 Varun Adibhatla [@vr00n] is a founding member at ARGO Labs, a civic data science organization that rapidly prototypes around device, data and decision-making towards delivering new solutions for old city problems. ARGO's Team built Street Quality Identification Device or SQUID - a low-cost sensor platform that when mounted on city vehicles can perform citywide street surveys by integrating accelerometer data with images and empowers end users to prioritize street repairs and work towards preventative maintenance by using a complete dataset as opposed to 311/citizen reported data. With over $1.6 billion projected over 10 yrs in spending on street surfacing, Varun will demonstrate how SQUID is a scalable and sustainable way for NYC and other cities to make more informed and optimize decisions around street resurfacing. SQUID is a grant recipient of the Knight foundation's 2015 Prototyping Fund and was also a finalist at the 2015 NYC BIG APPS, Connected Cities category. Varun is a recent graduate of NYU CUSP's Master's program in Urban Informatics. He also has a master's degree in Information Sciences from Penn State studying Human Computer Interaction.","28 Mar 2016","18:30","15 Metrotech Center, 19th Floor Brooklyn",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Topic:  Shapeless, cats, kittens and the power of generic functional programming This short talk will give: a quick introduction to shapeless (generic programing) and cats (functional programming), some example of kittens in practice to demonstrate the combination of the two, a brief introduction to Henkan – a project that provides type safe generic transformation built on top of these three projects.  Bio: Kailuo Wang is a software engineer with 12 years of experience in full-stack development. He is passionate about building elegant software solutions, film photography and free learning through open courses. He is also a devoted OSS developer. Projects that he recently contributed to include a) Akka, b) Kittens – generic programming with the power cats and shapeless, c) Kanaloa – a set of reactive work dispatchers, d) play–swagger – automatic swagger spec generation without code pollution and some minor contribution to shapeless and cats.  Topic: Akka Streams in Production: Dispatches From the Trenches The Akka Streams &amp; HTTP modules provide robust APIs for creating reactive microservices while requiring a small code footprint.  However, they can be tricky to wrestle with at times.  Many, seemingly easy, programming tasks don't have a prima facie solution that is concise.  This presentation will work through a collated set of common problems that developers come across when using Streams &amp; HTTP in the real world.  Bio:  Ramon Romero y Vigil has spent his entire career working in the distributed computing field solving large numeric problems.  He started off in high performance computing at Los Alamos National Labs then migrated to the financial sector, initially working on real time signal analysis systems in the hedge fund space.  For the past 13 years he has been a quantitative portfolio trader utilizing clustered computing at two investment banks.  Ramon earned a bachelor’s degree in Computational Mathematics from MIT in 2001.","29 Mar 2016","18:30","110 Fifth Avenue, Fifth Floor New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Datadog is a monitoring service that collects and processes hundreds of billions of data points every day from web servers, databases, cloud providers, and other infrastructural components. Outlier and anomaly detection helps users make sense of the flood of data coming from their systems and to identify deviations from normal levels, even when ""normal"" fluctuates over time. Homin will discuss the lessons that his team has learned from using these alerts on their own systems, along with some real-life examples on how to avoid false positives and negatives.

122353,147529,18966042,"228791552","This month we have two exciting talks planned, what's more we're partnering with the NY Cassandra meetup! Introducing Reactive Machine Learning by Jeff Smith Apache Cassandra Introduction and What's new in 3.0 by Jake Luciani 



----------------------------------------- 


Introducing Reactive Machine Learning  The worlds of reactive systems and machine learning are starting to come together in a really exciting way. Since the publishing of the reactive manifesto, developers in all sorts of different domains have started using this more principled approach to building systems that remain responsive in the face of faults or changes in scale. They’ve quickly built up an exciting toolbox of techniques, frameworks, and libraries that can be brought to bear on the challenges of build a reactive system.  The machine learning world has begun to notice this exciting development. Developers building these systems have huge amounts of data and tough problems. The reactive systems paradigm offers real answers for these problems.  This talk will introduce you to some ways in which reactive techniques can be applied to building machine learning systems. We’ll explore the five components of a machine learning system in sequence, trying to understand how and where reactive techniques can be applied. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we’ll be able to draw on technologies like NoSQL databases, Spark, and Akka to build these systems in a reactive manner.  Whether you’re experienced with reactive systems, machine learning systems, both, or neither, this talk will help introduce you to the big problems and some of the exciting new solutions in the union of reactive and machine learning.  Bio  Jeff Smith builds large-scale machine learning systems using Scala and Spark as part of that builds Amy, the AI that powers x.ai. For the past decade, he has been working on data science applications at various startups in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. He is a frequent speaker, active blogger, and the author of “Reactive Machine Learning Systems,” an upcoming book from Manning on how to build real world machine learning systems using Scala, Akka, and Spark.","08 Mar 2016","19:00","6th Floor, 675 Avenue of the Americas New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

We're on to Week 2 in this month's Think Tank Challenge! Last week we identified several areas of expansion in the urban farming arena, including: 


• Personal farming vs. Community farming • Choosing plants based on nutritional density • Repurposing excess space (basements, attics, crawlspaces) for farming • Different Plant Purposes: (1) Air Filtering (2) Water Filtering (3) Farming (4) Cooling • Food sharing apps &amp; related regulations/quality control • Aesthetic vs. Non-Aesthetic farming solutions 



The agenda is packed with some very specific questions, and there's no one better than David Marini, founder of Art of Aquaponics, to help guide our discussion as we get closer to the details. David is an entrepreneur and certified in urban farming, and he's joined the Think Tank as both a member and our featured Urban Farming Expert Mentor. The goal of this event is to identify at least one distinct solution to the month's challenge, which we'll develop over the coming weeks to compete and move on to business validation &amp; incubation stages. Weren't able to make it to Week 1?  No worries! We're going to recap everything at the beginning of this week's event so everyone is on the same page.  Make sure you send in your RSVP and invite a friend - see you Tuesday! -Dan &amp; The Think Tank Team

While the drivers helped in providing some common functionality for all frameworks (master detection, authentication, validation etc), they have several drawbacks. Frameworks need to depend on a native library which makes their build/deploy process cumbersome. The need for bi-directional connections makes it hard for schedulers to run in containers or behind firewalls. The Mesos API is undocumented which makes it really hard for pure language frameworks to use off-the-shelf HTTP libraries to interact with it. This talk will give an overview of the new v1 Framework API that addresses the above concerns. In particular the focus will be on the motivation, design and implementation of the API, as well as pointers to reference implementations and examples for framework writers and operators. Bio Vinod Kone is an Engineer at Mesosphere working on the Mesos core team. He is also a committer and on the PMC for Apache Mesos and Mesos Jenkins plugin. Previously, he was a Tech Lead for the Mesos team at Twitter. His interests lie in distributed systems and developer productivity.","09 Mar 2016","18:30"," ",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

While the 311 system empowers residents to participate in public service delivery, analysts frequently misinterpret call patterns as accurately reflecting need without accounting for individuals’ propensity to call. This confusion can cause city resources to be directed away from areas of greatest need when officials are pressured to reduce call rates. Since no one surveys 311 callers, we do the next best thing. We use government data and Stan to model how residents use 311. This allows us to identify which residents are more or less likely to call and evaluate whether reducing call rates promotes the equitable distribution of City resources.

Before starting his PhD at Columbia University's Department of Statistics, he worked at the CUNY Center for Urban Research and New York City’s legislature, the City Council.

One central question is how well we can predict student responses. In this talk, Ruben Naeff discusses such traditional methods as Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory and compares the result of Bayesian optimization with a graph-theoretical algorithm based on tournament ranking that approximates an upper bound to both traditional models’ single interaction prediction accuracy.  Check out a related blog post and Ruben's NIPS paper for more information.   Ruben NaeffData Scientist, Knewton Ruben is from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where he studied mathematics and worked as a strategy consultant and economic researcher.

In Week 1, we had an open brainstorm surrounding the problems, technology, and potential solutions in the urban agriculture industry. In Week 2, we discussed the proposed solutions from Week 1 in a little more detail. David Marini, founder of Art of Aquaponics, joined us to add creativity and insight into specific questions. We aimed the discussion at  • Tackling the general public's sentiment toward urban farming • Possibilities between food sharing apps (whether on financial or barter systems) • Taking advantage of the inefficiency of wasted space in urban spaces not fit for human occupation (basements, attics, crawlspaces, etc) • Exploring the possibilities behind introducing a wider variety of high-nutrient seeds and plants into the urban produce ecosystem • Building a financial case for urban farming At this week's meetup, we're going to host Andrew Carter of Blue Planet Consulting, an agency dedicated to integrating agriculture back into cities. We'll aim the discussion at finding the top-priority projects to pursue immediately, which Andrew can help add insight to, given his depth of involvement in urban farming projects.

As many of you have seen the 2016 NY R Conference is April 8-9 and features Andrew Gelman, Matt Dowle, JJ Allaire, Wes McKinney, Bryan Lewis, Simon Urbanek, Hilary Parker, Max Kuhn and Drew Conway among many other great speakers. Use code nyhackr for a 20% discount. About the talk: I hope to illustrate some of the basics of Bayesian statistics with examples and demonstrations. We will look at the why and wherefore of Bayesian statistical methods and touch on a number of areas where these are applied, such as Bayesian networks and Markov-chain Monte Carlo, paying special attention to dynamic linear models (DLMs) for forecasting. As part of this, we'll survey some of the software commonly used to implement these methods, especially the use of R and J to implement DLMs. About Devon: My undergraduate degree was in philosophy but I've been coding since I was 13. I've worked for many years in analytics, QA, and software support for financial applications for Wall Street firms. I'm a CFA charterholder and have worked with ratings models for mortgage-backed securities, with statistically-based quant models for pairs trading, as well as with Bayesian-based dynamic linear factor models for asset allocation. My personal interests include computer notation as a tool of thought and street photography. Pizza begins at 6:30, the talk shortly after and then we'll head to a local bar.","16 Mar 2016","18:30","625 6th Avenue, Floor 3 New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

To make portfolio metrics more relevant intraday and improve precision of estimates, new data frequency needs to be explored. In this presentation we demonstrate how using high frequency market data for portfolio risk management and optimization could improve the classic variance-bias trade-off and bring new insights to strategy backtesting. We illustrate our examples using PortfolioEffectHFT package for R statistical software. Since high frequency prices require special handling, we discuss key components of a model pipeline for microstruture noise, price jumps, outliers, fat tails and long-memory. We conclude our presentation with an introduction to high frequency portfolio optimization built on top of intraday portfolio metrics. Come and enjoy food and drinks!. Presentation starts at 7:00 pm.

Concept learning provides an illustrative window into the human-machine intelligence gap: People can learn a new concept from just one or a few examples, while the best learning algorithms require many more examples to reach the same level of performance. People also use their concepts in richer ways than conventional machine learning systems -- for imagination, extrapolation, and explanation -- not just for classification. I will discuss my work on program induction as a cognitive model and potential solution for extracting richer concepts from less data, with applications to learning handwritten characters and learning recursive programs from examples.

The goal of our CodeAcross event is to activate the local civic technology network and collaborate with neighbors to develop innovative solutions that help identify and solve real city challenges.  Open to all students and professionals, CodeAcross gives everyone the opportunity to grow and learn – no matter their background or skill. Urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, students, community organizers and civic advocates all participate. CodeAcross isn’t just a chance to build websites, visualizations, and other hacks; it’s also an opportunity to build relationships within the community. Jersey City’s CodeAcross collaborative environment allows teams of all kinds to push the boundaries of innovation and take creative risks for a chance to make a significant impact. Theme: Public Safety (Health &amp; Security) With the support of the relevant departments within the City of Jersey City, we will have access to Open Data for participants to use for their projects and presentations. Representatives from the city will also be present during the day to work with the teams, share insights, and also experience first hand the collaborative power of the community working in their areas of focus. Some of the civic problems we plan to solve are: • What intersections have the highest propensity for traffic accidents, and at what days of the week and times of day? • What impact does weather have on overall police activity? • Where should we stage police resources to create the shortest response times and distances? • Is there a relationship between drug sale/use and/or violent crimes and vacant properties? http://codeforjc.org/CodeAcross2016/ WHEN: March 19, 2016 WHO: Hosted by Code for JC. Attended by anyone with the passion to make Jersey City better. We welcome urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, students, community organizers and civic advocates to all participate. WHERE: Boys &amp; Girls Club of Hudson County. People will connect with other CodeAcross events via #codeacross on Twitter and Tumblr. WHY: Goal is to inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community. Desired Event Outcomes:  • Identify community concerns, examine issues, and prototype solutions that help our communities and make the government more transparent and more safe using public safety and health data  • Continue to power the narrative of Jersey City, the ‘Silicon Backyard’ being the leading modern city in New Jersey.  • Build lasting partnerships between the civic hacker community and the Jersey City Government, City Council Members, Council Staff, Nonprofit, Corporate and Educational Institutions  Agenda:  This hackathon will begin with an overview of the event and event’s theme, followed by inviting the participants to suggest ideas and congregate into teams based on their individual interests and skills. The main work begins and lasts a number of hours. This all culminates with each team demonstrating their project or prototype, as well as presenting on their collaborative process (and usually having to incorporate some fun non-traditional component like summarizing what they did in the form of a haiku). Hackathons are fun, a great way to meet others with similar interests and skills that may not have the opportunity to interact otherwise, and a great way to showcase the amazing technology and civic minded talent that exists right here in our community. 8:00 AM Event organizers arrive to help set up 8:30 AM Food/Coffee/Water arrives 9:00 AM Breakfast  9:30 AM Welcome and Introductions 10:00 AM Open Data Discussion 10:30 AM &amp; 11:00 AM Break out to form teams and hack! 12:00 PM Lunch 4:00 PM Presentations 5:00 PM Judging Please tweet: #CodeAcross #CivicTech #CivicHacking #SiliconBackyard #MakeItYours #JerseyCity","19 Mar 2016","09:00","18 Park Avenue Jersey City",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

Edenworks is a Brooklyn-based urban farming business that's been growing as fast as its plants. The company has a shared vision for a localized agricultural infrastructure in New York City and beyond - which is a vision we definitely share in the Think Tank! Last week, I had the chance to chat with Edenworks' founder, Jason Green. Jason is one of the most committed and visionary people I've met so far in the urban farming environment, and we dove into many of the topics that the Think Tank has addressed in recent weeks.  


Jason and the Edenworks team have a fantastic vision for where the business will go in coming months and years, and he was gracious enough to invite some Think Tankers for a tour of the Edenworks facilities on March 19th. We'll be able to get an up-close and personal look at what the company does, as well as where it's headed, in the same facilities that it grows its plants. There are a max of 10 spots left for the tour, though, and the cutoff date for RSVP's is March 11th, so make sure you snag a spot quickly.","19 Mar 2016","13:30","234 Johnson Ave Brooklyn",2,"open, work, project, will, people, new, code, come, meet, bring"

We have some great speakers lined up from Thomson Reuters, Lightbend, Mezzobit and IBM to share specific use cases and open source technologies such as Apache Spark, Kafka, Akka Streams and others used to solve high performance real-time streaming analytics challenges.

TOPICS AND PRESENTERS Introductions by IBM - The state of Open Source Analytics - market dynamics Host:  Nick Dimtchev -  Open Source Analytics Program Office Worldwide Leader, IBM Analytics  


Talk 1. Metadata: The foundation for big data analytics Presenter: Daniel Meisner, Head of Open Data, Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters will discuss the value of metadata in connecting datasets to each other and real-world objects, empowering big data analytics to drive insights for decisive action. Talk 2. Reactive Streams: The Glue of the Real-time Organization  Presenter: Kevin Webber -  Enterprise Advocate,  Lightbend  ABSTRACT:   The ""real-time organization"" reacts to information now rather than basing critical decisions on stale data. This requires re-imagining how data flows through your organization, moving away from data at rest and moving towards a completely event-based streaming architecture. Events become the lifeblood of the organization, while analytics becomes the brain. Organizations that successfully harness the power of real-time event streaming can transform analytical latencies from hours to seconds. This session will describe a reference architecture using the Lightbend Reactive Platform and other tools that can be used to build out the real-time organization, leveraging real-time data to produce analytics that result in immediate, actionable insights. 


Talk 3.  Using Apache Spark to create the Internet's first audience data firewall: How Mezzobit empowers digital enterprises to regain control of online data and increase customer value Speaker: Joseph Galarneau, CEO and co-founder, Mezzobit, New York ABSTRACT:  Every website exposes visitors to data collection and tracking by scores of third parties, which site owners can’t adequately monitor or control. The resulting data leakage siphons away revenue, slows site performance and increases compliance risk.Taming this problem requires gathering and processing billions of monthly data events per website. Mezzobit's founder talks about their Audience Value Platform and some of the insights it's gathered about the Wild West of online data.

What does that mean? You'll see how to... 1) load the data into a workable state in Python2) plot some distributions of the data3) create a really basic model (logistic regression) using train/test split4) plot the outputs on the test set as a function of whether they were correct/incorrect5) do a simple examination of the misclassifications on the test set This will demonstrate a single “cycle” of the data science approach to tackling a given problem. A data scientist's day-to-day workflow is based on iterations of this cycle.  Come hear from Sergey, see the live demo, and find out more about his upcoming Metis evening course, Intro to Data Science, which starts in New York City on April 19th.

Over the last few weeks, we've explored many facets of the urban agriculture industry, from the challenges it can solve to the technology involved. Last week we honed in on a short list of viable business ideas that would solve this month's challenge of creating a plant-based solution that makes urban farming fun, accessible, and financially feasible for the average NYC resident while supporting the city's impoverished. To finish off the challenge this week, we'll be joined by Teryl Chapel of City Planet Farms, as well as many of our guests from previous weeks. The goal of this meetup is to identify the most actionable business opportunity from our short-list, which everyone will receive during the event.

127866,157189,18212345,"228870888","Please join us for a fun, inclusive one-day event that brings together diverse communities to create and improve Wikipedia articles related to women in the arts. Despite its wide reach, Wikipedia suffers from a severe gender gap: only about 15% of editors are women. In response, diverse women and allies are joining together to celebrate women’s cultural achievements and inspire a new generation of women Wikipedians. OpenPittsburgh is partnering with Art+Feminism (http://artandfeminismpgh.com/) for this event, which coincides with Code for America's Code Across weekend, and International Open Data Day. The event will also serve as a primer on editing Wikipedia, one of the most wide-reaching and often-used institutions of our time. No prior experience necessary. Please register on Eventbrite https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artfeminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-frick-fine-arts-tickets-21135013394?aff=es2 You can also sign your name to our Wikipedia Meetup registration. (Yes, you still have to register on Eventbrite. The Eventbrite will provide us with information to help our planning, and the wikipedia registration will allow us to track how many of the day's edits ""stick"" over time) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Pittsburgh/ArtAndFeminism_2016/University_of_Pittsburgh The Edit-A-Thon still needs a few volunteers, of a variety of technical experience. Volunteers can also participate - shifts are 2-3 hours each, out of a day-long event. Folks interested in volunteering as Greeters, Technical Fascilitators, or Floating Helpers should email alexandra.oliver[at]gmail[dot]com directly. Why so many registration pages?This event has a lot of stakeholders, and registration details are important both for the planning of the event, and for retrospective data about the Edit-A-Thon's impact over time. I’ve never edited Wikipedia before. Is this event really beginner-friendly?Yes! No knowledge of Wikipedia is assumed. I don’t know anything about art or feminism. Can I still participate?Yes! We will have lists of “to do’s” including sourcing, research, editing for spelling/grammar, verifying references, linking and other important general improvements to help make Wikipedia great. We'll also have resources and librarians on hand to help you get started. Are men welcome?Yes. People of all gender expressions and sexual orientations are welcome. We expect that all participants, regardless of their preferred pronoun or identification, will support us in creating a safe, respectful, and woman-positive environment. If you have any questions about this, please ask! Confidentiality respected. What do you mean by “arts” here?“Arts” is conceived broadly to encompass music, design, architecture, visual and performing arts, literature and more. Is childcare available?We are working on securing childcare (off-site, but easily accessible from the venue). Please select a ""child"" ticket for each child for whom you are seeking care, and we will be in touch with more details in advance of the event. Do you have to be a Pitt student or university community member to participate?No. This is not a university event; the university is just our generous host.

Agenda 6:30 PM -- Networking &amp; Food  7:00 PM -- Greetings  7:05 PM -- Apache NiFi - Joe Witt 9:00 PM -- Post event drinks Talks Apache NiFi: Because It Aint Data Science Without the Data Data Science being oriented on the study of the structure and relationships of data is heavily dependent on readily available and quality feeds of data. This is quite obvious but less obvious is just how complex many enterprises are in the ways that they produce, acquire, transmit, transform that data from end-to-end.  The goal of NiFi then is to feed data scientists and their favorite analytic environments with data that is timely, high quality, traceable, and reliable. This talk aims to provide the audience with an understanding of the 'Why' of Apache NiFi, the problem it solves, and how it fits into the big data and data science worlds.  The talk will start with a brief background on where Apache NiFi comes from for those not familiar with its local roots. It will describe the original use cases and those that exist today and how it relates to systems like Kafka, Storm, Spark and the broader Hadoop ecosystem.  The talk will conclude with an explanation of where the NiFi community is heading and will include a live demo of the latest NiFi release in action. Speaker Joe Witt is a member of the Apache Software Foundation, the Apache NiFi PMC, and is the Director of Engineering leading up development of Hortonworks Dataflow powered by Apache NiFi.

130282,162935,19105253,"229422185","Dear Thinkers, In the first meeting we began to understand how the human mind works.  Boutons ideate.  Boutons, pre-synaptic buttons, sense and link ideas into desirable cognitive sets.  That set of linked ideas is your current mindset. In this meet-up we will (1) review and (2) advance this concept and method.  Then we will (3) practically apply that meta-knowledge to an important thinking-problem, selected by the group. The majority of the meetup will focus on Thought Articulation.  This is the practical method for organizing and remembering the ideas needed to be more successful, in any domain of inquiry.   Thought Articulation in sum: draw a border around a subject, say primary education, selling more, and/or getting elected; and then establish the metric.  That defines the before ideological state.  Then identify and organize the ideas that detail exemplary performance.  Write this or remember it; it's a network of ideas.  When you find yourself in that situation Judge then Do (JAD), based on your current intentions. If you know how your mind works, sensing and processing information towards a stated objective, then you can take conscious action to make it work better. Our meet-up is for people whom want to apply these new Cognitive Scientific insights, to get smarter.   Meetup Location: North Shore Community Campus, Lynn Campus.  Meetup is Saturday April 2 at 12 noon to 1:30 PM.  Space for 36 people.   There are no CogSci knowledge prerequisites.  Just bring a thoughtful mindset. This meetup is open to all on a first registration basis. See you then... Gary Deines =============== PS:  As a preview see information at www.UMAKEU.com.  Or, if your first meeting, download the initial presentation slides (click here).  New presentation slides will be sent out a week in advance of this meeting.  Make sure you register at this site to get the slides (just become a group member).

131310,162106,18258270,"229477148","One-Click Healthcare for 1B+ People. ClickMedix took on the challenge of designing for global health to improve the lives of over 1 billion people using mobile phones in 2007.  BostonCHI is hosting Ting Shih, ClickMedix founder and CEO, to talk about ""Designing for Global Health by Personalizing Care Delivery"" at IBM Research in Cambridge. While the idea for ClickMedix started at MIT, the real discovery happened when Ting Shih went to test the idea of using mobile phones to deliver health care in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a lack of doctors, treatments, and over whelming number of patients. To date, ClickMedix has been deployed in 16 countries, in multiple languages and addresses a variety of disease from HIV/AIDS to diabetes. The solution consists of tools for doctors, nurses, health workers, and patients, all “personalized” to the needs of each user. During this session, Ting will share her journey and discovery for designing mobile-phone enabled solutions to deliver personalized care so that each patient can live better, healthier, and happier. About ClickMedix ClickMedix is a global mobile health (mHealth) social enterprise founded by faculty and students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Carnegie Mellon University to increase capacity of physicians and health organizations to serve more patients. By enabling existing medical experts to serve more patients, we can address the following global healthcare challenges: • Lack of access: Patients cannot easily reach doctors. • Lack of funds: Patients cannot afford the high cost of healthcare, and governments/NGOs are unable to subsidize underserved-populations entirely. • Lack of medical resources: Most countries face severe shortages of trained healthcare professionals, especially medical experts. Our Mission is to bring affordable and quality health services to under-served patients, by enabling health organizations to reach more patients through mobile phone/tablet facilitated remote diagnosis, as well as remote training and supervision of their staff assistants, nurses, and health workers. About Ting  “Globally, most people have a mobile phone, some even before they have electricity, so why not use mobile phones to deliver healthcare so that everyone can access healthcare with a Click?” As the founder of ClickMedix, Ting uses her decade of experience in designing and launching technology services, along with associated business strategies for US government, pharmaceutical and global education organizations, to build ClickMedix from an idea in an MIT classroom to a global enterprise. Her areas of expertise include innovation strategy, product development, lean/Six Sigma process improvement, operations management, organization change management, and business development. She spent three years as a founder of Click Diagnostics, a social enterprise born out of the MIT Media Lab, conducting mobile health projects and pilots in over ten countries in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and North America. She was integral to designing mobile health systems that can withstand unreliable or intermittent mobile network, while satisfying the varied needs of healthcare in underserved communities. She founded ClickMedix to build upon the success and learning from the three-year pilot of creating a highly reliable, secure, and user-friendly, HIPAA-compliant telehealth, disease management, and care coordination system that can be deployed quickly to health practitioners and connect patients with medical experts worldwide. Ting leads the design, development, and deployment efforts for ClickMedix’s affordable mobile health and education system. Ting is named Toyota Mothers of Invention in 2015 and Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards Laureate in 2012 for North America.

How does this compare to SQL Server, the venerable boxed product so many DBAs have come to know and love? In this talk from long-time Azure MVP Bill Wilder, we will look at similarities and differences. We will also briefly talk about complementary data storage sources that may also interest DBAs. At the end of the talk, you will understand the big picture of database options in the cloud, how Azure SQL Database is positioned and stacks up relative to SQL, and leave with an appreciation of key scenarios where it might make sense to use one over the other.  Bill Wilder is a cloud computing veteran, with deep expertise in the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

The envisioned format will be: 6:00 - 6:30 - Networking, food &amp; beverage 6:30 - 6:40 - Message from our sponsors 6:40 - 8:15 - Two talks of 45 minutes long including Q&amp;A 8:15 - 8:30 - Wrap-up Presentation #1: Title: Clustering Big Data. Description: Approximate Nearest Neighbor methods for clustering and indexing have been actively researched ever since the K-Means algorithm was published in 1975 (and coded in FORTRAN). A recent book (https://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466558212) lists about 300 variants and related topics.  The talk will feature OpenLSH, a python-based open source implementation of LSH we have been working on. We'll demo the algorithm by analyzing tweets in near-real-time, hopefully we'll find some similar or identical pairs. We're looking for other large data sets to work with and if you know a juicy one, we'd love to hear about it. Speaker Bios: Dr. J Singh is a Principal at DataThinks.org, a Cloud and Big Data consulting company. He is a frequent speaker on NoSQL, Hadoop--Map/Reduce and analytics of social media. Dr. Singh is an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at WPI where he covers Database Technology, Big Data and Data Mining.

She lives with her cat Molly and dog Rondo. 


Presentation #2: Title: Anomaly Detection in Spark Description: Detection of outliers and anomalies has numerous applications in network security, predictive maintenance, fraud, etc.  Unlike many analytics applications, anomaly detection typically requires utilization of all data without sampling, making it an ideal match for big data tools like Spark.  The most commonly cited approach on big data is the use of clustering; however, clustering and other unsupervised approaches have significant drawbacks. In this interactive session, we'll discuss the tradeoff between supervised and unsupervised approaches, then show an approach for using supervised models in situations where labeled data does not exist.  Throughout, we'll demonstrate insights over Spark using iPython and an example dataset.

While recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering make this work technically feasible, commercial success is hindered by the cost to develop the microbes. Development has been costly because the complexity and diversity of biology favored a labor-intensive, small-batch approach to engineering. Ginkgo has built a foundry that allows many microbial engineering projects to use shared processes in a high-throughput, largely-automated fashion, that unlocks substantial economies of scale. In this talk, I will outline the approach, custom software, and hardware that we use to allow flexibility and scale to co-exist where previously one came at the expense of the other. I will illustrate this with examples from each stage of the engineering process across representative projects.  


Barry Canton co-founded synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks in 2008 and has helped build the company to 55 people and raised more than $50M in investment over the last year. At Ginkgo, Barry is responsible for the development of the foundry, a centralized facility for organism engineering. In this role he oversees the development of hardware, software, and wetware technologies. Earlier, he led the development of new methods for assembling DNA from standard parts. He holds a PhD in Biological Engineering from MIT, where his thesis focused on refinement of standard biological parts and the interactions between a host cell and an engineered genetic circuit. At MIT, he was involved with the Synthetic Biology Working Group that was instrumental in catalyzing the new field. He also holds an MEngSc in Mechanical Engineering from University College Dublin.

Featured Talk: Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) is a fully managed, cost effective real-time event processing engine that helps to unlock deep insights from data. Stream Analytics makes it easy to set up real-time analytic computations on data streaming from devices, sensors, web sites, social media, applications, infrastructure systems, and more. In this introductory session to ASA, you will learn how to create stream processing logic to gather data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We will use a real-world, Internet of Things (IoT) use-case to demonstrate how to build your solution quickly and economically. We are going to learn how to: • Setup and Configure ASA in Azure Portal. • Create Azure Event Hub to stream the data. • Create ASA Jobs to process IoT steaming data. • Use the Stream Analytics query language. • Consume and save processed data.

More people want to live in cities and live, work, play within a reasonable distance. The younger generation is also more aware of the impacts of their activities on human health and the environment. Modern urban development has focused on creating mixed-use neighborhoods and transit-oriented development, as well as using more sustainable materials. At the building level, this means creating a healthy and efficient space for occupants that has a positive impact on the environment. Residential and commercial buildings represent 41% of total energy consumption in the U.S. With growing commitments at the Federal, Regional and City level, there is still a huge opportunity for cleantech startups to develop solutions that will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and create more sustainable livelihoods. During this Open Innovation Club Techmeeting, startups and large corporations will get together to discover the latest innovations and develop business relationships around: ·  Sustainable building solutions for resilience, health and safety ·  Smart and connected building technology for energy efficiency

Abstract: From ordinary least squares (OLS) to lasso and elastic-net regularized models, fitting data using linear regression is one of the most powerful and common approaches to understanding the structure of data. However, while there are many resources for understanding their statistical properties and their optimality characteristics only a few describe how to implement these models. In this talk I'll show how OLS, GLM, Ridge, and ElasticNet models fit into a single computational framework that can be implemented in short, understandable snippets of R code. I'll also show how this framework is used in the ioregression package, which fits linear models out-of-core.","20 Apr 2016","18:00"," ",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

132830,161381,9505222,"230115179","Data and analytics are changing the way businesses compete and operate by driving new types of insights that empower individuals and organizations to achieve far more than ever before. A key to driving value from big data is getting analytics out of IT and spread throughout the organization. This shift to the spread of analytics throughout the organization and accompanying empowerment of individual users has led to the substantial increase in popularity in recent years of the R programming language. R is now the predominant tool used for computational statistics, data science and visualization. R is used extensively by the largest analytics driven companies in the world such as Google LinkedIn and Facebook. In this session we will addresses the challenges of scaling R analytics at an enterprise level for big data and making scalable R analytics readily accessible to end users. We will explore the use of scalable, high performance platforms such as Spark; in-memory, columnar, massively parallel databases; and Hadoop to enable scalable R analytics. We will also explore cloud deployment patterns for enhanced agility and accessibility. In the session we will walk through examples and demos of R programs running on these scalable platforms.","26 Apr 2016","18:00","1 Rogers Street Cambridge",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Come be part of this fun, hands-on and thought-provoking conference - you’ll leave with the knowledge to facilitate a variety of games and activities and gain practical ideas that you can start to apply in your team, workgroup or organization right away!  This event is not filled to capacity.  We are doing registration and payment on a link outside of Meetup, so please do not try to RSVP here.  For detailed information or to register, please go the Agile Games 2016 website: agilegamesnewengland.com   Agile Games 2016 is an event of Agile New England, a chapter of the ACM.","28 Apr 2016","08:00","One Memorial Drive Cambridge",6,"will, event, well, new, network, get, come, nyc, workshop, drink"

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/nosql-data In today's data centers, the network has become the bottleneck. A key challenge for storage systems, including both databases and NoSQL stores, is how to minimize network traffic when accessing and updating stored data. Standard data access APIs place the burden of implementing data structures on the client and thereby exacerbate data motion between clients and servers. In contrast, implementing data structures within a storage system can dramatically streamline communication since only incremental changes to stored data need to be transferred. However, building server-based data structures creates several challenges, including how to make this mechanism easy to use, secure, and extensible. In-memory data grids (IMDGs) have been widely used as distributed, key-value stores for serialized objects, providing blazingly fast data access, location transparency, scalability, and integrated high availability. Redis has pioneered the use of memory-based, data-structure stores with its support for built-in data structures, such as hashed sets and lists, to provide functionality similar to stored procedures in databases. This talk describes exciting new techniques which use the power of IMDGs to generalize this concept and enable the straightforward creation of extensible, user-defined data structures held within an IMDG. This session will explore how IMDGs can implement user-defined data structures by leveraging their NoSQL, object-oriented, data-parallel data model. We will also discuss techniques that lets applications define object-oriented methods which execute within the IMDG to implement a user-defined data structure. Other techniques extends this approach for scalability by distributing stored data across the IMDG's cluster of servers and performing data-parallel operations across the distributed data structure. Several examples will be described that demonstrate both the power of this approach and its ability to reduce network congestion. Dr. William L.

If you can't make it to the main event please join us at Live Bait around 9:15PM for a social hour.As the block size debate rages on, a common question that arises is: what function does decentralization serve in Bitcoin's security model? Said differently: how much decentralization does Bitcoin need to be secure? To answer this question we must first explore the metrics which define decentralization. Once a general framework for decentralization has been outlined/agreed upon, we can explore varying opinions on threat models for the Bitcoin network. For example: some believe that if Bitcoin nodes were exclusively run in data centers that would provide sufficient security/privacy/autonomy for network participants, while others believe that resource requirements for running a full node should be kept accessible so network participants can run their own nodes and validate incoming block and transaction data without having to trust a third party. Related questions we will discuss: • Is node count a good metric of decentralization? • How accessible should running a node be? • Why is running a node important (or not)? • Do you think block size should be purely a denial-of-service prevention measure? (link) • Do you think they serve an economic purpose (e.g. to ""create a transaction fee market"")? • What is the state of the mining network in the context of decentralization?  Please read the following articles to prepare yourself for discussion (and feel free to submit other articles and questions you feel are relevant to bitdevsnyc (at) gmail (dot) com): • http://truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization • http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/01/14/decentralization/ • http://wallstreettechnologist.com/2016/02/05/the-decentralization-myth/ • http://organofcorti.blogspot.de/2014/12/measures-of-network-hashrate.html • http://www.initc3.org/scalingblockchain/full.pdf  Message from our sponsors: Rise New York is part of a global community of the world’s brightest thinkers and doers creating the future of financial technology.

Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity). These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business. This type of hybrid cloud, near real time analytic application requires streaming analytics capabilities, messaging systems and secure gateways to integrate cloud and on-premise systems.  In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop.

Rethinking REST in a Microservices World with Lagom by Henrik Engstrom (Lightbend AKA Typesafe) Don’t block on it! Migrate your codebase before its too late! by Sujan Kapadia (Chariot Solutions)  --------------------------------- Don’t block on it! Migrate your codebase before its too late!   Let’s face it - many of us regularly encounter (or may still be producing) code that performs blocking operations and doesn’t play nicely with new “reactive” libraries or fit well in the world of micro services. Most shops are either starting with existing code, integrating with legacy components, or even migrating Java code to Scala for example. In this talk, we’ll go over various “mundane” techniques to introduce incremental changes that can make your software “non-blocking” and “event driven”. While Scala Futures and Akka actors will take center stage, we’ll also cover topics such as functional error handling, monad transformers, thread pools, the circuit breaker pattern, non-blocking HTTP request handling, and briefly touch upon Akka Streams. These building blocks eventually lead to more advanced topics such as location transparency, micro services, and fully reactive APIs, but in my experience its necessary for teams to master the basics first. About Sujan Sujan Kapadia's 6th grade social studies teacher got him interested in programming and he’s never looked back. He’s spent the majority of his career developing enterprise and distributed software in Java for various industries. Sujan currently works for Chariot Solutions, where he’s part of a team of Jedi knights that get to wield light sabers and travel the universe. Two years ago he decided to power up and add Scala to his arsenal. Scala is spreading fast, and he’s used it for clients in telecom, e-commerce, and pharma. His current interests include machine learning, productivity hacks, and spending as much time as possible with his soon to be 4 year old daughter. ----------------- Rethinking REST in a Microservices World with Lagom   Many of us are doing microservices wrong. We’re splitting our systems up into smaller and smaller services, paying all the costs that that entails, but only getting a taste of the benefits, and the problem is REST. Microservices are supposed to promise isolation, isolation from faults, isolation from load failures, but synchronous communication means failure and unresponsiveness bubbles back up through our services along our communication pathways, undermining the promises that microservices offer. To realize the full potential of microservices, we need to stop using REST as our go to, and start rethinking our architectures to use asynchronous communication. This presentation looks at how this can be achieved in a practical manner by using Lagom; a microservices framework from Lightbend.  About Henrik After graduating with a M.Sc degree in Computer Science in 1998 at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm/Sweden, Henrik has been working as a consultant up until his Lightbend (Typesafe) employment in 2011. Henrik has not only vast experience from various types of programming but also great domain knowledge within the finance, retail and e-gaming industries. Apart from his major interest, programming languages, he is also an avid Arsenal supporter, martial artist and a hobby wine connoisseur.","27 Apr 2016","18:45","2 Park Ave New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service has operated in El Barrio / East Harlem since 1958. But their roots go back to 1891, when the first Little Sisters of the Assumption (LSA) arrived here from Paris to nurse the “sick poor” in their own homes with respect and dignity. Those first LSA visiting nurses saw themselves as catalysts for change in the lives of vulnerable families. They believed in what we now call social justice and empowerment, with health and well being forming a cornerstone of strength, just as they still believe today.  Today, as a secular nonprofit agency, they proudly honor their mission, roots and their founders’ choice to value and respect diversity and the differences between us. LSA Family Health Service provides advocacy, food pantry, early childhood intervention, youth, parenting, environmental health and education services. On April 29th and 30th latinoTech joins the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers to present a new hackathon, centered on identifying operational and service solutions to advance the mission of the LSA Family Health Service.

Advanced AI would be able to reprogram and improve itself – a feature called ""recursive self-improvement"". It would then be even better at improving itself, and could continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to a super-intelligence. This scenario is known as an intelligence explosion. Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and may be able to invent or discover almost anything. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? A human-like reasoner that could think millions of times faster than current humans would have a dominant advantage in most reasoning tasks, particularly ones that require haste or long strings of actions. However, it's definitely not clear if super-intelligence will come with super-consciousness, because at some point they might split and develop itself in their own way?

This is the last meetup before the 2016 NY R Conference, April 8-9, featuring Andrew Gelman, Matt Dowle, JJ Allaire, Wes McKinney, Bryan Lewis, Simon Urbanek, Hilary Parker, Max Kuhn and Drew Conway among many other great speakers. It is almost sold out but you can use code nyhackr for a 20% discount off remaining tickets. About the talk: Although it is relatively straightforward to represent static network graphs and to emphasize various network properties or node attributes in R, providing interactivity for the viewer can dramatically improve visual appeal as well as comprehension. Further, effectively visualizing how social networks emerge or change over time is still a great challenge. In this talk I will briefly recap standard methods for visualizing social networks in R using packages such as igraph as well as transferring R data to other visualization tools such as Gephi or d3.js. I will also give examples of some recently developed R packages and htmlwidgets such as networkD3, visNetwork and threejs that provide user interactivity. Finally, I shall describe some ways in which the temporal dynamics of social networks can be captured. About James: Professor James Curley is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Columbia University and executive member of the Columbia Center for Integrative Animal Behavior. His lab researches the temporal dynamics of social behavior particularly within social hierarchies as well as the neurobiological, genetic and hormonal bases of social relationships in social networks. Prior to establishing his lab, James was a Research Scientist at Columbia University, the Charles &amp; Katharine Darwin Research Fellow at Darwin College, University of Cambridge and a Leverhulme Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge. James received his PhD in 2003 from the University of Cambridge. James teaches introductory and intermediate R programming at Columbia University to undergraduate students as well as mentoring and teaching graduate students from the Psychology, Statistics, Data Science, Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences, Evolutionary Biology and Sports Management programs. James also taught Data Visualization in the Columbia University edX MOOC “Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics.” Pizza begins at 6:30, the talk shortly after and then we'll head to a local bar. ","06 Apr 2016","18:30","625 6th Avenue, Floor 3 New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Abstract: Machine learning is changing the way we analyze data. We want to study large datasets to shed light on complicated processes. (How do proteins function? How do people navigate a city?) To this end, we need tools to rapidly and iteratively explore hidden patterns in data. However, using machine learning to discover such patterns requires enormous effort and cross-disciplinary expertise. In this talk, Alp will present strategies to automate tedious machine learning computations. He will show how we can design one algorithm to work for many problems and gain new insights from large datasets.

However, many collections contain an additional type of data: how people use the documents. For example, readers click on articles in a newspaper website, scientists place articles in their personal libraries, and lawmakers vote on a collection of bills. Behavior data is essential both for making predictions about users (such as for a recommendation system) and for understanding how a collection and its users are organized. I will review the basics of topic modeling and describe our recent research on collaborative topic models, models that simultaneously analyze a collection of texts and its corresponding user behavior. We studied collaborative topic models on 80,000 scientists' libraries from Mendeley and 100,000 users' click data from the arXiv. Collaborative topic models enable interpretable recommendation systems, capturing scientists' preferences and pointing them to articles of interest. Further, these models can organize the articles according to the discovered patterns of readership. For example, we can identify articles that are important within a field and articles that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Bio:  David Blei is a Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at Columbia University, and a member of the Columbia Data Science Institute. His research is in statistical machine learning, involving probabilistic topic models, Bayesian nonparametric methods, and approximate posterior inference algorithms for massive data. He works on a variety of applications, including text, images, music, social networks, user behavior, and scientific data. David has received several awards for his research, including a Sloan Fellowship (2010), Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award (2011), Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2011), Blavatnik Faculty Award (2013), and ACM-Infosys Foundation Award (2013).

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/nosql-newsql In this talk, we will discuss the essential features, similarities and differences between the perspectives of what will be 'the database of the future' and also discuss the impact of modern hardware on database architecture and data languages. We are currently in a time that is considered the revolution of new databases. Cutting-edge data technologies span the gamut of NoSQL, key-value stores, map reduce, graph databases, NewSQL, streaming, in-memory, distributed, replicated, etc. Massive amounts of data exists in structured form, unstructured and schema-less. Programming models increasingly use functional programming idioms and languages such as Clojure, Scala and F# inspired by Scheme, Haskell and O'Caml. Data architectures are also a hot topic of discussion such as ACID vs BASE, immutable database, micro-services database per service, OLTP vs the Twitter Storm Lambda Architecture, Gartner HTAP or Forrester Translytical Database. In the last decade years there have been significant improvements in processor cost, solid state storage, high performance clusters and cloud computing. The number of cores has increased significantly, but unfortunately without tools beyond map-reduce to really make them easily accessible. As of yet, specialized hardware such as FPGAs and GPUS have just been used for niche applications, and also have challenging programming models. More recently, CPUs have added vector instructions, however tools and programming languages have been slow to exploit them. Small-memory gigabyte machines have rapidly expanded into terabyte machines. Most recently, with 3D NVM memory we are promised massive increases in persistent memory and reduced latency.

138137,166149,18706743,"229694046"," Large-scale, non-linear learning on a single CPU - Andreas Mueller In the days of the ""big data"" buzz, many people build data driven applications on clusters from the start. However, working with distributed computing is not only pricey, but also requires a large engineering effort and removes interactivity from the data exploration process. In this talk I will demonstrate how to learn powerful nonlinear models on a single machine, even with large data sets. This can be achieved using the partial_fit interface provided by scikit-learn, that implements stochastic updates. Together with stateless transformation of the data, such as hashing, kernel approximation and random projections, these allow incrementally building a model without the need to store all the data in memory, or even on disk. Andreas Mueller is an Research Engineer at the NYU Center for Data Science,building open source software for data science. Previously he worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon, developing solutions for computer vision and forecasting problems. He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine learning library, and has co-maintained it for several years. His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access to high-quality machine learning algorithms. 


Compiled, Auto-Parallel Python with Pyfora (Tom Peters) Writing performant Python code is hard. Pyfora makes it easier with a JIT compiler and adaptive parallelism. We'll give an introduction to the Pyfora open source project, and some of its applications in data science.

Or are interested in making the process easier and more transparent? Please join one of BetaNYC’s members and Knight Prototype Fund Winners, Max Galka, as he demos his FOIA Mapper.  For this BetaTalk, Max will talk about the importance of the freedom of information law, the law’s digital connectivity, and introduce us to FOIA Mapper. A majority of the event will focus on feedback and your reactions to guide the next stage of the development.   What is FOIA Mapper?  Government agencies store an enormous amount of data in offline databases, far more than what is available online as open data. And in theory, anyone has the right to access it through a Freedom of Information request. However, the catch is that most government databases are not documented anywhere online, so there is no practical way of knowing what to ask for. The goal of FOIA Mapper is to collect information about these opaque offline databases and organize it into a searchable catalog - basically a search engine for offline government data. &lt; https://foiamapper.com &gt; Where are we meeting?  Tuesday, 12 April 2016Noon to 2pmCivic Hall’s CafeLunch will be provided, $5.00 suggested donation. What should you bring? A computing device. Ideally a laptop or large tablet. What is a BetaTalk? A BetaTalk is a salon series that works to demystify technology, data, design, and give you access to the civic leaders behind it all.

Please Use Lafayette Street Entrance. ** Please RSVP with your first and last name.** You are invited to join us for a data science study session. On Wednesday, April 13th, Erin LeDell from H2O will present and lead a machine learning workshop on H2O R and Python packages. Schedule 6:30 PM - 6:45 PM Food, Drinks, Settling Down 6:45 PM - 7:00 PM Short Introductions 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM Erin's Keynote Presentation &amp; Workshop 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM Networking Food and drinks will be provided, courtesy of H2O. Summary The focus of this workshop is machine learning using the H2O R and Python packages. H2O is an open source distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java; however, fully featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of generalized linear models, gradient boosting machines, random forest, deep neural nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), and anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or ""super learners,"" from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble R package. R and Python Jupyter notebooks with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and made available on GitHub for attendees to follow along on their laptops. For those interested in running the code on a multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster, an H2O AMI is also available. Biography Erin LeDell is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O. She is the author of a handful of machine learning related software packages, including the h2oEnsemble R package for ensemble learning with H2O. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.","13 Apr 2016","18:30"," ",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Before joining Bloomberg, Haoyun received her Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Notre Dame and a M.S. in Machine Learning from Columbia University. ""Practical Considerations for ML Evaluation at Scale"" Machine Learning is a popular technique for solving problems like automated document classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis and many other predictive tasks. Evaluating different approaches on different data sets, however is key to getting the optimal benefits from this technology. As ML has evolved, so have the ways that we look at performance and convey performance metrics to stakeholders. This talk will cover some of the most useful evaluation metrics for doing evaluation at scale, in a dynamic enterprise environment, where crucial product decisions must be made on the basis of this data.  Leslie Barrett is a member of the Bloomberg Verticals Machine Learning Team specializing in Information Retrieval, Information Extraction and Classification Evaluation.

Commodity Machine Learning - (Andreas Mueller) Recent years have seen a widespread adoption of machine learning in industry and academia, impacting diverse areas from advertisement to personal medicine.  As more and more areas adopt machine learning and data science techniques, the question arises on how much expertise is needed to successfully apply machine learning, data science and statistics.  Not every company can afford a data science team, and getting your PhD in biology, no-one can expect you to have PhD-level expertise in computer science and statistics. This talk will summarize recent progress in automating machine learning and give an overview of the tools currently available.  It will also point out areas where the ecosystem needs to improve in order to allow a wider access to inference using data science techniques.  Finally we will point out some open problems regarding assumptions, and limitations of what can be automated. Andreas is an Research Engineer at the NYU Center for Data Science, building open source software for data science.  Previously, he worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon, developing solutions for computer vision and forecasting problems.  He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine learning library, and has co-maintained it for several years. His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access to high-quality machine learning algorithms.

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/gpu-analytics Apache Spark and GPUs are two of the biggest stories in Data Science and Analytics in the past year. Apache Spark makes it easy to build analytics over large scale data sets. NVIDIA GPUs provide the computational power for machine and deep learning challenges. However, It is non-trivial to exploit the power of GPUs and scale applications onto multi-core, parallel architectures. GPU algorithms not only require significant expertise to develop, but also intimate knowledge of the CPU and GPU memory systems, and detailed knowledge of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), Writing fast, efficient data analytics for graph and machine learning on GPUs can be hard due to the complexities of CUDA and achieving effective parallelism. DASL and SPARQL are high-level languages for graph and machine learning algorithms (DASL) and graph pattern matching (SPARQL) that provide speedups of up to 1,000x over Spark native and up to 300x over leading graph databases when executed on the BlazeGraph platform. We will present Blazegraph GPU benchmarking results against our SPARQL-enabled, non-GPU Blazegraph platform over the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) and Berlin Sparql Benchmark (BSBM) demonstrating[masked]X speed-up. Users of the RDF/SPARQL API are able to achieve this acceleration simply by changing to the GPU-enabled platform without underlying code or application changes. We will present Blazegraph DASL (pronounced 'dazzle') for graph and predictive analytics that combines the ease of Spark with the speed of GPUs. It has shown 1000X acceleration for large graphs when compared to in-memory processing with GraphX. DASL is a Scala-based language provides graphs and machine learning algorithms over linear algebra primitives. DASL programs are translated into task graphs that expose the available parallelism. The underlying Blazegraph DASL runtime integrates closely with Apache Spark. It provides the ability to write and execute DASL programs in Apache Spark and delivers a distributed, scalable architecture for machine learning and graph algorithms on GPUs and GPU clusters within the Spark environment. Brad Bebee, Chief Executive Officer, Blazegraph Brad is the CEO of Blazegraph leading efforts to deliver graphs at scale with Blazegraph products. An expert in graphs and large-scale analytics, he has a diverse background in software developments, telecommunications, and information retrieval.

NYU's Associate Professor Julian Togelius works at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and games—a largely unexplored juncture that he has shown can be the site of visionary and mind-expanding research. Could games provide a better AI test bed than robots, which—despite the way they excite public imagination—can be slow, unwieldy and expensive? According to him, the answer is resoundingly yes.  Could an artificially intelligent operating system exhibit more originality than a human game designer? Togelius thinks so. ""I'm teaching computers to be more creative than humans,"" he says.

Complementing the tree planting will be the JC Tree Lovers Crew, a brigade of volunteers trained to help monitor and maintain public trees.    Jersey City OpenTreeMap: OpenTreeMap is a tool we are using to provide a practical means of inventory through citizen lead data-collection. A component of City of Trees’ mission is to create a progressive maintenance program alongside our municipal partners.  OTM allows the public to be part of this process. As the community gets involved, their awareness and interest become more of an integral part of their lives, and a sense of interconnectivity grows. In turn, our credibility as an organization becomes more valuable to the public by providing them with an outlet to be heard. Getting involved is easy to do and the data collection is very accurate. Users simply register their info, and begin mapping the trees around them.  At the basic level, they take a photo, measure the circumference (or diameter), and enter the tree species. OTM uses the USDA’s i-tree software to automatically generate various eco-benefits, which we then present as cost-befits to funders and city agencies. After the primary information is entered, users have the option to enter alerts such as: “needs water” “tree has been topped” “dead tree” etc. They can also add information about the planting sides: “empty tree pit” “needs concrete removal” “remove trash”.  After stewardship tasks have been completed, anyone can click back on that pin and record the actions taken. In the end, this process embodies the idea that the most effective way to bring about change is not by empty complaints or government handouts, but a combination of top-down support and bottom-up expertise.

140749,176433,18508242,"230487368"," Dr. Jennifer Chayes Distinguished Scientist and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England Once Upon a Graph: How to Get from Now to Then in Massive Networks Abstract: Networks are increasingly important in many aspects of our world: physical networks like transportation networks, utility networks and the Internet, online information networks like the WWW, online social networks like Facebook and Twitter, epidemiological networks for global disease transmission, genomic and protein networks in computational biology, and many more. How do we model and learn these networks? In contrast to conventional learning problems, where we have many independent samples, it is often the case for these networks that we can get only one independent sample. How do we use a single snapshot today to learn a model for the network, and therefore be able to predict a similar, but larger network in the future? In the case of relatively small or moderately sized networks, it's appropriate to model the network parametrically, and attempt to learn these parameters. For massive networks, a non-parametric representation is more appropriate. Here I show how to use the theory of graph limits, developed over the last decade, to give consistent estimators for machine learning of massive sparse networks, and moreover how to do this in a way that protects the privacy of individuals on the network. Biography: Jennifer Tour Chayes is Distinguished Scientist and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she co-founded in 2008, and Microsoft Research New York City, which she co-founded in 2012. Chayes was Research Area Manager for Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Cryptography at Microsoft Research Redmond until 2008. Chayes joined Microsoft Research in 1997, when she co-founded the Theory Group. Her research areas include phase transitions in discrete mathematics and computer science, structural and dynamical properties of self-engineered networks, and algorithmic game theory. She is the co-author of about 125 scientific papers and the co-inventor of about 30 patents. Chayes has many ties to the academic community. She was for many years Professor of Mathematics at UCLA. She serves on numerous institute boards, advisory committees and editorial boards, including the Turing Award Selection Committee of the Association for Computing Machinery, the Board of Trustees of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, the Advisory Boards of the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farm Research Campus, and Women Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology. Chayes is a past Chair of the Mathematics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a past Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society. Chayes received her B.A. in biology and physics at Wesleyan University, where she graduated first in her class, and her Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Princeton. She did her postdoctoral work in the mathematics and physics departments at Harvard and Cornell. She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Sloan Fellowship, and the UCLA Distinguished Teaching Award. Chayes has recently been the recipient of many leadership awards including the Leadership Award of Women Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology, the Leading Women Award of the Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts, the Women to Watch Award of the Boston Business Journal, and the Women of Leadership Vision Award of the Anita Borg Institute. She has twice been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Chayes is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Fields Institute, the Association for Computing Machinery, the American Mathematical Society, a National Associate of the National Academies, and an Elected Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Chayes is well known for her work on phase transitions, in particular for laying the foundation for the study of phase transitions in problems in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science; this study is now giving rise to some of the fastest known algorithms for fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization. She is also one of the world's experts in the modeling and analysis of random, dynamically growing graphs, which are used to model the Internet, the World Wide Web and a host of other technological and social networks. Among Chayes' contributions to Microsoft technologies are the development of methods to analyze the structure and behavior of various networks, the design of auction algorithms, and the design and analysis of various business models for the online world.","20 Apr 2016","17:00"," ",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

But the truth is that Spark Streaming lacks the robust data management capabilities that even moderately sophisticated applications require. But with SnappyData as part of your solution, now you get the benefit of powerful data management capabilities such as data consistency and transactions, complex querying, and high availability - all at in-memory processing speed. SnappyData is a new open source project that deeply integrates the Apache Geode in-memory data grid, an in-memory scale out SQL store, and Spark into a single unified cluster. This provides (i) low latency transactions, (ii) a new cluster manager capable of avoiding queuing and scheduling for low latency operations, (iii) and HA for all the components. This novel architecture transforms a spark cluster into a hybrid database with OLAP (compressed columnar tables) and OLTP tables with full HA and recovery.  In this Meetup we'll discuss response time challenges with analytic queries on streams. We'll outline ""Synopsis"" synopses data structures available in SnappyData, such as stratified sampling, that reside along side ""exact"" data for fastest processing.  We'll also present our design pattern for an Analytics SQL cache that combines Apache Spark and the Greenplum DB as the backend to speed up interactive query processing while accommodating continuous streaming writes.   We will demo Snappy working with Spark and Spark streaming, how to use them with the Spark programming model, and SQL/Spark Dataframe extensions for supporting approximate query processing.  We'll show how we achieve 10X performance gains of using SnappyData with Spark streaming compared to Cassandra and showcase similar gains when running OLAP queries on the ingested data compared to Spark SQL (using Stratified samples).  ABOUT THE SPEAKER: Jags is a founder and the CTO of SnappyData. Previously, Jags was the Chief Architect for “fast data” products at Pivotal and served in the extended leadership team of the company. At Pivotal and previously at VMWare, he led the technology direction for GemFire and other distributed in-memory products.","20 Apr 2016","18:30","625 Avenue of Americas, 2nd Floor New York",5,"data, will, apache, use, applicable, big, present, talk, platform, analytic"

No Schema, No Problem! – Introduction to Azure DocumentDB Abstract This session presents an overview of Azure DocumentDB, a new massively-scalable, fully managed NoSQL database platform designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports a schema-free data model and scales easily. But it also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios. We begin by explaining NoSQL and document databases, and how they compare with traditional relational database platforms. Then we tour the many features of DocumentDB, including rich querying with SQL (that’s right, you query this NoSQL database using SQL!), and client development using the REST API and the DocumentDB SDKs. Next, learn about the server-side programming model and write fully transactional stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. Also explore tunable consistency, scale-out partitioning, custom indexing, attachments, and more. Attend this session, and get up to speed on DocumentDB today! Goals Get introduced to NoSQL, document databases, and Microsoft Azure DocumentDB. Understand the differences between NoSQL and relational database platforms, and when to choose one or the other for your next application. Learn about the unique NoSQL features of DocumentDB, including rich query over schema-free data, client development, server-side programming, tunable consistency, indexing, partitioning, and attachments.

With the increased adoption ofelectronic health records and a surge in funding for health ITstartups, health care is undergoing a similar transformation. I willtalk about how machine learning has the potential to change healthcareacross the spectrum, from enabling the next-generation electronichealth record to population-level risk stratification from healthinsurance claims (examples will come from my group's work). Theseinnovations will lead to increased quality of care and decreased cost. Speaker Bio:

Panelist: John Bandler, Esq. | Bandler Group  Discussion topic: Cybercrime and data privacy are serious issues that we face today, and those creating new technologies, products, and applications should think about privacy and security by design, rather than something to be added on as the product nears completion.  Cybercriminals are constantly looking at ways to break into systems and applications to steal the data.  And technologies are collecting more and more data about people which needs to be safeguarded and treated according to various laws and regulations. John Bandler founded a legal and consulting practice to bring his experience to the private sector to help corporations and individuals with cybersecurity, data privacy, investigations, and anti-money laundering.  John has 20 years of government experience, including thirteen as a prosecutor at the New York County District Attorney's Office, where he was hired by the legendary Robert M. Morgenthau. He gained unique insights into cybercrime, cybercrime intelligence, digital currency money laundering, and identity theft, and also prosecuted a wide variety of cases from inception through resolution, ranging from global cybercrime data trafficking and money laundering to violent street crime. Prior to his time as a prosecutor, John served as a State Trooper in the New York State Police for eight years, serving in one of the busiest stations in the state.  He was also a commissioned U.S. Army officer, serving in infantry and military intelligence reserve units. He is licensed to practice law in NY, CT, and DC, and holds various professional certifications in fraud investigation, information security, privacy, anti-money laundering, and information technology, including CISSP, GCIH, GCCC, CIPP/US, CFE, CAMS, Cloud +, Network +, and A +.

Panelist: John Bandler, Esq. | Bandler Group  Cybercrime and data privacy are serious issues that we face today, and those creating new technologies, products, and applications should think about privacy and security by design, rather than something to be added on as the product nears completion.  Cybercriminals are constantly looking at ways to break into systems and applications to steal the data.  And technologies are collecting more and more data about people which needs to be safeguarded and treated according to various laws and regulations. John Bandler founded a legal and consulting practice to bring his experience to the private sector to help corporations and individuals with cybersecurity, data privacy, investigations, and anti-money laundering.  John has 20 years of government experience, including thirteen as a prosecutor at the New York County District Attorney's Office, where he was hired by the legendary Robert M. Morgenthau. He gained unique insights into cybercrime, cybercrime intelligence, digital currency money laundering, and identity theft, and also prosecuted a wide variety of cases from inception through resolution, ranging from global cybercrime data trafficking and money laundering to violent street crime. Prior to his time as a prosecutor, John served as a State Trooper in the New York State Police for eight years, serving in one of the busiest stations in the state.  He was also a commissioned U.S. Army officer, serving in infantry and military intelligence reserve units. He is licensed to practice law in NY, CT, and DC, and holds various professional certifications in fraud investigation, information security, privacy, anti-money laundering, and information technology, including CISSP, GCIH, GCCC, CIPP/US, CFE, CAMS, Cloud +, Network +, and A +.

142517,176433,18508242,"230631173"," Prasad Chalasani | MediaMath I3 Institute-Industry-Innovation Seminar Series Prasad Chalasani | Senior Vice President of Data Science Title: Estimating Causal Effect of Ads in Real-Time Bidding Platform Abstract:  A real-time bidding platform responds to incoming ad-opportunities (“bid requests”) by deciding whether or not to submit a bid and how much to bid. If the submitted bid wins, the user is shown an ad. Advertisers hope that ad-exposure leads to an increased likelihood of a desired action, such as a click or conversion (purchase, etc). So an important quantity that advertisers want to measure is the causal effect of advertising, namely, what is the response probability of an exposed user, compared with the counterfactual (un-observable) response-rate of the user if they were not exposed to the ad.  In an ideal randomized test, the user is randomly assigned to test or control AFTER the submitted bid is won, and test users are served the ad in the normal way, while control users are not. While this is ideal from a statistical perspective, in practice this approach has the drawback that money spent by advertisers is wasted when a user is assigned to control.  At MediaMath we have developed a methodology for causal effect measurement where users are assigned to test or control BEFORE bid submission. One challenge here is that not all test-group users are exposed to an ad; only a winning bid results in ad exposure, and the winning population can have a significant bias. This talk will describe our approach to handle this and other challenges to ad impact measurement in this setting, and how we use MCMC Gibbs sampling to arrive at confidence intervals for ad-impact. Bio: Prasad Chalasani is  the S.V.P. of Data Science at MediaMath, leading the development of innovative, proprietary scalable algorithms, and analytics that leverage massive amounts of data to power smarter digital marketing for the world’s leading advertisers. Prior to joining Media Math, Prasad led Data Science at Yahoo Research, and before that worked for 10 years as a quantitative researcher and portfolio manager of statistical trading strategies at hedge funds and at Goldman Sachs. Prasad holds a PhD in Computer Science from CMU and BTech in Computer Science from IIT.","26 Apr 2016","17:00"," ",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

As a result, cities around the world — including the United States — are under greater and greater stress: congestion and pollution; infrastructure in desperate need of repair and expansion, citizens expecting greater access via mobile and the cloud, flat economies, and overly leveraged with debt. One very easily can paint a bleak picture of the urban future. Yet, by combining the innovative insights and spirit of citizens with the technological advances of the 21st century — mobile phones, sensors, GPS, data and advanced analytics, the internet and the cloud — the world is seeing exciting new approaches to these urban challenges.  Join with me in my role as chairman of Global Futures Group and take a look at this future. Together, we can identify new opportunities for growth and change here in NYC and around the world. Join me in learning how you can be one of the growing number of citizens, entrepreneurs, innovators, non-profits, small businesses, and high-tech corporations who are designing and building the smart cities of the coming decade.

It supports highly configurable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of NiFi's key features include a web-based user interface for monitoring and controlling data flows, guaranteed delivery, data provenance, and easy extensibility through custom processor development. These features make NiFi a perfect candidate for building production quality data pipelines that interact with Apache Solr. This talk will demonstrate how to use a NiFi processor that delivers data to a Solr update handler, as well as a processor for extracting data from Solr on regular intervals for delivery to down-stream systems. In addition we will show how these processors can be combined with other built-in NiFi processors to solve a variety of use cases, including log aggregation, and indexing messages received from Kafka.

With MapWarper, we’ll show how to take maps that are only stored as images (e.g., scans of historic maps), place them in the correct virtual geographic context, and view them online. We’ll then turn everyone loose on the University of Pittsburgh’s excellent digital historic maps collection (http://digital.library.pitt.edu/maps/), which includes many amazing but un-georeferenced historic maps of Pittsburgh. See this “urban scratch-off map” (http://chriswhong.github.io/urbanscratchoff/) for an example of a fun way to interact with georeferenced historic maps.

Often by the time a solution is in place, the business needs have changed. With all the talk about Agile development methods like SCRUM and Extreme Programming, the question arises as to how these approaches can be used to deliver data warehouse and business intelligence projects faster. This presentation will look at the 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto and see how they can be applied in the context of a data warehouse project. The goal is to determine a method or methods to get a more rapid (2-4 weeks) delivery of portions of an enterprise data warehouse architecture. Real world examples with metrics will be discussed.

I was able to talk enough to answer screening questions. Most job fairs are 60 second stand up things with handing a resume, saying what kind of position by title and leaving it at that (along with a line 10 deep behind me). Your event allowed several minutes, and I think that is much better to explain why (the effort is being shut down by the government) and brief expectations on both sides. Many booths seemed to have a technical person and not just HR, which is excellent to eliminate disconnects regarding skills / buzzwords.” ”It was a great experience I had a chance to speak with hiring managers and recruiters. I will definitely be coming to the next event. I would say to anyone that would like to attend should, it is something that is worth while it is something new, much better than the traditional job fair.” ”reStart does a great job - best I have attended” ”My first time attending a reStart event. I thought the most impactful feature was allowing companies to review resumes ahead of time and schedule morning interviews. I received two interviews, and was able to discuss how my skills will benefit those companies in a 1-on-1 environment. It shortens the overall timeline for both recruiter and job seeker.” ”it was one of the best setup job fairs i have ever attended” ”This was the best part of the event!

You've no doubt heard plenty about such features as Query Store, JSON support, Polybase, and the other big-ticket items. But there are also a number of very cool features that don't usually make the top 10 lists. In this talk you'll learn about enhancements to indexing (including both Columnstore and traditional b-tree indexes), DMVs, compression, string handling, encryption, configuration, and even timezone support. These smaller features may not be highlighted in the latest glossy ads from Microsoft's marketing department, but they're the kinds of things that add up to make your life easier.

These include HDFS (disastor recovery), S3, NFS, FTP, Kafka, JMS. Ingesting petabytes of data at scale in the native Hadoop environment encounters quite a few problems that need to be handled by a platform. Some of the known issues include handling of failure, parallel reading of the data and considering updates while the data is being ingested.

This becomes all the more necessary when processing live data streams where maintaining SLA is paramount. Furthermore, multiple different computations make up an application and each of them may have different partitioning needs. Partitioning also needs to adapt to changing data rates, input sources and other application requirements like SLA. In this talk we will introduce how Apex, a distributed data-in-motion platform on Hadoop, handles partitioning. We will look at different partitioning schemes provided by Apex some of which are unique in this space. We will also look at how Apex does dynamic partitioning, a feature unique to and pioneered by Apex to handle varying data needs with examples. We will also talk about the different utilities and libraries that Apex provides for users to be able to affect their own custom partitioning.

146878,183103,19650402,"231182837","Apache Apex is a native Hadoop data-in-motion platform that is used for ingestion, transformations, fast real-time analytics, ETL, disastor recovery, etc.  Processing big data often requires running the same computations parallelly in multiple processes or threads, called partitions, with each partition handling a subset of the data. This becomes all the more necessary when processing live data streams where maintaining SLA is paramount. Furthermore, multiple different computations make up an application and each of them may have different partitioning needs. Partitioning also needs to adapt to changing data rates, input sources and other application requirements like SLA. In this talk we will introduce how Apex, a distributed data-in-motion platform on Hadoop, handles partitioning. We will look at different partitioning schemes provided by Apex some of which are unique in this space. We will also look at how Apex does dynamic partitioning, a feature unique to and pioneered by Apex to handle varying data needs with examples. We will also talk about the different utilities and libraries that Apex provides for users to be able to affect their own custom partitioning.

A third question is “What genetic code can we engineer into a living creature to make it immune to all known viruses?” Our technical challenge is to integrate short DNA (oligonucleotide) synthesis, larger scale DNA assembly (to multiple kilobase pairs), on-chip expression (cellular and cell-free options), and diverse assays to quantify the encoded functions. Our approach to this integration is to miniaturize and connect these processes using microfluidics. I will present our current progress toward this vision of the BPU.

We can make it compare images, clump together at-risk students, and even predict the weather. In this talk, you’ll get an overview of search internals. But we’ll quickly switch to subverting search for our nefarious purposes.

To do this, Doug uses Solr/Elasticsearch, sprinkling a little natural language processing and machine learning on top for good measure.  Doug makes a big difference for companies like O'Reilly Media and Advance Auto Parts. Doug's secret weapon is enabling non-technical product owners, business, and domain experts to take deeper control of their search. Through writing and speaking Doug wants to humanize search and recommendations, making these topic less intimidating for everyone: developers, non-technical folks, and users. Doug loves building tools to help with search relevancy, including Quepid, Splainer and Elyzer.

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/rdbms-nosql For the past 25 years, applications have been getting built using an RDBMS with a predefined schema which forces data to conform with a schema on-write. Many people still think that they must use an RDBMS for applications even though records in their datasets have no relation to one another. Additionally, RDBMS databases are typically optimized for transactional use, and data must be exported for analytics purposes. NoSQL technologies have turned that model on its side to deliver groundbreaking performance improvements. In this presentation, we will walk through a music database with over 100 tables in the schema and show how to convert that model over for use with a NoSQL database. You will learn how to handle creating, updating and deleting records, using column families for different types of data (and why). You will also learn how to leverage Apache Drill's ANSI-SQL capabilities on the NoSQL database to use the exact same data without moving or transforming it to perform analytics. Jim Scott, Director of Enterprise Strategy &amp; Architecture, MapR James A. Scott (who prefers to go by Jim) is Director of Enterprise Strategy &amp; Architecture at MapR Technologies and is very active in the Hadoop community. Jim helped build the Hadoop community in Chicago as cofounder of the Chicago Hadoop Users Group. He has implemented Hadoop at three different companies, supporting a variety of enterprise use cases from managing Points of Interest for mapping applications, to Online Transactional Processing in advertising, as well as full data center monitoring and general data processing. Jim also was the SVP of Information Technology and Operations at SPINS, the leading provider of retail consumer insights, analytics reporting and consulting services for the Natural and Organic Products industry. Additionally, Jim served as Lead Engineer/Architect for Conversant (formerly Dotomi), one of the world's largest and most diversified digital marketing companies, and also held software architect positions at several companies including Aircell, NAVTEQ, and Dow Chemical.

148795,194695,15805062,"229515440"," AODC Mission Statement: Open data is new name given to a timeless concept: it is information accessible by anyone. Open data is a growing global resource with potential to grow business, improve quality of government service, and increase innovation in healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, gender equality. The Africa Open Data Community is a convening space for tech industry, small businesses, journalists, civic tech, entrepreneurs, researchers, students, IT solution providers, banks, telcoms, insurance companies, NGO's, donor organizations, and local and national governments to connect virtually and in person to share advances in open data, share lessons, and form new collaborations.  We seek a transparent, open dialogue and concrete action on common challenges and shared solutions for communities and partners across Africa. Open data can generate jobs, build business confidence, make government more transparent, and revitalize communities. • Open data from satellites can inventory agricultural production, help farmers improve yields, and improve financial results. • Open data about transportation networks can improve freight delivery, tourism, and public safety.   • Open health data can help consumers understand the capacities, costs, and potential outcomes of healthcare in their communities. • And open climate data can help nations prepare for climate change and improve social and economic adaptation. • Journalists can use open data to reveal new patterns of social, economic, and scientific discovery to tell new stories and help communities understand their world. • Private Industry can publish open data and engage with civic leaders to empower women and transform conditions that are good for business and society. Data is a tool to achieve the goals that matter to people, business, and government.  Working with this tool requires new skills and old common sense. AODC events provide both and engage people, civil society, journalists, and the private sector in a public dialog about the power of open data to transform our communities, governments, and businesses.  All of us can lead, partner, and work together to collect, publish, and share open data resources to drive sustainable development. Africa must diversify its economies, increase economic participation, and empower women  - and data is an untapped resource that can generate tremendous economic opportunity. It can open up trade, improve agricultural production, reduce hunger and poverty, make service delivery more efficient, empower women, and help us all prepare for climate change. AODC: Open Sustainable Development Data Day At the edges of the regional gathering of Open Government Partnership, AODC will host a day event to share government and organizational experiences in developing and institutionalizing open data policies, will tackle a few of the Sustainable Development Goals including water and agriculture to determine how open data can be most useful in achieving the targets, and highlight the untapped leadership role of the private sector in sourcing and using quality open data for Africa.  This event is for journalists, civic technologists, IT solution providers, banks, telecommunications companies, insurance companies, NGO's, and local and national governments to roll up their sleeves and collaborate in workshops and interactive discussions. In 2015, more than 190 world leaders committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to help us all end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change. We each have a role to play if we’re going to achieve these goals of a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world.  In this event, we are focusing on the role of open data in advancing two of the global Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Gender inequalities are still deeply rooted in every society. Many women lack access to employment opportunities, basic education, and health care, and are often subjected to violence and discrimination. The math is simple: in countries where there's higher gender equality, there's less poverty, more economic growth, and a higher standard of living. Investing in women-run businesses produces the greatest return for growth and stability in other sectors within local communities and banking institutions are repaid loans in full at an average 97% far higher than the mean.  Let's improve opportunities for everyone by dismantling barriers to women's participation in economic, social and political life. SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts The world's industrialised nations have changed the balance of the earth's carbon cycle over the last 150 years by burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Climate change has the potential to derail other efforts toward sustainable development by altering weather patterns that threaten our food production and increasing sea levels which will displace coastal communities. Extreme weather threatens livelihoods and lives of people across the globe and across the continent Africa is undergoing a severe water crisis.  We need to increase awareness of the causes of and grow solutions that combat and adapt to climate crisis for individuals and world leaders before it is too late. SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions In the age of global connectivity, the ability to grow industry and improve livelihoods is dependent on the quality, accuracy, and speed of information.  Open government institutions working with well-trained storytellers and journalists can improve the dissemination of knowledge needed to spur innovation and growth from advancements in public transportation and road infrastructure to ensuring city and rural health centers are well stocked with supplies.  The rise of “infomediaries” ensures that the needs of people and clients are well understood and shared and that services that industry and government provide are reaching the intended destination.  Using improved data can greatly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of governments and supports stronger institutions that serve us all. https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gGJ_TyblO4P2PcjdFPsZJjQZoyjZerMoDNUpAkZikDzMQcUiy-2wn84jR5o0HjuAJI3t7aKJXAIBQoXYtter3DywHMuJ1AMCKREyLCqRupRAZ1A_OArw4DXyGbAYPfubDaDOaMRl AGENDA 8:30 - Who is the Africa Open Data Community?

Instead of looking at a specific SQL Server technology, we will look at data modeling techniques.  Because as we all know, if the data model isn't correct, all the technology in the world won't help! Bridging the Gap With Business Data Objects Abstract: When data modeling first evolved as a discipline, the primary focus was to specify the definition and format of data, enabling the development of information systems. As corporate environments have become very complex, data architecture has shifted to provide integration between and across many systems, as well as a foundation for data warehouses, business intelligence, and analytics. This session discusses the concept of business data objects (BDOs), and how they can add clarity as a logical and physical modeling construct, through to physical implementation in architectural frameworks, and serve as a common basis to facilitate discussion of real-world concepts with business stakeholders. Idera will be providing the refreshments for this meeting.

152195,185110,1482573,"226656489","Apache Solr has moved beyond it’s roots as just a full text search engine. Today people are leveraging it for aggregating data, powering dashboards, even building knowledge graphs. As the underlying data manipulation has become more robust, now we need better ways of working with that data then just the browser based query. This talk is going to cover one of the new ways of interaction with Solr, using Spark. We’ll go through how to make Solr be a RDD: Resilient Distributed Dataset, and do some Spark jobs. I’ll mention some of the use cases for Spark, ranging from “comparing data sets” to “calculating average reading level of text”. Lastly, we’ll look at Apache Zeppelin, which aims to be the “interactive data analytics notebook” of the Big Data world. We’ll use Zeppelin to play with some data in Solr. BioFascinated by the “craft” of software development, Eric Pugh has been heavily involved in the open source world as a developer, committer, and user for the past 10 years. He is a member of the Apache Software Foundation and lately has been mulling over how we move our expectations for search from “10 blue links” to “remarkably right”. In biotech, financial services and defense IT, he has helped European and American companies develop coherent strategies for embracing open source software. As a speaker he has advocated the advantages of Agile practices in software development. Eric became involved in Solr in 2007 when he submitted SOLR-284, the patch for Parsing Rich Documents such as PDF and MS Office, which subsequently became the single most popular patch as measured by community votes! The patch was subsequently cleaned up and enhanced by three other individuals, demonstrating the power of the Free/Open Source Model to build great code collaboratively. SOLR-284 was eventually refactored into Solr Cell as part of Solr version 1.4. Eric co-authored ""Solr Enterprise Search Server"", the first book on Solr.

Statistical modeling is rooted in parsimony, significance and model interpretation. Machine Learning (ML) models are prolific in their data usage and are generally opaque to human interpretation which makes them unsuited to many financial tasks. Machine learning algorithms can make use of large datasets with millions of features (independent variables) and billions of rows of data.  This allows for the use of very large and sparse datasets to create accurate predictions at the expense of simplicity and interpretability. In this talk we will investigate the application of machine learning techniques to produce valuation estimates for single family residences (SFR). Single family residences are a $25 trillion asset class in the U.S. representing approximately 120 million properties. This asset class also underpins the the $12 trillion mortgage backed securities market. We will see how machine learning models are well suited to this domain. We will examine a sample data set and build prediction algorithms along with calculating accuracy measures and compare them to the corresponding Zestimate from Zillow. Bios Ritesh Bansal has worked for over 18 years in the financial industry. He spent over a decade on the buy side building and trading models for statistical, index arbitrage and high frequency trading. He now consults for banks and hedge funds at his consultancy Rational Insights. He graduated with a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science from CMU. Zhuo Yin graduated with B.S. in Computer Science from Xiangtan University and a M.S. also in Computer Science from NYU. He has built algorithmic trading engines and distributed data stores for analytics and modeling. His passion is to create innovative machine learning systems for prediction from large data stores.","11 May 2016","18:30","101 Barclay Str., 10FL-East Auditorium New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

152298,186673,19037273,"230755099","Topic:  Spark for Reactive Machine Learning: Building Intelligent Agents at Scale Presenter: Jeff Smith, Data Engineering Lead - x.ai Abstract: If you want to build an intelligent agent, the first thing that you're going to need is a lot of data. Then, the second thing that you're going to need is some way to process all that data. Enter Apache Spark, the biggest thing to happen to big data since Hadoop MapReduce. With Spark, its machine learning libraries, and related projects, you can learn machine learning models over arbitrarily-sized datasets. This talk will be a technical exploration of different aspects of building a large scale machine learning system like an intelligent agent. The focus will be on using Spark and related tools to build machine learning systems that stay responsive in the face of errors or changes in scale. These sorts of considerations are crucial for any team looking to build an agent who is expected to be always available and always learning. You can build just a truly reactive system to support an intelligent agent. This talk will show you how to do so by harnessing the power of Apache Spark and other important open source libraries. Keynote Speaker Bio: Jeff Smith builds large-scale machine learning systems using Scala and Spark. For the past decade, he has been working on data science applications at various startups in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. He’s a frequent blogger and the author of “Reactive Machine Learning Systems,” an upcoming book from Manning on how to build real-world machine learning systems using Scala, Akka, and Spark. He leads the data engineering team at x.ai, building Amy, an artificial intelligence who schedules meetings.

In his speech, he guides us through the emerging global network civilization in which mega-cities compete over connectivity more than borders. His journeys take us from Ukraine to Iran, Mongolia to North Korea, Panama City to Dubai, and the Arctic Circle to the South China Sea, to show how 21st century conflict is a tug-of-war over pipelines and Internet cables, advanced technologies and market access.

Paradoxically, the scale of the climate crisis is such that it tends to drive inaction, at a time when mass action is urgently required to avoid catastrophe. This work compares the unfolding crisis to a hospital emergency room, in which data and information are used to immediately treat a patient with the highest possible sense of urgency. Insulin Insulin is a responsive data visualization reading a real-time feed of blood glucose values from a sensor worn on the artist’s body. The artist uses this data every day to treat his chronic Type 1 Diabetes. The visualizations explore the psychology associated with the numbers, with the efficacy of treatment leading to guilt, fear, or pride in daily decisions. Existential Existential is a 3D depth video exploring our relationship with our daily surroundings in built-up urban environments.

Deep Learning is the process of learning an Artificial Neural Network. Deep Learning falls under the sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence called Representation Learning. Conventional ML algorithms are limited in their ability to process raw data and rather need domain specific features extracted from the data which can be hard to do.  Representation Learning works on raw data and solves this problem internally giving Deep Learning methods an edge over conventional ML methods. Although there has been work on ANNs since 1960s, they have gained momentum again in the recent few years. The reason of this being an increase of sizes of current datasets and a boost in computational power due to parallel processing in GPUs. Deep Learning has produced some record breaking results in the past few years in various problems including hand-written digit identification, and digital object recognition (ImageNet). In my talk, I would like to discuss about how Deep Learning achieves this success, why it is better than conventional ML algorithms for many problems, challenges involved in learning a deep neural network and optimized methods for deep learning, and newer modifications to conventional neural networks (CNNs, Auto-Encoders, etc.).","16 May 2016","17:30","185 Hudson st, suite 1620, plaza 5 Jersey City",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

Food and drinks will be provided.How Predictable is Information Diffusion?How does information spread in online social networks and how predictable are online diffusion events? Despite a great deal of existing research on modeling information diffusion and predicting success in social systems, these questions have remained largely unanswered for a variety of reasons. These reasons range from the inability to observe most word-of-mouth communication, to difficulties in precisely and consistently formalizing different notions of success.  This talk will attempt to clarify these issues through an empirical analysis of billions of diffusion events under one simple but unified framework. Jake will show that despite stable regularities in aggregate diffusion patterns, it remains surprisingly difficult to predict the success of any particular individual or piece of content in an online social network – with his best performing models explaining only half of the empirical variance in outcomes. He'll conclude by exploring this limit theoretically through a series of simulations that suggest that it is the diffusion process itself, rather than our ability to estimate or model it, that is responsible for this unpredictability.  Speaker Bio:Jake Hofman is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research in New York City, where his work in computational social science involves applications of statistics and machine learning to large-scale social data. Prior to joining Microsoft, he was a member of the Microeconomics and Social Systems group at Yahoo! Research. Jake is also an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, where he has designed and taught classes on a number of topics ranging from biological physics to applied machine learning.

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/iot-big-data Over 4,000 U.S. workers die on the job every year, and more than 3 million get injured. New wearable technologies are aggressively entering consumer applications (Fitbit, Skully, Apple Watch) but industrial safety equipment has not seen any fundamental innovation in the last decade. GuardHat addresses this issue with its ""smart hard hat ecosystem"", essentially an IoT device in a hard hat form factor. GuardHat is an industrial wearable that uses IoT and wireless communications systems to protect and empower industrial workers. By collecting and analyzing sensor-based data, GuardHat blends existing and emerging technologies to prevent safety incidents and to intervene more effectively when incidents happen. The GuardHat ecosystem includes a comprehensive Big Data software platform that gathers large volumes of sensor and M2M data, and analyzes this data stream in real-time using a Complex Event Processing engine to detect and act upon potential safety events. The architecture is modular and scalable to address future application integrations and flexibility in deployment. Reliability and performance are key, and the dynamic nature of the usage scenarios dictates the need for a rapid development toolset, all of which are addressed by HPCC Systems. The GuardHat open platform can also deploy additional applications involving real-time access to the front line workforce. Preliminary analyses indicate that up to 20% of severe incidents could be prevented by GuardHat which is a potential market-value savings of $30-50 billion per year based on U.S. businesses incurring over $250 billion in annual safety related costs. Anupam Sengupta, Co-Founder &amp; CTO, GuardHat  Anupam is a co-founder and the CTO of GuardHat. Previously, Anupam served as the CIO of Severstal North America, a subsidiary of OAO Severstal, a global metals and mining company.

Exploring 2015 World University Rankings By Ho Fai Wong Several organizations such as the ARWU, THE and CWUR score and rank universities across the globe. What were the ‘best’ universities in the world in 2015? How do these results differ by ranking organization? This Shiny application attempts to explore these and other questions related to the 2015 world university rankings. 2. Cost of Living Estimator Between Cities By Joseph Wang In the past few years, I have traveled across the country as a postdoctoral and industrial researcher. This is in part due to the harshness of the permanent academic environment, and also the down turn in the energy industry, especially back in my home town of Houston, Texas. The most immediately need for my family is to look for a new job opportunity near an area which is affordable for long term living. It occurs to me that it would be great to have a Shiny application in R, which will be useful for people who want to or need to relocate. My goal is to show some facts that may go against intuition about how things should work on the matter of cost of living standards and salary ranges in different cities. On the other hand, I also would like to examine if the income for data scientists is paid fairly according to living standards, and hopefully make a suggestion on top cities for data scientists in terms of realistic aspects of life. 3. Food and health demographics in the USA By Yannick Kimmel Obesity affects roughly 1 in 3 Americans, while diabetes affects roughly 1 in 10 Americans. The scope of this project is to explore the relationship of food and economic factors in the US' counties. Data was taken from the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. The diversity (or variance) of factors across counties allows for correlations in obesity rates to be developed. Users can map health indicators across the US, explore the relationship among different factors, and predict how changes in demographic factors will affect obesity rates. 4. New York City Cultural Institutions By Robert Castellano Robert created a Shiny app that gives organizes the information of cultural institutions in New York. This is designed to both connect users with the institutions they are interested in, as well as discover greater trends in culture across the city. 5. NYC Complaints by Borough By Kelly Mejia Breton NYC Complaints by Borough is a quick reference tool to aid users with their planning, grounded on the complaints reported in NYC. 6. Panama Papers By Ruonan Ding The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists releases on May 9, 2016 a searchable database with information on more than 200,000 offshore entities that are part of the Panama Papers investigation. The data comes from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, one of the top players in the offshore world, and includes information about companies, trusts, foundations and funds incorporated in 21 tax havens, from Hong Kong to Nevada in the United States. It links to people in more than 200 countries and territories.

This becomes all the more necessary when processing live data streams where maintaining SLA is paramount. Furthermore, multiple different computations make up an application and each of them may have different partitioning needs. Partitioning also needs to adapt to changing data rates, input sources and other application requirements like SLA. In this talk we will introduce how Apex, a distributed data-in-motion platform on Hadoop, handles partitioning. We will look at different partitioning schemes provided by Apex some of which are unique in this space. We will also look at how Apex does dynamic partitioning, a feature unique to and pioneered by Apex to handle varying data needs with examples.

FileMaker Go 15’s native iBeacon functionality makes this type of application relatively easy to design and implement. J. Sciarra from Colibri Solutions will demonstrate this functionality and discuss various use cases, opportunities, and limitations of what this new FileMaker capability can provide. 2) FileMaker 15 round table What is new in FileMaker 15?

There will be a short lecture that includes an introduction to Spark, the Spark components. Spark is a unified framework for big data analytics. Spark provides one integrated API for use by developers, data scientists, and analysts to perform diverse tasks that would have previously required separate processing engines such as batch analytics, stream processing and statistical modeling. Spark supports a wide range of popular languages including Python, R, Scala, SQL, and Java. Spark can read from diverse data sources and scale to thousands of nodes. The lecture will be followed by demo . There will be a short lecture on Hadoop and how Spark and Hadoop interact and compliment each other. You will learn how to move data into HDFS using Spark APIs, create Hive table, explore the data with Spark and SQL, transform the data and then issue some SQL queries. We will be using Scala and/or PySpark for labs. Users have 2 options to follow along with the demo labs.

Our instructor will be teaching us remotely through a live stream, so you can attend ONLINE or IN-PERSON.

Crowdcast is supported on the latest browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Android browsers. It's not yet supported by Safari. This includes iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. All things equal, Google Chrome tends to work best.  *********************************************** INSTRUCTOR: Before getting into the tech industry and moving to California, Haseeb Qureshi was a professional poker player and a non-CS major (he majored in English). He later enrolled in App Academy—a top coding bootcamp in San Francisco—and graduated at the top of his class. He immediately joined the bootcamp's core team as an instructor, teaching their entire algorithms curriculum, and he was later promoted to Director of Product. 9 months after graduating, Haseeb wanted to transition into becoming a full-time developer, but initially his job applications were rejected at the first 20+ companies he applied for. Things turned around after a few weeks as he started receiving job offers from Google, Yelp, Stripe, Uber, and Airbnb, where he now works as a software engineer.

A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/graph In this talk, you will learn the fundamentals of graph database technology and how to leverage its power to gain new insights from your data. We will also explore the next wave of graph technology and discuss what to expect in the future of scalable graph databases. The ability to make connections in the world around us is a fundamental advantage of our humanity. The more efficiently we can make sense of the things around us, the stronger/faster/better we can be. Now, imagine applying that thinking to your business and using those data-relationships to make connections between individual data records, thus transforming the data that you already have into something much more powerful. When you store data as a network of interconnected relationships, new insights arise that were not previously possible with traditional data-stores. As a result, data is transformed so that recommendations become more precise, network dependencies are mapped and tracked in real time, and it becomes the norm to have 360 degree views of a customer.

He's happy to help.   Abstracts Ritesh Bansal and Jim Schmitz, Meta Analysis for Predicting Election Outcomes. Meta-analysis is a powerful technique that can be applied to different domains like sports, markets, elections, etc. Nate Silver achieved great success in forecasting the U.S. presidential race by predicting 49/50 states correctly in 2008 and all 50 states correctly in 2012. This achievement is even more impressive as many savvy political consultants called the race incorrectly until election night 2012. Nate Silver's model is outlined on the 538 site and is based on meta-analysis with a series of adjustments. His model is a textbook example of using small-data to make big predictions. In this talk we walk through the model using an IPython notebook. Ritesh Bansal studied math and computer science at CMU and econometrics at the Graduate Center of City College. He has worked for over 15 years in the financial industry building and trading models and consulting for hedge funds and banks in risk management. He founded Rational Insights in 2012 to apply machine learning expertise to the domains of finance and politics. Jim Schmitz studied math and computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and math and finance at NYU-Courant. He has worked at several hedge funds and investment banks doing quantitative research and trading. He is interested in politics and prediction markets, and once built a computer program to act as a market maker in the Iowa Electronic Markets. He published a research paper on the results, titled ""Algorithmic Trading in the Iowa Electronic Markets.” Lev Konstantinovskiy, Word embeddings for fun and profit with gensim. Word embeddings is a family of modern neural network techniques for analysing raw text. In this talk we will show how to use several of these algorithms - word2vec, doc2vec, deep inverse regression and word movers distance. The algorithms will assign a genre to a movie plot with various degrees of success. All examples will be using an open-source Natural Language Processing package gensim. Lev is community manager of an open source Natural Language Processing Python package Gensim aka ""Topic modelling for humans"". In the past he counted microseconds in trading and did algebraic geometry . He starts every day with a couple of hours of yoga. Tony Fast, The Internet Killed the Lab Notebook. Open Source Software is significantly impacting scientific research.  Advanced analytics and high performance computing have lower barriers to entry than before.  These tools must exist - and they must be accessible - to solve the increasingly difficult real world problems scientists face everyday.  Massive scientific collaborations are happening at internet scale.  And nearly all other scientific organizations are feeling the pressure to make that transition.  Using new tools for a scientist is a big decision and the open source software world is a confusing place.  On the journey to digital science, many are going to discover NumFocus sponsorship projects will be in their toolbelt; as many began as scientific research.  This talk will expand on the impacts of the PyData community and open source software as it pertains to the modern scientist.  Tony Fast is a Community Scientist at Continuum Analytics; he is also Co-Founder of PyData Atlanta.  He uses open source software and the scientific methods to solve everything from Generalized Spherical Harmonics to putting together pizza orders for meetups.  Tony still lives, eats, and breathes science even after crawling out of academia.  He has taught Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, recieved his Ph.D. in Materials Science from Drexel University, and Bachelor's in Ceramic Engineering at Rutgers University.","25 May 2016","18:00","156 5th Ave New York",1,"data, learn, science, use, talk, model, computation, machina, visual, work"

156442,192130,4440352,"227849718"," American Philosophy, Pragmatism, and the creator of Modern Semiotics, the polymath Charles S. Peirce (1839 – 1914)  The initiator of the only home grown American philosophy, Pragmatism, and the creator of modern semiotics, the polymath Charles S. Peirce (1839 – 1914), worked for a time at formalizing, as a new applied science, his theory of three universal categories, these pervading his work in phenomenology, semiotic, ontology, and many other sciences. He expected this science, trichotomic, to usher in “a new birth of time” much as Aristotle's philosophy had done centuries earlier. This author has developed trikonic as a diagrammatic explication of Peirce's science, but which also expands it in several directions. The hope is that this more iconic expression of Peirce's three-category theory will demonstrate its value in many applications; its basic themes will be explored here. It seems to me that we are driven to this, that logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. They must not stop at our own fate, but must embrace the whole community. This community, again, must not be limited, but must extend to all races of beings with whom we can come into immediate or mediate intellectual relation. It must reach, however vaguely, beyond this geological epoch, beyond all bounds. He who would not sacrifice his own soul to save the whole world, is, as it seems to me, illogical in all his inferences, collectively. Logic is rooted in the social principle— “The Doctrine of Chances” Gary Richmond is on the Humanities Faculty of LaGuardia College, CUNY, where he teaches in the philosophy and communication studies areas. At the college's Center for Teaching and Learning he created faculty development seminars on information literacy, e-portfolio, and writing/speaking/critical thinking across the curriculum. His intellectual interests are centered in the thought of the creator of modern semiotics, Charles S. Peirce, founder also of philosophical pragmatism. He co-manages Arisbe, the Peirce “gateway” website, and moderates its companion e-forum, PEIRCE-L, recently co-editing a special edition of Transactions of the Charles S.

156638,193690,11398322,"230555338","We're very happy to have John Allspaw, CTO of Etsy and author, presenting on Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity by Klein, Feltovich, and Woods. Intro  The paper I'm going to discuss is the result of what happens when people with backgrounds in mathematics, psychology, and artificial intelligence (Feltovich and Bradshaw) get together to ask questions about how teams operate alongside the originators of modern decision-making and cognitive systems engineering research (Klein and Woods).  The concepts outlined in the paper have provided frames and directions in designing tools and environments where successful work requires multiple actors (whether they are people or software agents!) to succeed. This seminal paper takes a deep dive into not just people and teamwork, but what comprises the sometimes invisible activity of coordination, collaboration, cooperation, and the contracts and expectations entities have with each other along the way.  The paper has had far-reaching influence in multiple domains: military intelligence, space transportation and aviation, and more recently: software engineering and operations on the web. Let me walk you through where this paper came from, what makes this paper critical to the future of software, and a hint about what I'm sure it means about the future.  Bio John Allspaw (@allspaw) is Etsy’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), leading the Product Engineering, Infrastructure and Operations teams. Previously, he was SVP of Infrastructure and Operations at Etsy. For over 17 years, he has worked in system operations in the biotech, government and online media industries. He began his career running vehicle crash simulations for the U.S. government. In 1997, he made the leap to the web, building the technical infrastructures at Salon, InfoWorld, Friendster and Flickr. John is the author of The Art of Capacity Planning and Web Operations: Keeping the Data On Time, both published by O’Reilly Media. He holds a BS from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and an MSC from Lund University. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  TwoSigma - Platinum Sponsor of the New York chapter ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Details Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be refreshments of all kinds and pizza. A little different than previous PWLs, you'll have to check-in with security with your Name/ID. Definitely sign-up if you’re going to attend–unfortunately people whose names aren’t entered into the security system in advance won’t be allowed in.  After John presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.   We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't. If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit #pwlnyc on slack, our GitHub repository, where you can also find the paper, or add to the discussion on this event's thread.

You will get a lot out of this intense day, and you will walk away with concrete usage examples and of cour se some excellent networking with your SQL Server peers. 8:45 AM Registration 9:00 AM Introduction 9:30 AM Presentations 10:30 AM Break 10:45 AM Presentations Continuation 11:30 AM Breaking into Groups/Idea Development 12:30 PM Lunch 1:00 PM Solution Development 2:30 PM Break 4:00 PM Show &amp; Tell 4:45 PM Wrapping Up 5:00 PM Close *Schedule is subject to change without notice.","24 May 2016","09:00","30 Isabella St # 202 Pittsburgh",3,"data, will, please, help, free, learn, day, can, follow, meet"
