The lake is in Long Pond Ironworks State Park, and is known for its old stone walls, furnaces and other remnants of a once industrious ironworking community that now sits next to the swiftly flowing Wanaque River. Being a flat water lake this tour is perfect for the beginner. Want a nice long paddle,\u00a0visit the 505-acre Monksville Reservoir that encircles Long Pond Ironworks State Park like a giant horseshoe. You\u2019ll find the most interesting paddling on the far side of the reservoir, where coves of all sizes form a continuous string along the highly irregular shoreline.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/225942160\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytnbhc","time":1445788800000,"updated":1445800509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"alpine","address_1":"state line lookout","name":"Lookout Inn   State Line Lookout Alpine, NJ","lon":-73.90696,"id":2440551,"state":"NJ","lat":40.98542,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":14,"headcount":8,"distance":16.8690223694,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445311592000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Moderate Hike on the Palisades this Sunday 10\/24.

Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.<\/p> <p>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This book is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0316229296\/\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin\/1117543436\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/store.kobobooks.com\/en-us\/ebook\/the-fifth-season-11\">Kobo<\/a>, digital or otherwise.<\/p> <p>* * *<\/p> <p><br\/>IMPORTANT RSVP POLICY<\/p> <p>If you RSVP and find you cannot make it, please change your RSVP so that we are not waiting for you.

At the beginning of the story, Amelia says she is considering quitting online dating. How would you compare the act of buying books online to the act of dating online? Is it relevant to the story that Amelia meets her eventual husband in a very analog location, a bookstore?\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. Consider the setting. Why do you think the author chooses to set the book on an island? How does the island setting reflect A.J.\u2019s character?<\/p> <p>\u00a03. Perhaps oddly, vampires are a recurring motif in the story: for example, when A.J.\u2019s wife throws the vampire prom and when A.J. watches True Blood to court Amelia. What do you make of the references to vampires?\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. Lambiase moves from an occasional or nonreader, to a reader, to a bookseller. How do you think becoming a reader changes him? Consider the scene where he decides not to confront Ismay about the backpack. Do you think Lambiase\u2019s reaction is different than it would have been if he hadn\u2019t taken up reading?\u00a0<\/p> <p>5. The author chooses to begin each chapter with a description of a short story. Discuss some of the ways the stories relate to the chapters with which they are paired. Is A.J. creating a canon for Maya? How does the book itself function as a kind of canon? If these are A.J.\u2019s favorites, what do they say about A.J. as a reader and as a man?<\/p> <p>\u00a06. Did you find Ismay\u2019s motivations for stealing Tamerlane to be forgivable? How do you think she should pay for her crime? Why do you think Lambiase lets her off?<\/p> <p>\u00a07. At one point, Maya speculates that perhaps \u201cyour whole life is determined by what store you get left in\u201d (page 85). Is it the people or the place that makes the difference?\u00a0<\/p> <p>8. When did you become aware that Leon Friedman might be an imposter? What did you make of Leonora Ferris's reasons for hiring him?<\/p> <p>\u00a09. How do you think Daniel Parrish might have changed if he had lived? Do you think some people never change?\u00a0<\/p> <p>10. Were you surprised by the outcome of the short story contest? What do you think of A.J.\u2019s comments to Maya about why certain books and stories win prizes and others don\u2019t? Does the knowledge that a book has won a prize attract you to reading it?<\/p> <p>11. Compare Maya\u2019s \"fiction\" about the last day of her mother\u2019s life to Ismay\u2019s version. Which do you consider to be more accurate and why?<\/p> <p>12. How do you think the arrival of the e-reader is related to the denouement of the story? Is A.J. a man who cannot exist in a world with e-books? What do you think of e-books? Do you prefer reading in e- or on paper?\u00a0<\/p> <p>13. On page 159, A.J. asks Maya, \u201cIs a twist less satisfying if you know it\u2019s coming? Is a twist that you can\u2019t predict symptomatic of bad construction?\u201d What do you think of this statement in view of the plot of The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry? Did you guess who Maya's father was? If so, what were the clues?<\/p> <p>14. The author chooses to end the novel with a new sales rep coming to an Island Books that is no longer owned by A.J. What do you make of this ending?\u00a0<\/p> <p>15. What do you think the future holds for physical books and bookstores?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Usually in the room to the right of the registers.

Due in part to advances in rapid prototyping, developments in 3D printing, and the integration of the Internet of Things, entrepreneurs can test and iterate a product to bring it to market with relatively few resources. This panel discussion brings together a technologist, an artist, and an expert in the business of 3D printing to discuss how these rapid prototyping technologies are affecting their industries and how they envision prototyping evolving in the future.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE PANELISTS:<\/p> <p><br\/>DUANN SCOTT<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/d\/c\/1\/600_443072193.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nDuann \u00a0is a designer, researcher and writer specializing in understanding and communicating complex ideas in a succinct, easy to understand manner, to both educate and inspire.\u00a0 Described by The New York Times as the \u201cPied Piper for on demand 3D Printing,\u201d he has been recognized for his role in bringing 3D printing out of the back rooms of engineering firms, and into mass consciousness.

Due in part to advances in rapid prototyping, developments in 3D printing, and the integration of the Internet of Things, entrepreneurs can test and iterate a product to bring it to market with relatively few resources. This panel discussion brings together a technologist, an artist, and an expert in the business of 3D printing to discuss how these rapid prototyping technologies are affecting their industries and how they envision prototyping evolving in the future.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE PANELISTS:<br\/>DUANN SCOTT is a designer, researcher and writer specializing in understanding and communicating complex ideas in a succinct, easy to understand manner, to both educate and inspire.\u00a0 Described by The New York Times as the \u201cPied Piper for on demand 3D Printing,\u201d he has been recognized for his role in bringing 3D printing out of the back rooms of engineering firms, and into mass consciousness. He has worked with major brands, artists, designers and institutions, as well as high school students and seven year olds, to incorporate 3D printing into their lives in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p><br\/>SCOTT BEIBIN is a self-taught engineer, artist and performer. He's the co-designer of many of the liberation technologies used in The Groucho Fractal Show, a touring live performance focusing on the intersection of science, consciousness and environmental sustainability. He's one of the co-designers of TheMandelBot: Function Is The Key, a RepRap inspired 3D Printer built largely from post-consumer and biodegradable re-purposed materials. His day job is as chief strategist at the Evil Twin Booking Agency \/ The Redefinery of which he is a co-founder. He can hula hoop and play accordion at the same time.<\/p> <p><br\/>ANDREW IPPOLITI is an Electrical Engineer working for BotFactory. He has spent the last 2 years creating a machine that can print and assemble electronic circuits on a desktop. His work includes creating an optical correction system for pick and place as well as coding the algorithms that convert design files to the final output. When not improving the printer's software he plays with 3d printing and prototyping electronics.<\/p> <p><br\/>EREK TINKER is the Director of Business Development for The Spry Group and has been moderating the Future of Series for Pax Solaria. He is interested in the technical, business and cultural implications of new technologies. He loves bringing together diverse views on interesting topics to stimulate engaging conversations. \u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops\/events\/226089097\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"The Future of Rapid Prototyping (Panel Discussion)","id":"226089097","time":1445896800000,"updated":1445903636000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1396546420000,"name":"Free NYC Photography Workshops","group_lon":-74,"id":13710502,"urlname":"Free-NYC-Photography-Workshops","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Photographers & Videographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"New York","address_1":"1260 Amsterdam Ave","name":"Serafina Harlem","lon":-73.958191,"id":24030293,"lat":40.810734,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.52346897125,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443547562000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are invited to come join us again for our new Monthly event, the <b>NeoSoul Monthly Networking Mixer @ Serafina Harlem<\/b>!!!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/3\/a\/600_440968730.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Come join us and our friends at <b>Make It Happen Entertainment<\/b>, while we enjoy the NeoSoul music brought to us by <b>DJ Dan.C.E<\/b>!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/2\/e\/1\/600_440969409.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Serafina Harlem<\/b> features great Italian Cuisine in a laid back, relaxing setting.

He received an excellent education and a fine upbringing. From a very early age, he underwent mystical experiences which already indicated his exceptional destiny. For several years, he was the president of the New York Institute for Psychical Research, and was considered an authority in this field. In 1909, he made contact with the European leaders of the Rosicrucian Order. Having given proof of his integrity and of his knowledge in philosophical and esoteric matters, he was initiated in Toulouse, where he officially received the mission of reactivating the Order in America. Despite encountering numerous obstacles and difficulties, he carried out his mission well, and in conformity with the instructions that were given him by the Rosicrucians of France, he began to put into writing the Rosicrucian teachings. In order to demonstrate the traditional and authentic foundations of the Order, he made it known under the name, \"The Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross.\" In 1915 he was named Imperator, that is, the international leader. After having dedicated his entire life to the service of the Order, Harvey Spencer Lewis passed through transition on August 2, 1939.<\/p> <p>This work, which is dedicated to him, is presented so that you can discover his thoughts through his essays. Though written in the past century, their message is always fresh. They demonstrate the modern spirit and avant-garde nature of this great philosopher and humanist.<\/p> <p><b>All are Welcome!<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City\/events\/225619757\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Circle of Spiritual Inquiry - Rationalism of Reincarnation","id":"fpbtflytnbjc","time":1445898600000,"updated":1445911278000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1344977985000,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":4549022,"urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"173 7th Ave South ","address_2":"Between Perry St & 11th Street","lon":-74.001217,"phone":"212\/243-6046","name":"Empire Szechuan Village","id":1151413,"state":"NY","lat":40.735965,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":8,"distance":1.13615870476,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445183547000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Last time, we had an interesting discussion on friendships and how they get started and develop.

Why is loneliness so difficult to experience?<\/p> <p>3. What circumstances lead to feelings of loneliness and what can you do to overcome or avoid it?<\/p> <p>4. Is loneliness more prevalent now than 100 years ago? Why?<\/p> <p>5. How can you use loneliness to your advantage? In other words, are there any benefits to it?<\/p> <p>6. Social isolation vs. loneliness - are the two necessarily linked?<\/p> <p>As usual, looking forward to a great discussion!<\/p> <p>Note:\u00a0$4 contribution to cover Meetup charges<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/9\/f\/4\/600_117819412.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll have our own table upstairs, as usual","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/West-Village-Dynamic-Discussions-Meetup\/events\/226142131\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Dinner and Discussion at Empire Szechuan Village","id":"226142131","time":1445899500000,"updated":1445993748000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1327165377000,"name":"West Village Dynamic Discussions Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":3143362,"urlname":"West-Village-Dynamic-Discussions-Meetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Conversationalists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07011","country":"us","city":"Clifton","address_1":"Clifton Commons","address_2":"395 Route 3 East","lon":-74.163755,"phone":"973-779-5500","name":"Barnes & Noble","id":1358756,"state":"NJ","lat":40.858433,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":11.8017597198,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445485343000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Wow!

We 1) start with a hypothesis, 2) we analyze the data, 3) we find insights, and then 4) we visualize our thesis. The visualization's purpose: communicate insight.<\/p> <p>I have a theory that the\u00a0opposite process\u00a0leads to far better results: 1) visualize the data and then 2) do everything else.<\/p> <p>The best data visualizations create\u00a0active readers\u00a0who can\u00a0explore datasets\u00a0and develop their own perspective. When we start with visualization, we place ourselves in the shoes of a reader with no context. Instead of proving a point, we force ourselves to create the tools and design appropriate for exploration.<\/p> <p>In short: this means avoiding excel at all costs: make visualizations that help you find insights for your story, not the other way around.<\/p> <p>In this\u00a0talk, we'll discuss the emerging notion of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/explorableexplanations.com\/\">Explorable Explanations<\/a>,\u00a0and why the best visualizations, from the NY Times to Bloomberg, seem to be following a new design paradigm \u2013 one beyond anything that Tufte could have imagined.

Sema told me that she felt this man would come back to her somewhere down the road. Yet she also acknowledged that on another level she was experiencing a fear of loss and that she didn\u2019t feel that there was much hope for the relationship. Sema told me later that evening that she could never seem to hold onto the men that she truly wanted to be with.<\/p> <p>Sema was obviously strung out on the man, but she was very disconnected from the underlying pain that was driving her. Sema\u2019s head was just spinning in circles as she analyzed everything the man said or did and why he wasn\u2019t with her at that time. I could see that the hurt buried within Sema was keeping her attached to the man in a very unhealthy way\u2026<\/p> <p>Does this sound familiar?<\/p> <p>Many of us are struggling to find love. But no matter what we do, love always seems to evade us.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve been there myself and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever find the love that I desired. But I persevered because I was very determined to heal and have someone special in my life. I discovered a series of practices that have enabled me to heal the emotional wounds and to develop a magnetic presence. These practices are making it possible for me to attract more loving partners and to create healthier and more fulfilling relationships. I have now decided to share these practices and understandings so that others can also create more love and intimacy and to attract someone truly special.<\/p> <p><b>Open Your Heart by Healing the Emotional Wounds That Carry Over From Childhood and Past Loves<\/b><br\/>Most of us are still carrying the emotional wounds from our childhood and our past loves. We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives.<\/p> <p><b>Learn to \u201cdigest\u201d the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships.<\/b> Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you.<\/p> <p>Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others.<\/p> <p><b>Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner<\/b><br\/>Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.<\/p> <p>A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness<\/b><br\/>Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with.<\/p> <p><b>Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually<\/b><br\/>Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>Develop Chi Power<\/b><br\/>Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi\/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.<\/p> <p><b>Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships<\/b><br\/>Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to \u201cdigest\u201d our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.<\/p> <p>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

We age faster and suffer many health problems when we do not know how to listen to what our body is telling us.<br\/>Discover the amazing wisdom that resides within your own body. Ben will show you how to develop your sensory awareness. Learn to truly listen to your body and care for its needs.<br\/><b>Stimulate the mind's creative problem solving capabilities by learning to \"digest\" issues, emotions and stresses<\/b><br\/>Many of us have never learned how to work with difficult issues and emotions. We tend to push these things down inside of ourselves. Undigested thoughts, issues, emotions and the stresses of daily life create a residue that accumulates within the tissues and organs of our bodies. That creates a great deal of additional stress upon our body and mind. These stresses can arrest our process of development, disconnect us from the divine creative intelligence of the universe and shut down our intuition. It also causes our bodies break down at a more rapid pace and that accelerates the aging process.<\/p> <p>Learn to use your body-mind's innate healing power to \"digest and assimilate\" your thoughts feelings, emotions, issues and life experiences. You will begin to release the stresses that are held within the body and to heal the painful emotions associated with anxiety, depression and emotionally traumatic experiences. You will also learn to go right to the source of the issues to bring about a resolution that allows you to really move forward in your life.<br\/>Working with these practices helps to increase your intellectual and emotional range, improve memory, initiate new cycles of growth, awaken inner passions, spark creativity and deepen intuition. You will develop the strength and resilience that will make it easier for you to adapt to the demands that life places upon you.<br\/><b>Discover the passion and power that resides within you<\/b><br\/>Chinese Martial Arts Masters emphasize the development of a base of power known as the \"dan tien\". The stress of living in such a fast paced world can cause us to disconnect from our foundation. Undigested food, emotions and the stresses of daily life begin to accumulate within the abdomen. We may experience bloating and suffer from various digestive problems. Some of us begin to lose touch with our drive, passion, inspiration and the sense of knowing that reveals our true purpose as our instinctual base shuts down.<\/p> <p>You will learn to become fully present within your body, to develop greater personal power, and to awaken the inner passion and sense of knowing that will bring give you a greater sense of clarity about your life's purpose.<\/p> <p><b>Activate the healing intelligence that resides within the body and mind<\/b><br\/>We all have a powerful healing intelligence that resides within our bodies and minds. This innate healing power helps to mend our bodies any time we suffer an illness or injury. Our innate healing powers are often compromised by the stress and toxins that accumulate within our bodies.<br\/>Learn to activate the generative healing powers that reside within your own body and mind. Awaken the consciousness of the individual organs. Access and heal the emotions and core issues that are held within the body. These practices are very effective for healing digestive and respiratory disorders and a wide range of other health issues.<\/p> <p><br\/>Ben was drawn to indigenous cultures from an early age and found himself living among the Kiowa Tribe in Oklahoma at the age of seventeen.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena.

The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real.

It is upside down &amp; a short sale.<\/p> <p>OK Berry,<\/p> <p>Will be talking about marketing using signs on the Tuesday night conference call.<br\/>(I may have you on that call? Talking about your experience?)<\/p> <p>I just saw this morning that Georgia &amp; New Mexico are in the top ten states for foreclosure\/short sale?<\/p> <p>We will make some time to talk today after 6pm. About 15 minutes? It will be a conference call with all of my coaching clients invited to listen in.<\/p> <p>I will be asking a lot of questions... Be prepared with answers:<br\/>(All of the basics of any \"package\")\u00a0<\/p> <p>Do you have any training on how to do short sales? Yes? No? Who? Or what training?<br\/>(Most is garbage)<\/p> <p>I have invested about $20,000 (over 10 years) with one of the best and closed about 20 deals &amp; made over $200,000 just from short sales.

Truly a renaissance man, Lawrence is a film director, photographer, author and a deeply enlightened healer and teacher. He calls himself a \u201crubber meets the road kinda guy\u201d as he applies this practical essence to his artistic and spiritual skills over a 20 year span, to an amazing array of disciplines, starting with a couple of dream jobs \u2013 the directing of movies and as a photographer for Playboy Magazine.<br\/>Over the past several years, Lawrence has been in a process of refining his radical teachings, leading people into a new kind of freedom, literally deprogramming them from the sleep imposed by cults and religions. What is slowly evolving is a revolutionary new theory of consciousness that incorporates evolution, symbolism, metaphor, neurobiology, and their relationship to healing, spiritual evolution, and neuro-economics \u2014 the neural pathways that influences our deepest feelings about self worth and money, and, of course, sex and relationships.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawrencelanoff.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.lawrencelanoff.com\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Juicy-Enlightenment-NY\/events\/226331550\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"Fearless Relating by destroying myths *FREE* Teleconference Call","id":"226331550","time":1445972400000,"updated":1445977285000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1405281407000,"name":"Juicy Enlightenment NY","group_lon":-73.9100036621,"id":15685302,"urlname":"Juicy-Enlightenment-NY","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Juicy Explorers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Glendale","address_1":"8009 Myrtle Ave","name":"Cook's Arts & Crafts Shoppe","lon":-73.867821,"id":20715542,"lat":40.703114,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":7.18548059464,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432437124000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This meeting will be every other Tuesday evening for us to get together, practice, enjoy each others company and at some point learn new things.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226281455\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"Tuesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226281455","time":1445979600000,"updated":1445995110000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"East Meadow","address_1":"1899 Hempstead Turnpike","name":"Eisenhower Park","lon":-73.565704,"id":19377122,"state":"NY","lat":40.724289,"repinned":false},"headcount":7,"distance":22.3292160034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445463561000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bocce?

A young man named Eren and his friends Armin and Mikasa venture to the wall\u2019s edge with the hopes of seeing what\u2019s on the other side.

But the military forces Eren joins to protect humanity appear to be protecting some secrets of their own.

Everyone interacts and works together to &lt;a&gt;create a story&lt;\/a&gt; and have a few laughs as well.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Rules for Signing Up:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>How to &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;: There will be at leas two &lt;a&gt;games running&lt;\/a&gt; each week.\u00a0 You will be able to see who is running, what games are being &lt;a&gt;played&lt;\/a&gt;, and who is &lt;a&gt;playing&lt;\/a&gt; below. There will be a total of six spots &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; in each game, so if a game has filled up you will not be able to join that game.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>When you &lt;a&gt;sign up&lt;\/a&gt;, leave a comment stating which game you would like to participate in and your name will be added to the roster. If you would like to leave a game or switch over to another game in &lt;a&gt;progress&lt;\/a&gt;, simply speak to Justin or Cat. They will let you know if there is &lt;a&gt;open&lt;\/a&gt; space to do so.<\/p> <p><br\/>If it is your first time &lt;a&gt;attending&lt;\/a&gt; a game, we have pre-made characters for you to &lt;a&gt;select&lt;\/a&gt; from.

A New Architecture. A New Model.<\/p> <p>Understanding, building and maintaining a digital ecosystem requires a broader meaning of the term \u201csystem architecture.\u201d A system architecture must express more than the function of information technology (IT). It must include the architecture of our human engagement with technology and the context within which our human and technology interactions persist. As a result, a new reference model for system architecture is paramount.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nathaniel will discuss the organizational and collaborative challenges that business stakeholders, product managers, technologists, UI designers, usability engineers, user experience designers and information science professionals face to create and manage human-centered digital ecosystems. Nathaniel will propose a new model for digital experience architecture and call for digital professionals to advocate a new digital \u201csystem\u201d that thrives on the coherent and thoughtful architecture of both\u00a0<i>design<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>infrastructure<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Nathaniel Davis is the author of the upcoming book \u201cInformation Architecture: Theory, Science and Practice\u201d due in 2016.

A New Architecture. A New Model.<\/p> <p>Understanding, building and maintaining a digital ecosystem requires a broader meaning of the term \u201csystem architecture.\u201d A system architecture must express more than the function of information technology (IT). It must include the architecture of our human engagement with technology and the context within which our human and technology interactions persist. As a result, a new reference model for system architecture is paramount.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nathaniel will discuss the organizational and collaborative challenges that business stakeholders, product managers, technologists, UI designers, usability engineers, user experience designers and information science professionals face to create and manage human-centered digital ecosystems. Nathaniel will propose a new model for digital experience architecture and call for digital professionals to advocate a new digital \u201csystem\u201d that thrives on the coherent and thoughtful architecture of both\u00a0<i>design<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>infrastructure<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Nathaniel Davis is the author of the upcoming book \u201cInformation Architecture: Theory, Science and Practice\u201d due in 2016. Nathaniel is a veteran of information architecture, web strategy and design. He advises on IA and UX strategy and is founder of the DSIA Research Initiative where he curates the DSIA Portal of Information Architecture - a public knowledge base of articles and resources based on his research. Nathaniel is the information architecture columnist for UXmatters and a contributing guest writer for the Bulletin of The Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T). In addition to curating the DSIA Research Initiative, Nathaniel Davis serves as director of information architecture for a Fortune 100 company.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/3\/4\/600_442089012.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Noreen Whysel\u00a0<\/p> <p>IA Gateway<\/p> <p>The\u00a0Information Architecture Gateway\u00a0is conceived as a portal that helps\u00a0IA practitioners, libraries, associations, universities, researchers, and other groups and individuals from various sectors\u00a0to connect to, search, find, and use tools.

A person from the female team will bowl a frame. Next, a member of the male team will bowl a frame. Then female number two bowls a frame followed by male number two. The process continues until all ten frames are bowled. During this time all of the members of the group will be getting to know each other. Which ever group has the highest score at the end of each game will win a prize.<\/p> <p>At the end of the game, the ladies will stay at the same lane.

Once in a while I wake up, and\u00a0sometimes I even program something. And once I'm tired of that, I go\u00a0back to sleep, regardless of whether the programming is finished.\u00a0This work schedule lends itself to a style of programming that efficiently\u00a0produces robust, simple, user-friendly data analysis software.<\/p> <p>I'll introduce the main principles behind my approach to writing data\u00a0analysis software. Next, I'll present some common problems that my\u00a0programming style completely avoids. Finally, I'll discuss how my\u00a0programming style is well suited for certain projects and horribly\u00a0inappropriate for others.<\/p> <p><br\/>Some main ideas include:<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I store the most raw form of data that I can, and then I think of my entire program as pure functions. To make it easy to store raw forms of data, I wrote vlermv, a library that maps Python dictionaries to files.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Systems should be so simple and legible that I can figure out how they worked after I have lost the source code and the documentation and only have the data.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0I have a particular way of drawing flow charts.

Stetzer, Jr.<\/p> <p>Paul has ended one career and begun another.\u00a0 His first profession was education, beginning in Head Start in 1968. He then became an environmental educator at an urban nature center and concluded as an elementary science teacher in a Quaker school. After spending all his life in Philadelphia teaching and raising two daughters, he married his childhood sweetheart and moved to New York in 1997 where he helped to raise two stepdaughters. Time passes as it is wont to do, and currently he has the great joy of being companion to two grandchildren. Now, Paul practices photography: landscape, portrait, and documentary.

It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

Renowned and respected for the ancestral wisdom she carries, Do\u00f1a openly shares ancient rituals, healing practices and Sacred Prayers from her community in the Mexican forests. In this workshop, she will guide us thru powerful rituals and techniques to deepen our awareness of the Healing Spirits in nature and further awaken our abilities to heal, purify, protect and Bless ourselves and our loved ones.

We lead an open kirtan practice (Music and Mantra Meditation\/Celebration) every Sunday afternoon at our home in Brooklyn, where we sing sacred sounds and share stories and poems from the ancient mystics. \"Bhakti\" is the sanskrit word for devotion, surrender and divine love. \"Dojo\" is a place for practice and discipline. Bhakti Dojo's mission is to spread the joys and blessings of sacred sound vibration by cultivating a community that supports the transformation that accompanies regular practice. We are storytellers and musicians, dancers and poets, teachers and servants, and we offer all this service in love. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/bhaktidojo\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/bhaktidojo\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Sarah Eve is a culinary shaman, making magic in the kitchen and healing from the heart.
