Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p><b>***If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.***<\/b><\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>CHELSEA PARK.<\/p> <p>Between 27th and 28th street\u00a0and 10th Avenue.<\/p> <p>Take A,\u00a0C or E to 23rd St and 8th Ave and walk to\u00a010th Ave and 27th St or any\u00a0subway line to 34th St and Penn Station and walk for about 8 minutes to 28th St and 10th Ave.<\/p> <p><b>What to bring with you:<\/b><\/p> <p>A pair of sneakers, indoor or turf shoes, shin guards (recommended) and lots of water.

In exploring Cooper Hewitt\u2019s collection, he has created a dialogue between the museum\u2019s textiles and his own \u201clibrary of patterns\u201d that he draws on as a source of inspiration in his work.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again.

Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.<\/p> <p>You will get a match card and at the end of each mini date you'll discreetly indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host.

PQA is genre-independent and supports under-represented music in the string quartet repertoire regardless of style; including jazz, world, improvised, non-notated, and electronic music. Each PQA cycle culminates in a high profile showcase concert in New York City featuring the chosen compositions. The 2015 showcase concert will be at the DiMenna Center on September 26th. Each concert features an open discussion between the audience and distinguished composers, performers, and academics. This year we are honored to have the magical Marcos Balter and rad Du Yun on the discussion panel!<\/p> <p>The goal of PUBLIQ Access is to bring exposure of the chosen pieces to the widest possible reach through performances of the highest quality and audience engagement through talks, panels, and free concerts. Every PQ concert features work from their PUBLIQ Access program including all performances on tour.<\/p> <p>This is a great opportunity to work closely with a professional string quartet with extensive new music, improvisation, and composition experience. Composers can submit a pre-existing string quartet (written within the last 2 years) or write a piece specifically for this submission. The number of pieces selected will be determined by the length of the final performance (approximately 60 minutes). All PUBLIQ Access concerts are free and open to the public.

PQA is genre-independent and supports under-represented music in the string quartet repertoire regardless of style; including jazz, world, improvised, non-notated, and electronic music. Each PQA cycle culminates in a high profile showcase concert in New York City featuring the chosen compositions. The 2015 showcase concert will be at the DiMenna Center on September 26th. Each concert features an open discussion between the audience and distinguished composers, performers, and academics. This year we are honored to have the magical <b>Marcos Balter<\/b> and rad <b>Du Yun<\/b> on the discussion panel!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of PUBLIQ Access is to bring exposure of the chosen pieces to the widest possible reach through performances of the highest quality and audience engagement through talks, panels, and free concerts. Every PQ concert features work from their PUBLIQ Access program including all performances on tour.<\/p> <p>This is a great opportunity to work closely with a professional string quartet with extensive new music, improvisation, and composition experience. Composers can submit a pre-existing string quartet (written within the last 2 years) or write a piece specifically for this submission. The number of pieces selected will be determined by the length of the final performance (approximately 60 minutes). All PUBLIQ Access concerts are free and open to the public.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone.

This event has been specially designed to help you Restore, Renew, and bring Harmony to your heart and your body. The intention is to bring you to a greater place of feeling more embodied, balanced, grounded and connected to yourself and others in a deliciously fun and blissful way.<\/p> <p><b>Transformational Dance w\/Trinity <\/b><\/p> <p>Trinity will guide you through a fun, transformational and improvisational dance experience. This lightly facilitated dance will take you into higher states of love, connection and playfulness. Dancers will be inspired by passionate music and powerful, creative, lightly guided, improvisational dance rituals. These dance rituals will empower you to expand your creativity and release your inhibitions- supporting you to dance wild, free and playful like a child. They will clear your energy and bring an experience of renewal to you and your connection with others. No dance experience is necessary.<\/p> <p>Many participants, who have shared that they are normally intimidated by dance, shared how they were able to really let go and felt so much more uninhibited during Trinity\u2019s transformational dance experiences.<\/p> <p><b>Healing Touch (aka Reiki) w\/Trinity<\/b><\/p> <p>We will end with the evening with soft nurturing heart touch (aka reiki). This will ground everything we have experienced together. Trinity will teach simple Reiki to everyone and don\u2019t worry there is no experience necessary. Reiki is a gentle hands-on-healing method that originated in Japan. During a Reiki session the practitioner lightly places their hands in a series of non-intrusive positions on or near the body. There is no massage or manipulation. The recipient remains fully clothed while the practitioner channels universal energy through the palms of their hands onto the receiver. This exchange of energy often causes the receiver to feel relaxed, blissful and centered.<\/p> <p>Come dance, connect and be blissed with us!<\/p> <p>No experience with dance or reiki is necessary!<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Advance Registration is recommended!<\/b><\/p> <p>$20 early bird (by Saturday, Sept 19th)<\/p> <p>$25 advance (register by 11:30pm the night before event)<\/p> <p>$30 day of (cash at door)<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Register at-<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/transformational-dance.eventbrite.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/transformational-dance.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/transformational-dance.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Testimonials from Trinity\u2019s Events-<\/b><\/p> <p>\u201cTrinity leads this outrageously fun facilitated dance celebration with all of her heart, passion, power, and love.

We have a great showcase, anniversary cake, and a special presentation for the night.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Performances by:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Piel Canela Dance Company<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Alma de Piel Canela\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Zafire Dance Company<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0LFX Dancers<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Pura Vida Dance Company<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Rhtyhmology<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Nieves Latin Dance Studio<\/p> <p>\u2022 Tiffany Benson's <i>Allure Dance Company<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Myrna Caceres with Yvonne Marshall<\/p> <p>and more to be announced!<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pielcaneladancers.com\">Website<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1075485339170244\/\">Facebook invite<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SalsaNY\/events\/225594739\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":14400000,"name":"Piel Canela Dance Company 15th Year Anniversary","id":"225594739","time":1443315600000,"updated":1443330997000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1395537407000,"name":"SALSA NEW YORK Classes, Workshops, Parties & Special Offers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":13494372,"urlname":"SalsaNY","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Salseros"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"108 West 40th street","name":"Croton Lounge","lon":-73.985797,"id":1241458,"state":"NY","lat":40.75385,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.345750182867,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442850404000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Please note: This is NOT an ATWYS event, this is a \"partner\" event we are promoting for another singles company.<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0 <b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u00a0$15 IN ADVANCE\/$20 AT THE DOOR<\/b><\/p> <p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/atwysnutsbolts.eventbrite.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/atwysnutsbolts.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/atwysnutsbolts.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p>It's time again for one of our most popular Meetups!\u00a0As seen on ABC News, a Nuts &amp; Bolts party is a unique, slightly sexy\u00a0&amp; great way to meet upscale, outgoing\u00a0&amp; attractive singles!<\/p> <p>Don't miss this Meetup and\u00a0screw\u00a0yourself out of the chance to find your right\u00a0fit...You'd be\u00a0nuts\u00a0not to attend.

Having the only figure-eight configuration on the calendar, the Suzuka circuit with its 18 diverse corners and 5.807 km in length has hosted some memorable races since its inaugural year in 1987.<\/p> <p><b>STANDINGS:<\/b> After an unfortunate weekend in Singapore, Lewis Hamilton now leads the Drivers' Championship by 41 points over his teammate Nico Rosberg. The current standings are: Hamilton in 1st with 252 points, Rosberg in 2nd with 211 points and Sebastian Vettel in close 3rd with 203 points. In the Constructor standings, Mercedes continues to dominate with 463 points, Ferrari sits in 2nd with 310 points and Williams in 3rd with 198 points.<\/p> <p><b>TIRE ALLOCATION:<\/b>\u00a0Pirelli says, \"Suzuka is one of the most demanding tracks of the year in terms of lateral energy. For this reason, the two hardest compounds in the range have been selected: P Zero Orange hard and P Zero White medium, to cope with the high speeds, high abrasion and fast corners.\"<\/p> <p><b>DRS ZONES:<\/b> One - pit straight<\/p> <p>So can Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes return to their winning ways in Japan?\u00a0Or can Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari pull off another impressive win and close the gap even more? If you're in the New York City area and looking for some great racing action with other F1 fans, be sure to join us for the Japanese Grand Prix to see who will take the checkered flag.\u00a0Race will start at\u00a0<b>1:00AM EDT<\/b>\u00a0with the pre-race starting at\u00a0<b>12:30AM EDT<\/b>.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/225470550\/","yes_rsvp_count":18,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytmbkc","time":1443358800000,"updated":1443390870000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":0,"distance":5.09583377838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1370538278000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pickupsoccer-202\/events\/225346009\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"GAME","id":"dnkzcgytmbkc","time":1443358800000,"updated":1443371722000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1214915969000,"name":"Bay Ridge FC Get back in shape pickup soccer","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1206990,"urlname":"pickupsoccer-202","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Northeast Corner of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue","name":"Outside 7 train Main Street Station","lon":-73.830147,"id":22496472,"state":"NY","lat":40.759571,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.40977954865,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1439510401000,"fee":{"amount":3,"accepts":"cash","description":"per non-member","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Distance:\u00a015 miles\u00a0Walk the Queens waterfront from Flushing to Bayside.

Plan to arrive by 9:45 AM. We will hike the Millstone Trail\/Matapan Rock Trail. This loop hike passes interesting and historic millstones, goes by two scenic lakes and climbs to a panoramic viewpoint. 5.5 miles at a moderate pace. Please watch this site on the morning of September 27 for any last minute changes\/cancellations. Hiking boots required. Bring water and a snack.<br\/>DIRECTIONS:<br\/>RAMAPO MOUNTAIN STATE FOREST, Oakland, NJ<br\/>I-287 North to Exit 57 (Skyline Drive). Turn left at light onto Skyline Drive.<br\/>Upper Lot: Coordinates: N41\u00b0 02.85', W74\u00b0 15.09' go an additional 1.14 miles on Skyline Drive to lot at top of hill on left.<br\/>ALTERNATIVE: Follow Weis Ecology Center directions, but stay on Ringwood Ave., CR 511 past Westbrook Rd. Turn right onto Skyline Drive. The parking areas will be on the right at the top of the hill.<\/p> <p>The address to key into GPS for Sunday's hike is 265 Skyline Drive in Oakland NJ. It is the second parking area on the left as you head north on Skyline Dr from 287. The parking is tight and you may need to park along Skyline Drive. You may want to carpool if you can. I am coming from Chatham if anyone wants to ride up with me. I did the hike last Sunday and it is 5.5 miles and should take about 2 1\/2 hours depending on our rest breaks, It is not terribly strenuous compared to other hikes I have been on but there are several ups and downs so it will be a good workout. There is also a steep decline near the end that can be avoided by walking the last quarter mile down Skyline Drive. The pace will be moderate so everyone can keep up.See you on Sunday.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Tri-State-Ramblers-formerly-Union-County-Hiking-Club\/events\/224688740\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"HIKE- Ramapo Mountain State Forest, Oakland","id":"224688740","time":1443362400000,"updated":1443408775000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1393431491000,"name":"TriState Ramblers","group_lon":-74.4899978638,"id":13087292,"urlname":"Tri-State-Ramblers-formerly-Union-County-Hiking-Club","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":0,"distance":1.38483917713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428838074000,"fee":{"amount":100,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This Meetup is announced for 10am, but you can also come at 2pm.<\/b><\/p> <p>Come riding on the beautiful trail system that spans Old Westbury-Brookville-Muttontown.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

It's time for some ladies. And as we just finished one version of a murder novel, let's try another in a different flavor.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Many members have mentioned Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize winning novel <i>The Goldfinch <\/i>as something they'd like to read. However,<i>The Goldfinch<\/i>\u00a0is a hefty 740 pages. Of Tartt's three published novels, her first, <i>The Secret History<\/i>, is the shortest, weighing in at a mere 570. It is also one of her most controversial, with critics sharply divided in their reviews. Tartt began <i>The Secret History<\/i> when she was still at college and was bought by $450,000 by Knopf after a bidding war. A 75,000 print order was made for the first edition (as opposed to the usual 10,000 order for a debut novel), and the book became a bestseller.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Set in New England, <i>The Secret History<\/i> tells the story of a closely knit group of six classics students at a small, elite Vermont college, Hampden College, similar in many respects to Bennington College (in Bennington, Vermont) where Tartt was a student from 1982 to 1986.<\/p> <p>Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality their lives are changed profoundly and forever, and they discover how hard it can be to truly live and how easy it is to kill.\u00a0<i>The Secret History<\/i>\u00a0is a study of ruin, of lives blighted forever by adolescent hubris.<\/p> <p><br\/>The story is an inverted detective story, not a Whodunit but a Whydunit. The novel is a page-turner, but there is more to <i>The Secret History<\/i> than plot alone. The novel is written in a florid, Neo-Romanticist prose style, in keeping with its romanticist themes of aesthetic beauty and its tendency to draw connections to Edwardian and Victorian literary references as well as classical civilizations. It has been referred to as \"quality trash for highbrows.\" That sounds absolutely delightful to me.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll meet in the northwest corner of the Sheep Meadow, by 67th Street and West Drive, near the big tree halfway between Mineral Springs and Tavern on the Green.

Today, more people in developing countries have access to a mobile phone than to electricity or clean water. The various benefits of the digital revolution are undeniable\u2014easier communication, greater access to information, and new forms of leisure, to name a few. In the developing world the focus is gradually shifting to generating the broader benefits typically associated with technology\u2014higher economic growth, more jobs and better public services.<\/p> <p>A discussion on how to make digital technologies a more effective force for development is timely, in light of the UN Summit on Post-2015 Development Agenda and after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). It is also useful to consider whether and how digital technologies can accelerate the process of attaining these goals. The forthcoming World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends, to be launched in January 2016, provides many useful facts and analysis to anchor this discussion.<\/p> <p>In this context, the Government of the Republic of Estonia, the Government of the United States, and the World Bank will co-host a High-Level Side Event, Development in the Digital Age, on September 27, 2015.<\/p> <p>The discussion will focus on two policy areas that improve the impact of digital technologies on development. First, to promote policy and regulatory environments that will make the Internet more accessible, affordable, open and safe. Second, how to make digital technologies a more effective force for development and whether and how digital technologies can accelerate the process of attaining these goals.<\/p> <p>Ninety percent of people without access to the Internet live in the developing world. Bridging the digital divide between and within countries\u2014across borders, gender, income and age\u2014is essential in the emerging digital economy. Along with better connectivity, the Digital Revolution has opened up new possibilities for disadvantaged and excluded groups. However, these technologies have also brought\u00a0 new set of challenges, such as cybersecurity,\u00a0 maintaining an open Internet, and protecting users\u2019 privacy. The panel discussion will address various private sector initiatives as well as government actions. For example the U.S. State Department\u2019s soon to be launched new diplomatic initiative, to help catalyse public-private partnerships to close the global digital divide. It will also explore the policy priorities for the global community to create an open and trusted environment in the digital world.<\/p> <p>Over the last decade, digital technologies have been a source of significant economic growth and net job creation, as well as an important force for transparency and accountability around the world. Although significant progress has been made with respect to expanding access and in turn benefits, additional efforts on the part of all stakeholders are needed to connect the unconnected. The panel discussion will explore the policy options to amplify the development impact of digital technologies. In doing so, it will survey the experience of countries with strong track records on digital development such as Estonia, or aspiring such as Rwanda or Tanzania and draw policy lessons for other.<\/p> <p><br\/>The format will be a panel discussion. Following the introduction by the Moderator, each Speaker will make an introductory statement followed by a moderated discussion, in which the Speakers would also answer the questions<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Digital-Diplomacy-New-York\/events\/225509617\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Development in the Digital Age","id":"225509617","time":1443366000000,"updated":1443378819000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1344358729000,"name":"Digital Diplomacy New York Meetup","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":4490972,"urlname":"Digital-Diplomacy-New-York","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Digital Diplomats"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10018","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"200 W. 40th Street","name":"Midtown Comics","lon":-73.988274,"id":1543300,"state":"NY","lat":40.754925,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.352697372437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442688515000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everypony!

Can we count on you?<\/p> <p>Our booth will be on the South Side of Atlantic Avenue (you'll be out of direct sun), between Henry and Hicks Streets, closer to Henry. Its \"Space Number\" is AS32, which will be near 108 Atlantic Avenue. The closest subway station is Borough Hall, of the 2,3, 4, and R lines. FWIW, our booth's GPS coordinates are:<\/p> <p>Latitude and Longitude (Decimal)<br\/>Latitude:[masked]<br\/>Longitude: [masked]<\/p> <p><br\/>Latitude and Longitude (ddd.mm.ss)<br\/>Latitude: N 40\u00b0 41\u2032 26.4\u2033<br\/>Longitude: W 73\u00b0 59\u2032 47.68\u2033<\/p> <p>Atlantic Antic officially starts at 12:00 PM and ends at 6:00 PM, though we will start closing around 5:30 PM. If you can come help us set up at around 10:15 AM, that would be swell. You don't have to stay for the entire fair. Stay as long or as short as you like. But whichever, you will have a blast. I guarantee it.<\/p> <p>Questions, comments?<\/p> <p>Be there or be rhomboid!<\/p> <p>Thanks for reading.<\/p> <p>Alton<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-Libertarians\/events\/225504438\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":21600000,"name":"Join us at Atlantic Antic, Sunday, Sept 27","id":"225504438","time":1443369600000,"updated":1443392285000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1168377517000,"name":"The New York Libertarian Party Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":399919,"urlname":"NY-Libertarians","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Libertarians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"73 Eighth Avenue (Between 13th and 14th Streets)","name":"Think Coffee","lon":-73.982567,"id":15199002,"state":"NY","lat":40.731339,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":0,"distance":1.34967446327,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442782413000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"par personne","currency":"USD","label":"Tarifs","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE<\/p> <p>collective conversation: $10\/person -- Sunday 12-1pm -- (RSVP required)\u00a0<\/p> <p>A bient\u00f4t!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Rafa\u00ebl Leloup.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2014\u00a0seats are limited, please do not sign up if you can't come\u00a0\u2014<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FrenchConversationGroup\/events\/225495017\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"French Conversation (INTERMEDIATE) - $10\/p","id":"225495017","time":1443369600000,"updated":1443376177000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1374351381000,"name":"French Conversation Group","group_lon":-74,"id":9441202,"urlname":"FrenchConversationGroup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Francophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":8,"distance":19.0303649902,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442369923000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Photographer &amp; Model Photoshoot Society Presents:<\/p> <p><b>\"Pre-Halloween Glamour Shoot #2 w\/Neesy &amp; Nani - Sept. 27th\"<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We're back this month with the second of our pre-halloween glamour shoots.

If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>NEW Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p>Check-in\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at [masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/225386089\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"Pre-Halloween Glamour Shoot #2 w\/Neesy & Nani - Sept. 27th","id":"225386089","time":1443369600000,"updated":1443398943000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"1763 2nd Ave","name":"Annie's & Co","lon":-73.9496,"id":24075121,"state":"NY","lat":40.781742,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.05236458778,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441501654000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The 2015 NYC Yarn Crawl will be held Friday, September 25 thru Sunday September 27.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p><br\/>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play anywhere in NYC, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p><a

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/224990814\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflytmbkc","time":1443369600000,"updated":1443383677000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":14.8351278305,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441138898000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Please contact me ASAP, if you'd like to\u00a0carpool\u00a0to\u00a0split the $8 parking fee per vehicle.

You can spend all day inside of the museum.<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CPbldiLUwAEUMi7.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Reminder: Do not eat or drink on the bus!<\/p> <p>Also note that the museum is a underground train station, there is NO CELL PHONE SIGNAL once you've entered the museum!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/b\/6\/600_434997270.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/c\/7\/600_434997287.jpeghttp:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/b\/c\/600_434997276.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/f\/d\/6\/600_434997302.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/0\/b\/600_434472555.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>RULES:<\/b><\/p> <p>1. Food is not allowed in the museum except in the cafeteria. If you need to eat, make sure it's ONLY in the cafeteria! They are very strict about cleanliness in the museum! If you bring in like bottle of water or bag of chips, put it in your backpack until you get in the cafeteria. If you walk in with open bag of chips, or sandwich, or unfinished soda can, or a cup of coffee is unacceptable! If you have food on you which already eating, make sure to finish it before heading inside.<\/p> <p>2. <b>DO NOT<\/b> mess around with the old trains! Such as scratching them, vandalizing or picking up the wicker seats!(Someone did that the last time and I wasn't happy about it!) You'll get in deep trouble for doing that! Some of the trains are 80 to over 100 years old. Please show some respect to them! If you don't respect the Museum trains, and the rules here, then I'll have to ask you to leave(I'm not joking. Rules are very strict in the museum). In this meetup is all about having fun and hanging out with your friends, not causing a raucous.<\/p> <p>3. Filming and taking pictures is allowed.<\/p> <p>4. No climbing on display objects!<\/p> <p>5. Don't Litter.<\/p> <p>6. It's the weekend, there will be a lot of children in the museum. So be careful!<\/p> <p>7. <b>NO! DO NOT GO ON TO THE TRACKS!<\/b> They're electrified to keep the lights on the trains going.<\/p> <p><b>Note: You must RSVP before you show up and also part of the group!

Manhattan. Sunday, September 27th @ 1:00PM<\/p> <p>Gotham Yacht Club is looking for fun sailors and non-sailors to join us this weekend for the first trip of fall and likely the last trip of the season!<\/p> <p>We take trips around the Manhattan area in a 50-foot Beneteau. We usually sail the Hudson--the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge--but also go to Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.<\/p> <p>We like to fill the boat up with about 20-30 people. No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>. Please include your current email address so that we can contact you directly.\u00a0 Since boat trips fill up in advance and we receive many applicants, we may not get back to you immediately. \u00a0<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on the water!<\/p> <p>EVERY APPLICANT (REVELERS, SUNBATHERS, ETC.)<\/p> <p>Q) Please provide a link to your page on Facebook or other social networking site. Please attach a picture if you don\u2019t have a page on a social networking site.<\/p> <p>Q) How old are you?<\/p> <p>Q) Where did you attend school?<\/p> <p>Q) Will you please tell us a little bit about yourself?<\/p> <p>FOR SAILOR APPLICANTS<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you crewed on, but not captained, a sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you captained a sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you crewed on but not captained, a non-sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) How many days, lifetime, have you captained, a non-sailboat?<\/p> <p>Q) Will you tell us a little bit about your sailing experience?<\/p> <p><br\/>Please copy and paste all questions and answers and send in an email to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Thank you!<\/p> <p><br\/>FAQ<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do you have to pay to attend a boat party?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: No, all boat parties are absolutely free.\u00a0 You may want to bring food and drinks, which are on a potluck basis.<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: The specific location is not listed.\u00a0 Where do we meet for the boat party?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Unfortunately, we cannot fit everyone who RSVPs to a MeetUp event onto the boat.\u00a0 There are some crew members and attendees who are not part of the MeetUp group, so there may be less space than it appears.\u00a0 In order to avoid miscommunication and needing to leave people on the dock, specific details (including meeting location) are sent to members individually. \u00a0Our club's assistant generally does not work after business hours on Friday, so if you have not have received an individual email by then, it's unlikely that you will be able to attend that week\u2019s boat party.<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: How often are the boat parties?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Boat parties are generally every weekend, either on a Saturday or Sunday. They generally last all afternoon into the early evening.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Q: Do I have to fill out the questionnaire?<\/p> <p><br\/>A: Yes! Please fill out the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible.\u00a0 If you are uncomfortable posting any of the information on your profile, please email your responses to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.\u00a0 Without a complete application, you will not be considered to receive an invitation.\u00a0 The trips last several hours, so we will have 20-30 people in a confined space for an extended period of time. Therefore, we need to have an idea of who we are inviting on the boat and ensure that we have a proper crew.\u00a0 Please fill out the questionnaire if you are interested in sailing with Gotham Yacht Club.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail\/events\/225561788\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Sunday Autumn Sailing, Season Finale","id":"225561788","time":1443373200000,"updated":1443386900000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1434554860000,"name":"Gotham Yacht Club: Social Sail","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18679654,"urlname":"Gotham-Yacht-Club-Social-Sail","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Sailors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"229 Knickerbocker Street","name":"City Fresh Market\/Maria Hernandez Park","lon":-73.92541,"id":24108754,"state":"NY","lat":40.7029,"repinned":true},"headcount":0,"distance":4.69183254242,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442964144000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bernie was in town last week and he's getting more popular by the day.

Mars is a colonial world, governed by corporate interests on Earth. The citizens of Mars are hardworking, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of the Earthly powers to keep the best new inventions for themselves. The young Martians -- the second and third generations born on Mars -- have little loyalty to Earth, and a strong belief that their planet can be independent. The revolution begins slowly, but will grow in power over decades of political struggle until it becomes irresistible.<\/p> <p>Told through the eyes of an extraordinary character, Casseia Majumdar, a daughter of one of Mars' oldest, most conservative Binding Multiples, Moving Mars is Greg Bear's brilliant conception of the human colonization of the red planet, with lovingly painted details and a grand historical sweep, embellishing an audacious scientific speculation.\"<\/p> <p>LOCATION<br\/>We will be meeting at the Citigroup Atrium.<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/1\/600_42060561.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There is an entrance at 53rd and Lexington Avenue off of the 53rd and Lex subway stop.

His death leaves his silent benefactor, a young djinn prince, torn between loyalty to his family and loyalty to a faith which calls out for justice \u2013 even at the point of a sword.<\/p> <p>Inspired by the myths of the Arabic and Persian speaking world, as much as the headlines currently roiling it, Daevabad is an epic fantasy that shows often not even magic can soften the iron grip of history and politics.<\/p> <p>Shan prepared some questions as a guide, but would also appreciate any notes in the text itself.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers\/events\/223225656\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Daevabad Beta Reading Meeting","id":"223225656","time":1443376800000,"updated":1443403129000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1278875895000,"name":"Brooklyn Speculative Fiction Writers","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1673851,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Speculative-Fiction-Writers","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"writers of speculative fiction"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":25,"headcount":0,"distance":7.63257312775,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421115530000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join me for this 1 hour guided meditation where I utilize breathwork, imagery and brief Therapeutic Touch healing treatments to induce deep relaxation and to offer attendees relief from aches, pain and stress.<\/p> <p>This Healing Group brings the benefits of guided meditation and Therapeutic Touch to Forest Hills.

When someone\u2019s heart weighed less than Ma\u2019at\u2019s feather, it was an indication that the individual had lived a righteous life. Hence, we must learn to be light-hearted and not take anything to heart, as the expression goes.<\/p> <p>Ma\u2019at\u2019s ruling planet is Jupiter, symbolizing expansiveness, wealth, and abundance. Her power gave the universe the very foundations of law and order on which it operates today. Maat is the supreme deity of relationships and love. She teaches us to love and seek nothing in return. Ma\u2019at tells us that everything in life has a form-and-function relationship, and therefore, we are all connected.<\/p> <p>Much has been written and discussed about Ma\u2019at. But little has been disclosed about how her ancient power can help you in your life today. When you join Master <i>Qesankh Maa Kheperu<\/i> for this extraordinary ritual, he will reveal not only how to work and communicate with the deity, but also the specific techniques for bringing your desires to fruition. Pick one area where you are in need, and come to the ritual ready to get the need fulfilled. <b>Everyone attending will receive an amazing free gift that has been magically charged by Master <i>Qesankh Maa Kheperu<\/i>. <\/b><\/p> <p>Ritual Agenda<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Opening to the Deity Sebek<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Talk on the principles of Ma\u2019at<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Offering to Ma\u2019at<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Oracle objective reading<\/p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Meditation to Maat<\/p> <p>\u00b7 \u00a0Performing invocation<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00b7\u00a0 Closing ceremony<\/p> <p><b>Donations are welcomed, but not required.<\/b> Please try to wear Ma\u2019at\u2019s color, which is blue.

I'll be eagerly anticipating an awesome conversation!<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there,<\/p> <p>Christina ***Book Synopsis ***<br\/>Darlene, once an exemplary wife and a loving mother to her young son, Eddie, finds herself devastated by the unforeseen death of her husband. Unable to cope with her grief, she turns to drugs, and quickly forms an addiction. One day she disappears without a trace.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Unbeknownst to eleven-year-old Eddie, now left behind in a panic-stricken search for her, Darlene has been lured away with false promises of a good job and a rosy life. A shady company named Delicious Foods shuttles her to a remote farm, where she is held captive, performing hard labor in the fields to pay off the supposed debt for her food, lodging, and the constant stream of drugs the farm provides to her and the other unfortunates imprisoned there.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In\u00a0Delicious Foods, James Hannaham tells the gripping story of three unforgettable characters: a mother, her son, and the drug that threatens to destroy them. Through Darlene's haunted struggle to reunite with Eddie, through the efforts of both to triumph over those who would enslave them, and through the irreverent and mischievous voice of the drug that narrates Darlene's travails, Hannaham's daring and shape-shifting prose infuses this harrowing experience with grace and humor.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The desperate circumstances that test the unshakeable bond between this mother and son unfold into myth, and Hannaham's treatment of their ordeal spills over with compassion. Along the way we experience a tale at once contemporary and historical that wrestles with timeless questions of love and freedom, forgiveness and redemption, tenacity and the will to survive.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club\/events\/222513053\/","yes_rsvp_count":15,"duration":10800000,"name":"\"Delicious Foods\" by James Hannaham *Special Author Appearance","id":"222513053","time":1443376800000,"updated":1443629598000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1228498177000,"name":"Uptown Girl's Harlem Book Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1333170,"urlname":"Uptown-Girls-Harlem-Book-Club","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Uptown Ladies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11361","country":"us","city":"Bayside","address_1":"215-01 33rd rd","name":"crocheron park","lon":-73.776039,"id":14625132,"state":"NY","lat":40.770672,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":11.31138134,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430525068000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join the conversation about this upcoming meetup.\u00a0 Suggest and post songs you'd like to play with the group so we all have words and chords\u00a0 to play from(some people even practice them)<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Click on Pages above for all you need to know and Photos for a map","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Queens-ParkJams\/events\/225372154\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Let's get together and play","id":"gxdvglytmbkc","time":1443376800000,"updated":1443396253000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430523367000,"name":"Queens Jamming in the Park","group_lon":-73.7799987793,"id":18572510,"urlname":"Queens-ParkJams","group_lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Queens Jammers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"241 W 30th Street (West of 7th Ave)","address_2":"2nd Floor, Press 102","lon":-74.19864,"phone":"212-691-7690","name":"Edgar Cayce's A.R.E. of New York","id":5228282,"state":"NY","lat":40.73128,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.0211772919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1418189257000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Using concepts from the Cayce readings, participants share dream material in a supportive group format, encouraging self-examination and interpretation of dreams and dream symbolism as a way of emotional and spiritual growth.<\/p> <p><br\/>Facilitator: Paul Dorogoff<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.edgarcaycenyc.org\/images\/groups\/dreamsstudygroup.jpg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Edgar-Cayces-A-R-E-of-New-Official-Meetup-Group\/events\/225517925\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Dream Study Group","id":"lxlbdlytmbkc","time":1443378600000,"updated":1443389174000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1326847896000,"name":"Edgar Cayce's A.R.E. of New York -- Official Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3122892,"urlname":"Edgar-Cayces-A-R-E-of-New-Official-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.868552923203,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441992166000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Our colleagues at <b>St. Francis Xavier Gay Catholics Group<\/b> made us aware of this upcoming talk by <b>Sister Jeannine Gramick<\/b> - The Co-Founder of New Ways Ministries (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newwaysministry.org\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newwaysministry.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.newwaysministry.org\/<\/a><\/a>) this coming Sunday - September 23.\u00a0 Short Reception to follow the talk.<\/p> <p>All are welcome and this is a Free-Will Contribution Event. For more specific information on the event, you can also contact &lt;a&gt;[masked] Background&lt;\/a&gt; information on Sister Jeannine Gramick from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newwaysministry.org\">www.newwaysministry.org<\/a> site is below:<\/p> <p>Sr. Jeannine Gramick, SL<\/p> <p>Jeannine Gramick, a Roman Catholic nun, was born in 1942 and educated in Catholic grade and high schools in Philadelphia. She moved to Baltimore in 1960 to join the School Sisters of Notre Dame.\u00a0 She taught mathematics in high school in the 1960\u2019s and was an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in the early 1970\u2019s.<\/p> <p>While engaged in study for her doctoral degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Sister Gramick became friends with a gay man and began a church ministry to lesbian and gay people. She organized religious services for people with a homosexual identity who had left the Catholic Church because of prejudice against them. Gradually the people she met came to understand that God loves all persons, regardless of one\u2019s sexual orientation, and that the Catholic Church began to welcome them with compassion and love. She has conducted spiritual retreats and pilgrimages to holy places and shrines for lesbian and gay people, their parents, families, and friends.<\/p> <p>Sister Gramick helped to begin three organizations for Catholic lesbian and gay people. In addition, she co-founded New Ways Ministry, a Catholic social justice center working for the reconciliation of lesbian\/gay people and the church.<\/p> <p>Sister Gramick has traveled throughout the English-speaking world to address groups about sexual identity. She advances the judgment of the American Psychiatric Association that a homosexual identity is not a sickness but an alternative sexual orientation. Consequently, she promotes dialogue, discussion, and education to eradicate myths and stereotypes about lesbian and gay people. She advocates the acceptance of gay and lesbian people as full and equal members of religious, civil, and social groups. She believes that only if all people are treated with dignity and respect will there be peace and harmony in the world.<\/p> <p>Sister Gramick has written and edited numerous articles and books. Her books include Homosexuality and the Catholic Church, Homosexuality in the Priesthood and Religious Life, The Vatican and Homosexuality, Building Bridges: Gay and Lesbian Reality and the Catholic Church, and Voices of Hope: A Collection of Positive Catholic Writings on Lesbian\/Gay Issues. Building Bridges was translated into Italian and published as Anime Gay: Gli omosessuali e la Chiesa cattolica.<\/p> <p>For more than 30 years, Sister Gramick has worked for justice and peace for sexual minorities. For approximately 20 years, her religious community, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, assigned her to this church ministry. Because of opposition to her work and consequent political considerations in her church, in 2001 she transferred to the Sisters of Loretto, another community of Catholic nuns. The Sisters of Loretto support her in her ministry of education and advocacy on behalf of lesbian and gay people.<\/p> <p>Sister Gramick is the subject of a documentary film, entitled <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ingoodconscience.com\/site\/index.php\">In Good Conscience: Sister Jeannine Gramick's Journey of Faith<\/a>, by the Peabody and Emmy award-winning director, Barbara Rick.<\/p> <p>Many groups have recognized her work in this pioneer ministry. Some of these groups include the National Coalition of American Nuns, the Loretto Community, the Paulist Community, Call to Action; Dignity USA, the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary\u2019s College, Pridefest America, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, and the American Psychological Association. She received the 2005 Peace Prize from the Santa Claus Foundation in Turkey for her work with sexual minorities. She was named a 2006 Laureate of the International Mother Teresa Awards for her role as a human rights activist.<\/p> <p>Sister Gramick holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics Education from the University of Pennsylvania and an M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Notre Dame. She served on the national boards of the National Assembly of Women Religious, the Religious Network of Equality for Women, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Women's Ordination Conference. She is currently an Executive Co-Director of the National Coalition of American Nuns. She is strongly committed to justice and peace for humanity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>You can contact Sr. Gramick at gramick(at)juno(dot)com.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GayCatholics\/events\/225286461\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":7200000,"name":"TALK: \"Church & LGBTQ Catholic Community\" by Sister Jeannine Gramick","id":"225286461","time":1443378600000,"updated":1443405222000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1348229327000,"name":"Gay Catholics, Christians & Friends - Social Group","group_lon":-74,"id":5035262,"urlname":"GayCatholics","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Gay Catholics & Christians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692064881325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442859618000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/d\/9\/f\/600_442236255.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We're back! \u00a0And we're better than ever. \u00a0Our gym is brand new with NBA Stars like Lebron James and Stephen Curry participating in the ribbon cutting ceremony. \u00a0We're hosting an open run for only $10 for 2 hours of basketball at our brand new facilities. \u00a0Sign up before all the spots are taken!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ABCHoopsNYC\/events\/225515305\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":7200000,"name":"Indoor Basketball Full Court Pick Up!","id":"225515305","time":1443378600000,"updated":1443389174000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1327992578000,"name":"ABC Hoops - Indoor Pickup Basketball","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3202582,"urlname":"ABCHoopsNYC","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Basketball Players ballers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11215","country":"us","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"95 Prospect Park West","name":"Long Meadow in Prospect Park","lon":-73.974724,"id":6957082,"state":"NY","lat":40.667065,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.79765939713,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443017860000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/i\/pix\/2012\/09\/11\/article-0-04C30B800000044D-488_468x375.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>Join us for a Sunday picnic in the park. \u00a0And, if you want, play some casual afternoon volleyball. \u00a0We can keep score and play hard but within reason. \u00a0Strong emphasis on a friendly game and fun. \u00a0This is definitely a beginner and novice style game. \u00a0AND the weather looks like it's going to be perfect for hanging in the park. \u00a0<b>Check out the map below for an idea of where we're going to be.<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/7\/d\/600_441211613.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Same routine as the always--we provide the volleyball net and volleyballs, you provide the food, booze, frisbees, plates, cups, etc. Bring a blanket or something to sit on and something to drink out of (more for the alcohol drinkers --open containers aren't a good idea).<\/p> <p><br\/>Don't like volleyball? \u00a0Have no interest in playing? \u00a0No problem. \u00a0Come and enjoy the company, food and\u00a0drinks anyway.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/b\/2\/600_442293970.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Call or text only 516 314 0228 and look for the volleyball nets","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/everythingbrooklyn\/events\/225558831\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":14400000,"name":"Sunday Afternoon Picnic with Volleyball and Drinks","id":"225558831","time":1443378600000,"updated":1443394270000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1339437557000,"name":"Everything Brooklyn","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":4054132,"urlname":"everythingbrooklyn","group_lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Brooklynites"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10007","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"102 North End Avenue","address_2":"@ Vesey Street","lon":-74.015976,"phone":"(212) 945-4370","name":"Regal Battery Park Stadium 11","id":929356,"state":"NY","lat":40.715076,"repinned":false},"headcount":1,"distance":2.77564907074,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442944731000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please note that the movie starts at 2.55 pm.<\/p> <p>This is an event that is 2 parts.<\/p> <p>Part 1 - just watching the movie.<br\/>If you just want to attend the movie, in which case, there will no charge.<\/p> <p>Part 2 - watch the movie followed by dinner.<br\/>If you do wish to eat, where we will eat will depend on how many people decide that they wish to eat.

A graduate of Stanford University and Stanford Medical School, he went on to train at Harvard and in Denver in preparation for a career in emergency medicine and trauma. Dr. Parazynski has numerous publications in the field of space physiology with particular expertise in human adaptation to stressful environments.<\/p> <p>In 1992 he was selected to join NASA's Astronaut Corps and eventually flew 5 Space Shuttle Missions and conducted 7 spacewalks (EVAs). In his 17 years as an Astronaut, he served in numerous senior leadership roles, including EVA Branch Chief and the Lead Astronaut for Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System Inspection &amp; Repair (in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy). Mission highlights include a global ozone mapping mission on STS-66; leading the first joint US-Russian spacewalk during STS-86 while docked to the Russian space station Mir; serving as Senator John Glenn's crewmate and \"personal physician\" during STS-95; and conducting EVA assembly of the Canadian-built space station arm during STS-100.<\/p> <p>In October 2007, Dr. Parazynski led the EVA team on STS-120, a highly complex space station assembly flight, during which he performed 4 EVAs (becoming only the second astronaut to perform four EVAs on a single Space Shuttle mission). The fourth and final EVA is regarded by many as one of the most challenging and dangerous ever performed. During the EVA he was positioned by a 90-foot robotic boom farther than any orbiting astronaut had ever ventured from the safety of their airlock. During this EVA he had to repair a fully energized solar array wing. The tremendous coordinated effort in orbit and on the ground by Mission Control and other engineering experts has been likened to the Space Shuttle and Space Station era's \"Apollo 13 moment.\"<\/p> <p>All told, Dr. Parazynski has spent over 8 weeks in space with more than 47 hours outside on spacewalks. While he has traveled over 23 million miles in orbit he has yet to earn a single frequent flyer mile!<\/p> <p>Jillian Bellovary<br\/>Helen Postdoctoral Fellow\u00a0<br\/>American Museum of Natural History<\/p> <p><br\/>Jillian has a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Washington, and is currently a Helen Postdoctoral Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History. Jillian studies the formation and evolution of massive black holes using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. She is interested in how they form in the early universe, how they grow to become the behemoths we see today, and whether or not we can find them in dwarf galaxies.

This is the address for the NJIT parking deck. At the gate of the parking deck press the red button and tell them that you're at NJIT for an event in the campus center. They'll let you right in. Remember where you parked and then head down to the GITC building (there is a campus map directly outside of the deck). Parking is free.<\/p> <p>Train:<\/p> <p>Take any New Jersey Transit train or the PATH to Newark Penn Station. Get off at the station and go to the main lobby and from there find the McDonalds. When facing the McDonalds make a left to go downstairs to the \"Light Rail\". Buy a ticket from one of the machines and get it stamped. The cost is $1.50 during rush hours (4-6pm), but you are free to buy the \"Underground Fare\" ticket for $0.70 anytime before\/after that rush hour time window. Take the Grove St train and get off at the Warren St\/NJIT station stop. It is 3 stops away (5 minute ride) from Penn Station. When you get off, take the stairway to your left. You will then find a campus map that will help you locate the GITC building.<\/p> <p>Here is the NJ transit map that will help you get to Newark Penn Station:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.njtransit.com\/pdf\/rail\/Rail_System_Map.pdf\">NJ Transit PDF<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Google-Developer-Group-Newark-New-Jersey\/events\/225394490\/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"duration":10800000,"name":"Code Socially","id":"225394490","time":1443477600000,"updated":1443490987000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1408220023000,"name":"Google Developer Group Newark, New Jersey","group_lon":-74.1699981689,"id":16430612,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Newark-New-Jersey","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"2257 1st Ave @ 116th Street","name":"Prime 116","lon":-73.94001,"id":18859202,"state":"NY","lat":40.797955,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.22999572754,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441821572000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for After work Monday at Prime 116!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/9\/2\/600_441807538.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/9\/d\/600_441807549.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>They have extended their happy hour for the group until 9pm.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Martinis buy 1 get 1 free (Apple, Watermelon, &amp; Cosmo)<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$3 Bottled beers<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$6 Margaritas, sangria, &amp; well drinks<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$8 Frozen margaritas<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$10 Frozen margarita\u00a0 &amp; a tequila shot<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$10 Prime swirl-a mix of sangria and frozen margarita<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$8 Empanadas<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$8 Ceviche<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0$8 Pork sliders<\/p> <p>If this is your first time at Prime 116 the venue is known for great drinks and food.

Agenda\/Content: A Demonstration of a parallel computing script using Python and Spark to find the most popular R packages and to visualize the dependency between the R packages.R statistical software capabilities are extended through user-created packages, which, primarily, allow specialized statistical techniques and graphical devices. Any R user is consistently downloading additional packages on his computer and these packages often depend on other packages that also need to be downloaded as a consequence of the intended \u201croot\u201d packages. In his project, Xavier explored the CRAN R project website displaying all the R packages available and the R package download log files and proposed a methodology to extract the most popular R package based on the package dependencies. First, Xavier scrapped the CRAN website, using Spark and Python, for the 7,050+ webpages describing all the R packages in order to download the data related to package dependency and built a dependency matrix using the \u201csparse\u201d matrix concept available within numpy in Python. Then, after downloading the 150 log files (2.5GB+) and using parallel computing, Xavier processed the 47 million line-items contained in the logs using the dependency matrix built previously in order to get only the records related to the \u201croot\u201d packages.Finally, the dependency between all the packages can be visualized using R network graphic packages; the most popular R packages are extracted from the \u201croot\u201d package data and are visualized using Python.<\/p> <p>Through collaboration with Fusion.net, our students delivered a super fan detection tool using shiny app. This project designs a program for charting the influencers and patterns of the Twitter community.

In a career ranging from transportation research to insurance securitization trading and esoteric securities banking, Xavier has deep roots in Data Science. From C and VBA, to SQL, R and Python, Xavier believes in knowing the best-in-breed toolkits. An experienced instructor and consultant in the field of finance, Xavier continues to deepen his abiding interest in prediction through taking the ASA\/CAS actuarial exams (first two completed) and experimenting with machine learning models using Hadoop and Spark.\u00a0Previously at Guggenheim Partners, he is currently a Fellow at the NYC Data Science Academy. \u00a0<\/p> <p>Fangzhou Cheng (MS in Management Information Systems at NYU)Fangzhou\u00a0loves data and hard questions. Having been a journalist in the giant metropolises of Guangzhou, Bejing (CCTV) and NewYork (UN Headquarter), she was fascinated by the power of communication in transforming technology's future. During her masters study in Management Information Systems at NYU, she further developed a love for using data to drive business strategy and performance.\u00a0With skills in Python, R, SQL and Hadoop, she deploy flexible code and devastatingly clear visualizations to tell data-driven stories.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Shu Yan obtained his Ph.D degree in Physics at the University of South Carolina. As a physicist with proficient analytical skills and strong programming background, he brings coding, data science and critical problem solving skills together to tackle real world problems. His\u00a0physical intuition and mathematical reasoning always bring more insight when thinking about\u00a0statistical models and\u00a0machine learning.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As an organizer for President Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, Alex became fascinated with data science when Nate Silver\u2019s 538 accurately predicted the outcome for all 50 states. Alex combines a broad range of knowledge with his data expertise to seek novel solutions to real world phenomena. He loves Python, R, and SQL, and he keeps telling himself he\u2019ll learn Scala some day.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Agenda\/Content:\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>A Demonstration of a\u00a0parallel computing script using Python and Spark\u00a0to find the most popular R packages and to visualize the dependency between the R packages.R statistical software capabilities are extended through user-created packages, which, primarily, allow specialized statistical techniques and graphical devices. Any R user is consistently downloading additional packages on his computer and these packages often depend on other packages that also need to be downloaded as a consequence of the intended \u201croot\u201d packages.\u00a0In his project, Xavier explored the CRAN R project website displaying all the R packages available and the R package download log files and proposed a methodology to extract the most popular R package based on the package dependencies.\u00a0First, Xavier scrapped the CRAN website, using Spark and Python, for the\u00a07,050+ webpages\u00a0describing all the R packages in order to download the data related to package dependency and built a dependency matrix using the \u201csparse\u201d matrix concept available within numpy in Python.\u00a0Then, after downloading the 150 log files (2.5GB+) and using parallel computing, Xavier processed the\u00a047 million line-items contained in the logs using the dependency matrix built previously in order to get only the records related to the \u201croot\u201d packages.Finally, the dependency between all the packages can be visualized using R network graphic packages; the most popular R packages are extracted from the \u201croot\u201d package data and are visualized using Python.<\/p> <p>Through collaboration with Fusion.net, our students delivered a super fan detection tool using shiny app.\u00a0This project designs a program for charting the influencers and patterns of the Twitter community. The findings will be able to help online media companies identify their most important influencers on Twitter and understand their interests, patterns, and behaviors. Furthermore, recommendation systems can be built based on natural language processing ofinfluencers\u2019 Twitter timeline to suggest content to attract their attention.\u00a0<br\/>Recommendation systems have been widely used by news media companies. Just like \u201cRecommended for You\u201d section of NYTimes.com, and \u201cRecommendations\u201d plugin on HuffPost Social News, personalizing the placement of articles on the apps and website has been used to guide news readers to find their most interested articles. The core of the recommendation systems is to recommend the right content to the right people at the right times. While a few recommendation algorithms (such as content-based method and collaborative filtering) are already in the market, this project serves as a basis to find out the influencers in social network, such as Twitter.\u00a0As an extension, this project also uses AlchemyAPI as a natural language processing tool to extract entities and relevance scores from user timeline. This way, the system can understand the user\u2019s interest from everything he\/she has participated in the past.
