Some are professional glamour models, pin up girls, college students, fetish models, topless bartenders, go-go\/berlesque dancers, dominatrix, business executives and even housewives. These ladies all love to be photographed and they are all young, beautiful Gotham Girls living, working and existing in this great gritty city.

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR BEGINNER OR INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS. We sometimes like to go out for beer afterwards. We like players who pass the ball and don't slide tackle. We just like to have fun and meet new people. If this sounds like you, come play!<\/p>\n<p>We use the following rules in our group to make it fair for everyone:<\/p>\n<p>1) Play can be quite fast and aggressive, but friendly. If the ball goes out, call it out even if the other team gets the throw in. Don't argue about every goal. Sometimes you fall down or get kicked, but do not foul. We ask repeat offenders to leave the group.<\/p>\n<p>2) We have no waiting list for games. If a game fills up, you can only jump on a spot if someone cancels. Anyone can come to the game to see if a spot is open, but if it is full, sorry.<\/p>\n<p>3) COME ON TIME. If you are not ready to play at the scheduled start time, you cannot play. If someone is there to play on time, they get your spot. Even if no one else is there to take your spot, you can't play if you come late. We are serious about this.<\/p>\n<p>4) No shows prevent other people from playing, so always cancel as early as possible if you can't make it. WE TAKE THE RSVP LIST ONE HOUR BEFORE THE GAME - AFTER THAT IF YOU CANCEL YOU ARE CONSIDERED A NO SHOW. If you are a no-show multiple times, you will be removed from the Meetup group. This is so that other people can have time to rsvp yes if you cancel.<\/p>\n<p>5) If you play, play the entire scheduled game. It is not fair to people on the waiting list or your teammates if you leave early. We will remove you from the group if you a repeat offender.<\/p>\n<p>6) We'll collect payment in cash at the start of every game. Bring exact change! We use this to get pinnies, cones, goals, better balls, and to pay our monthly Meetup fee.<\/p>\n<p>7) Our pinnies are currently red and neon green. Please do not wear a red, yellow or neon green shirt to games.<\/p>\n<p>See you on the pitch!<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3981826,"name":"Maria S","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/highres_117551512.jpeg","photo_id":117551512,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/member_117551512.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/c\/f\/8\/thumb_117551512.jpeg"}},"members":1043,"name":"Friendly Brooklyn Pickup Soccer","id":8417222,"state":"NY","urlname":"Friendly-Pickup-Soccer-in-Brooklyn","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Futboleros"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1368124862000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"ai","name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":456},{"urlkey":"ixd","name":"Interaction Design","id":10110},{"urlkey":"user-experience","name":"User Experience","id":19243},{"urlkey":"computer-science","name":"Computer Science","id":21751},{"urlkey":"high-scalability-computing","name":"High Scalability Computing","id":24410},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"data-visualization","name":"Data Visualization","id":37381},{"urlkey":"predictive-analytics","name":"Predictive Analytics","id":38458},{"urlkey":"user-research","name":"User Research","id":49541},{"urlkey":"ux-design","name":"UX Design","id":61781},{"urlkey":"human-computer-interaction","name":"human computer interaction","id":71162},{"urlkey":"data-science","name":"Data Science","id":102811},{"urlkey":"mobile-user-experience","name":"Mobile User Experience","id":122974},{"urlkey":"deep-learning","name":"Deep Learning","id":1456952}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACM-NY\/","rating":4.6,"description":"<p><span>ACM New York City is a non-profit professional group that meets regularly to discuss diverse topics in computer science such as user experience, user research, data visualization, predictive analytics, applied machine learning, statistical modeling, open data, and artificial neural networks.

I will keep the Meetup event groups small (less than 20 people and usually around 10).&nbsp; We will be able try a lot of different and better restaurants.&nbsp; I have experienced some of the other larger groups and it is hard to find good restaurants for 20 plus people.&nbsp; They end up scheduling the same places all the time.<\/p>\n<p>2. I will schedule events without confirmed dates to see how many people are interested.&nbsp; Once there is a decent enough interest, I will confirm the date. <br><\/p>\n<p>3. Please do your best to show up to events on time.<\/p>\n<p>4. Please change your RSVP at least 24 hours in advance if you cannot make the event.&nbsp; I am not super strict about kicking out people for not showing up.&nbsp; However, if I schedule a Meetup at a restaurant that has strict reservation rules, I will let you know and please act accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>5.

The community will give you access to world-class fitness equipment, increase your workout time spent outdoors, and offer the ability to push yourself against your peers. What will the meetups consist of? It is simple, tell us what equipment you\u2019re interested in trying out and we will look to have it available for you at the next meetup. We will facilitate exercise sessions using untraditional outdoor fitness equipment such as elliptical bikes, nordic rollerblades, stand up paddle skateboards and anything else our members are interested in getting involved in without incurring the large up-front costs of ownership (not to mention the hassle of storage).

The camera club is conducting an outstanding program of lectures, competitions, and special events. From September to May the club meets twice a month on Thursday evenings at locations in Milltown, NJ. At one meeting we feature member competitions in black-and-white prints, color prints and digital images, at the beginner, advanced and salon levels. Our second monthly meeting consists of lectures, demonstrations, discussions, or activities, such as a studio night. These programs are designed to help the members learn the basics of photography, new techniques for taking pictures, or applications of photography. We also organize field trips to photogenic sites, and a year-end banquet and competition. There are many benefits to joining RPS, such as the right to enter competitions, attend field trips and becoming better photographers. You are cordially invited to come to any of our meetings without becoming a member. However, in order to enter images into our competitions, you must be a dues-paying member.

There were no performance differences between the men and women, but there were <b>significant, sex-specific differences in the brain circuits they activated to complete the task. <\/b> Women triggered brain pathways linked to visual identification and spent more time than men picturing the objects in their minds. This fact merely meant that it took women longer to get to the same answer. It also showed that females perform all the cognitive functions males perform\u2014they just do so by using different brain circuits.\u201d _&lt;a&gt;The Female Brain, by Dr. Louann Brizendine&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> \n<p>The mission of #WomenFix is to take this discovery one step further by showcasing a collection of short stories about how women identify and solve problems. The stories cover a solution or simply an unsolved problem. We hope these stories ignite conversations from men and women about strategies, strength, women's intuition, and to prove or debunk if there is a true difference between how women and men solve problems.<\/p> \n<p>We hope these stories will <b>fill an important historical gap<\/b>. Men have had the opportunity to 'run the show' for most of our existence on Earth so their stories about problem solving are well documented.

popular TechBreakfast format popularized in the Mid-Atlantic and other regions, the NYC TechBreakfast is a \"show and tell\" format event where up to five different technologists will demo their

The event is \"triple agnostic\". We don't care if the technology is from a start up, a large company, a university, a government agency, or someone's hobby. We are also agnostic as to the industry of the tech - it could be IT, biotech, robotics, aerospace, materials sciences, anything tech and innovative is cool.

If you want to be more spontaneous, see the world differently, connect more fully with yourself and others and re-energize your playful self then join us!<\/p>\n<p>Play is a respite from our self-doubts and fears, and opens us up to joy and the freedom that comes from a state of acceptance of our most authentic selves.

And there is so much to do in NYC that I figured I find others like myself who are interested in exploring it with me. So I'm calling all ladies who have a sense of adventure and are willing to make some new friends. I will try to have meets ups at least 4 times a month. And feel free to make suggestions if you have any great ideas. I'm all ears ladies. And if you RSVP yes, please try to attend the meet up or notify me of a cancellation at least 2 hours before.

While many of our members have eliminated employment altogether, others still work full time, part-time, flex-time, night shifts, have home-based businesses, consult or freelance from home, or have chosen alternative, less demanding career paths so that they are more available to their families. Our goal is to support the decisions made by our members. We will never pass judgment on mothers who choose to make or are forced to make different decisions for their families. Our purpose is to foster a nurturing environment where we can share the concerns and challenges of raising children, maintaining our families and ourselves, hoping to create a village of support that extends beyond meetings. Many of us have grown weary being the only black Mom at story time, swim class, etc, we seek to build a community of inclusion to help alleviate the isolation and loneness both stay-at-home and working mothers of color may feel navigating through the adventures of motherhood. Mocha Moms Welcomes people of all religions, races, educational backgrounds and income levels. Mocha Moms, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. Mocha Moms, Inc. does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic level, education, or religion. Anyone who supports the mission and purpose of Mocha Moms, Inc. is welcome to join. For the detailed national mission statement and anti-discrimination language see the national website: www.mochamoms.org Our National History Mocha Moms, Inc. began with the publishing of a newsletter called Mocha Moms in the hopes of connecting at-home mothers of color with each other. The newsletter was intended to encourage these mothers to feel good about their choice as well as to provide information to help them be the best and most important influence in their children\u2019s lives. It was distributed to over 100 moms across the country in the spring of 1997. During the summer of 1997, moms in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland decided to form a support group called Mocha Moms, Inc. There are now over 100 chapters of Mocha Moms, Inc. throughout the United States and the organization is continually growing and evolving to meet the needs of our moms, their families, and the communities they live in.","lon":-73.75,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":106059822,"name":"Queens Mocha Mom","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/highres_170373162.jpeg","photo_id":170373162,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/member_170373162.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/8\/1\/8\/a\/thumb_170373162.jpeg"}},"members":116,"name":"Mocha Moms Queens Chapter","id":9911592,"state":"NY","urlname":"Mocha-Moms-Queens-Chapter","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Mocha Moms"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377124956000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"baking","name":"Baking","id":15718},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"catering","name":"CATERING","id":18885},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"business-entrepreneur-networking","name":"Entrepreneur Networking","id":20060},{"urlkey":"small-business-networking","name":"Small Business Networking","id":20301},{"urlkey":"cooking-dinner-parties","name":"Cooking Dinner Parties","id":21684},{"urlkey":"cooking-classes","name":"Cooking Classes","id":26041},{"urlkey":"business-to-business-marketing","name":"Business to Business Marketing","id":26160},{"urlkey":"cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking","name":"Cooking","id":43256},{"urlkey":"recipes","name":"Recipes","id":50709},{"urlkey":"b2b-networking","name":"B2B Networking","id":65792},{"urlkey":"small-and-home-based-business-marketing","name":"Small and Home-Based Business Marketing","id":84594},{"urlkey":"work-on-your-business-vs-working-in-your-business","name":"Work On your Business VS.

Our goal is to answer (or approximately answer) a well-crafted question. The group runs as follows: 1) The moderator selects one subject for discussion and a date for the meeting. Subjects can be as ephemeral as \"love,\" \"god,\" and \"purpose,\" or as grounded as \"politics,\" \"environmentalism,\" and \"family.\" 2) At the meetup, people are encouraged to propose a question related to the subject. The moderator will collect all of the questions in a list. 3) The group will then vote on the questions. In the first round of voting, each individual may vote for as many questions as they like. The top three will then go to a second round, where each individual may vote just once. 4) The question with the most votes is then discussed. Often, the discussion starts with a narrowing of the question, as it can be challenging to devise a question that can possibly be answered by a small group in just a couple of hours' discussion. If you have a subject you'd like to discuss, feel free to tell the moderator. A list of subjects will be kept and selected from at random each month. One final note: there is no obligation to engage in the discussion. While we encourage everyone to speak if they have something to say, we also welcome those who would rather just observe and learn from others.

From our traderoom in Midtown Manhattan we gather traders with a myriad of methodologies and perspectives to help (1) those now trading enhance their processes and results, and (2) those starting out develop a core trading methodology. In the months ahead we will develop extensions to regular live meet-ups through a free, online trading community to permit members to share ideas, charts, engage in discussions, deal with the ups and downs of this business, overcome inertia in getting off the ground, and other subjects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For those bouncing from one approach to another, looking at dozens of webinars and being bombarded by miracle systems in emails, getting started is daunting. Besides regular monthly in-person gatherings, we will have a free extension to let people share what they're doing, which can act as a trigger for aspiring traders to identify trade-styles and methods that resonate for them. Trading isn't one-size-fits-all. <\/p>\n<p>Those who are progressing are always looking to continue their advancement. Trading is a journey and an evolution. For those of you comfortable with your progress, you know there's always something new to learn and no part of your process is ever perfect. Sometimes your progress stalls. Talking to the right person or hearing about something someone else is doing that resonates for you can be the catalyst for another leap forward. Maybe it's the force that spurs your advancement and makes you (more) profitable. <br><\/p>\n<p><i><b>\u2022 Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT THE ORGANIZER <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I'm Mitch Firestone, a full-time trader here in NYC. I live in Chelsea and work out of a traderoom in Midtown West. I have stepped up to become the new organizer of NYCTTT so want to introduce myself.<\/p>\n<p>I've been trading successfully for a living for 3+ years, supporting myself and my family 100% through trading: (1) day- and swing-trading equities (2) options and (3) intraday futures. Now three years into being fully confident in my individual trading, I started coaching aspiring and intermediate traders about 18 months ago, and in the last six months decided to become involved in the trading \u201ccommunity.\u201d This includes hosting meet-ups, a graduate group where I received my trading education, as well developing Precision Trading Laboratories, a trading-connected business with my friend and business partner Ryan here in the traderoom.<\/p>\n<p>I'm currently a co-organizer in another NYC trading meet-up I'm quite proud of, but when I saw NYCTTT was dormant I decided to step up. I've got some ideas about shepherding a trading meet-up that's not only a stand-alone monthly meeting, but also a trading community that will benefit all involved.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Why do this?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I have a passion for trading and the markets. I enjoy talking about them and interacting with others with the same passion.<\/p>\n<p>I remember how I felt when I was trying to find my way. To help others through this always makes me feel good. Seeing the light-bulb go off over someone's head or getting a phone call about how someone's P&amp;L has gone green is gratifying and fun. I was recently at a trading social function with a successful student of mine and hearing him glowingly describe me as his mentor was a great feeling.<\/p>\n<p>I am always learning from others. Putting together a group of intermediate and advanced traders and committed, dedicated beginners can be a fantastic mix if correctly done. <\/p>\n<p>The act of teaching and preparing for presentations forces me to constantly evaluate my process and makes be better able to react, analyze and explain trading scenarios. This makes me sharper, more knowledgeable, and makes me a better trader. With the reboot of NYCTTT, those in the group who present their knowledge and lead discussions will find the same benefits.<\/p>\n<p>I love trading. Having said that, for many it's a solitary endeavor, which led me to the traderoom. Little did I know that not only would it be socially better, but it accelerated my progress. While I was successful with stocks and options, I was less so with futures. That all changed sitting next to my buddy Ryan here for six months. That sort of effect can arise within this group with the right structure, an extension of the group now being worked on, and interest and commitment from our members.<\/p>\n<p>I've got some ideas about turning this meet-up into a living trading community and I'd love to work with interested members to get this off the ground. As I said, I work out of a traderoom in Midtown West that can host this group early weekday evenings, and have some thoughts about how to extend the group beyond the in-person meet-up..<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<i><b>Come join us!!!<\/b><\/i><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/highres_438749520.jpeg","photo_id":438749520,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/600_438749520.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/3\/5\/0\/thumb_438749520.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":43499082,"name":"Mitch Firestone","photo":{"photo_id":48558332,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/9\/c\/member_48558332.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/7\/9\/c\/thumb_48558332.jpeg"}},"members":349,"name":"NYC Technical Trader Talks","id":10010282,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Technical-Trader-Talks","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Traders"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377713420000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"film","name":"Film","id":15029},{"urlkey":"reading","name":"Reading","id":15360},{"urlkey":"film-festivals","name":"Film Festivals","id":18495},{"urlkey":"concerts","name":"Concerts","id":18909},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"dinner-and-a-movie","name":"Dinner and a Movie","id":23778},{"urlkey":"filmmakers-screenwriters-other-film-crew","name":"Filmmakers, Screenwriters & Other Film Crew","id":38598},{"urlkey":"indie-filmmaking","name":"Indie Filmmaking","id":152559},{"urlkey":"screenwriter","name":"screenwriter","id":167861},{"urlkey":"short-films-for-film-festivals","name":"Short Films for Film Festivals","id":1058452}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Indie-Films-Fans\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Lovers of film<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":108773642,"name":"Gary T."},"members":199,"name":"Indie Films Fans","id":10010342,"state":"NY","urlname":"Indie-Films-Fans","category":{"name":"movies\/film","id":20,"shortname":"movies-film"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Filmmakers & Actors"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377713794000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"homeschool","name":"Homeschooling","id":603},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"working-parents","name":"Working Parents","id":15786},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"school","name":"School","id":17017},{"urlkey":"school-age-children","name":"School-Age Kids","id":17705},{"urlkey":"public-school","name":"Public School","id":20182},{"urlkey":"single-parties","name":"Single Parents","id":59433},{"urlkey":"middle-school","name":"Middle School","id":72327},{"urlkey":"high-school","name":"High School","id":101296},{"urlkey":"nyc-parents","name":"NYC parents","id":164729},{"urlkey":"middle-school-parents","name":"middle school parents","id":426582}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-High-School-Admissions-101\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This group is dedicated to providing support and resources for families thinking about or going through NYC high school admissions.

But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Inner Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>How does energy flow work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Inner Energy flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your Inner Energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your Inner Energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to fall into the state of meditation, rather than having to perform meditation, as is the case with many forms of meditation. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness \u2014 mental silence \u2014 is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Recent studies conducted by Dr. Ramesh Manocha suggest that thoughtless awareness or mental silence has more impact, experientially and physiologically, than simple relaxation or generic meditation. Sahaja Meditation's mental silence approach to meditation, when compared to a \u201cnon-mental silence\u201d approach, was shown to be, on average, twice as effective in reducing work-related stress, general depressive symptoms and anxiety. Sahaja is much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. If you choose to explore it in depth, it can be a transformative path to achieving your highest potential, reaching a higher plane of knowledge and awareness, and living in peace and contentment.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Physical and emotional health and well-being<\/strong><br>\n\n Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the mental and physical health benefits provided by regular practice of Sahaja. For example:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n \u2022 Stress management and emotional resilience. Stress, in one way or another, contributes to all mental and physical health problems. The sense of inner calm you experience during thoughtless awareness boosts your emotional resilience, which helps you effectively cope with stressful events in the future. Regular meditation activates a built-in stress management mechanism that helps your cope with stressors on an ongoing basis. Thoughtless awareness enables you to influence your Inner Energy; in other words, influence your central nervous system to heal and improve yourself.<br>\n\n \u2022 Depression and anxiety relief. Sahaja Meditation helps relieve depression and anxiety symptoms and has been shown to increase positive emotions by influencing neurochemicals released by the limbic (emotional) system (e.g., beta-endorphins). Sahaja revitalizes energy and restores optimism, peace and contentment. Meditation helps manage anger, relieve fear and anxiety, erase negative thoughts and feelings, improve self-esteem, and restore a sense of balance, self-control and well-being. You're better equipped to confront and solve your problems, rather than just feel guilty about your mistakes.<br>\n\n \u2022 Prevention and treatment of illnesses, including: epilepsy, hypertension and cardiac diseases, asthma and respiratory illnesses, migraine syndrome, and menopausal symptoms<br>\n\n \u2022 Structurally alters the brain. A recent study at Massachusetts General Hospital, (Harvard Medical School teaching hospital), showed that the regular practice of meditation may produce structural changes in areas of the brain associated with attention and sensory processing.<br>\n\n \u2022 Boosts immune system and slows aging. By improving overall health, Sahaja helps your body manufacture more disease-fighting cells (T-cells). Thoughtless awareness, combined with the ongoing nourishent of Inner Energy, helps slow aging by keeping your mind and body revitalized and rejuvenated. The Mass General study also showed that meditation may help slow aging by reducing thinning of the cortex.<br>\n\n \u2022 Reduction of Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder symptoms, such as attention deficit problems, impulsiveness, hyperactivity and conflict in interpersonal relationships in all settings (school, workplace, social and family). Family-oriented AD\/HD studies of meditation have also shown that parents reported feeling happier, less stressed and better able to manage their child\u2019s behavior.<br>\n\n \u2022 Pain reduction. NIH-funded neuroimaging studies found that long-term meditation can mitigate the brain's response to pain by 40 to 50 percent. In other words, meditation is actually capable of modifying how the brain perceives pain, which could be good news for chronic pain sufferers.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n It's important to mention that treatment or cure is a coincidental benefit of Sahaja Meditation \u2014 a wonderful byproduct \u2014 not Sahaja's ultimate goal. Healing is not Sahaja's core objective, nor was Sahaja Meditation intended to be a formal system of treatments for diseases and disorders. Having said that, healing \u2014 and long-term wellness \u2014 begins with harnessing your own untapped energy. So at the very least, Sahaja Meditation is a great place to start.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Personal Development, Self-Actualization, Personality and Relationships<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation increases self-awareness, intuition and introspectiveness \u2014 all qualities that improve your communication skills and increase your compassion and empathy for others. Once you've awakened your Inner Energy through meditation, your attention turns inward \u2014 deep inside yourself, to your own energy centers. Through your own internal process of self-awareness and self-realization, your sensitivity to the feelings of others feelings automatically increases and it becomes easier to put yourself in someone else's shoes. You're better able to visualize and understand how others might feel or anticipate someone's reactions to your own words and deeds.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You begin to focus more on how to improve yourself. You focus on self-improvement through introspection and self-examination, rather than seeking solutions externally through other people, situations, or circumstances. This alone brings about powerful personality changes and builds a foundation for positive interactions with others and strong, pure relationships. The people around you quickly notice your improved attitude, and that you are surrounded by an aura of peace and contentment. You become peaceful from within. As meditation continues to nourish your energy centers over time, people find you to be pleasant to be around and view you as someone who has valuable advice to offer.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Sahaja Meditation techniques can teach you to gauge the state of your own energy centers and become adept at pinpointing the location of blockages (known as 'catches'). Each energy center is associated with a set of qualities. So a problem in an energy center means a problem with the quality associated with that center.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n You'll have live and constant feedback of what's going on with your mind and body \u2014 a powerful self-diagnostic tool that allows you to quickly pinpoint and solve problems. Sahaja helps you analyze your own feelings \u2014 whether positive or negative \u2014 and determine what's triggering them. Negative emotions fade (e.g., feeling guilty for past mistakes) and the trajectory of your life becomes an ascending spiral.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>The spiritual face of Sahaja Meditation<\/strong><br>\n\n For those who choose to explore its depths, Sahaja Meditation can deliver benefits on two powerful dimensions: (1) the rejuvenating experiential aspect and true improvement of oneself and; (2) growth and understanding of spiritual knowledge. Regular practice of Sahaja Meditation can illuminate the true meaning of spirituality and what the journey of spirituality can mean in your life, not tethered to any religion or \"rules.\" The ability to influence the subtle energy system is a thoroughly modern solution with origins revealed in ancient scriptures more than 14,000 years ago. Sahaja can open up a whole world of knowledge known to very few. Attempting to fully articulate the Sahaja spiritual experience is like trying to describe the magnificent beauty of the ocean floor in all its living, miraculous complexity to someone who's standing on the shore, asking what lies beneath the surface of the ocean. No matter how hard you try to describe what can be found in the depths of the ocean, it can only be truly experienced if you dive to those depths yourself.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>What to expect from a Sahaja Meditation class<\/strong><br>\n\n First, all classes are free, no strings attached. There's nothing to buy, now or ever. It's against Sahaja principles to charge money for helping others awaken the energy that we were all born with. Sahaja instructors feel that spirituality should not be equated with money and commerce.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>And Sahaja Meditation is a \"family practice.\"<\/strong> We welcome all ages. Walk-ins are welcome.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Overview. The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness or mental silence. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And I'm always available to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n About our sessions. Classes are conducted in a peaceful environment; soothing background music helps facilitate meditation. Meditations are guided by instructors and are designed to accommodate the collective experience. Individual assistance (both beginner and advanced) is always available. While the actual practice of meditation forms the core of our sessions, sessions may also include discussions of, for example, specific aspects of the subtle energy system. But it's not all \"serious.\" There's also plenty of opportunity to enjoy casual conversations and share experiences with others.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The power of collective meditation. Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Once you have awakened your Inner Energy, you may find that the benefits of meditation are compounded when you meditate in a group of people who are \"on the same frequency;\" i.e., connecting to the collective universal energy at the same time and place. Think of it as a network of computer servers linked to each other\u2026 each can access and share resources of the other, and as a group, they form a powerful network of resources. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Meditating at home. You can meditate anytime in any quiet environment. Once your Inner Energy has been awakened, the technique simply involves easing into the state of meditation to raise the energy, then gradually easing out of it to carry on with your day. You're likely to find your solo meditations to be much more beneficial if you have first attended a class where expert Sahaja practitioners are on hand to help.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n What Sahaja Meditation holds in store for you, personally, is up to you. You can devote as much time to it or as little as you wish. But like everything else in life, the benefits you reap will generally be commensurate with the amount of time and effort you invest. As with a physical fitness program, for example, you must have knowledge and understanding of the techniques, as well as the motivation and maturity to pursue the fitness routine. You must enter into the experience with an open mind, a belief that it can work and a willingness to work, or the program won't achieve a high level of success. And as with any physical fitness program you undertake, meditation results may vary, depending on variables such as how fit you are when you begin the program and how hard you work on an ongoing basis. But typically, two 10 to 15-minute-sessions per day will yield significant benefits.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Contact us at 973-506-9515 or send us a message for any questions.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Visit www.sahajameditation.com, www.sahajameditationbenefits.com for more details.<\/p>","lon":-74.3799972534,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/highres_277668272.jpeg","photo_id":277668272,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/600_277668272.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/9\/0\/thumb_277668272.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12407024,"name":"Nirmal K Mukhi"},"members":116,"name":"The Morris County Sahaja Meditation Group","id":10049382,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Morris-County-Meditation","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Meditation Practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377987030000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","id":7029},{"urlkey":"ria","name":"Rich Internet Applications","id":9886},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"ext-js","name":"Ext JS","id":70707},{"urlkey":"mobile-web","name":"Mobile Web","id":78586},{"urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks","id":85951},{"urlkey":"sencha-touch","name":"Sencha Touch","id":116642},{"urlkey":"sencha-ext-js","name":"Sencha Ext JS","id":116856},{"urlkey":"sencha","name":"Sencha","id":129312},{"urlkey":"cross-platform-mobile","name":"Cross-platform Mobile","id":846132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Sencha-Users\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>The purpose of this group is to bring smart people together and learn how to develop amazing apps with Ext JS and Sencha Touch.

(ABSC), formerly known as the American Buddhist Academy, was founded in 1951 by the late Reverend Hozen Seki as a Buddhist cultural center. Rev. Seki sought to provide a Buddhist study center for people interested in learning more about the Buddhist teachings with particular emphasis toward Shin Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>The Center is located on Riverside Drive near 105th Street on the upper West Side of New York City immediately adjacent to the New York Buddhist Temple. It is within walking distance to many of New York\u2019s finest schools and universities including Columbia, Barnard, Manhattan College, City College, NYU and theological seminaries.<\/p>\n<p>ABSC runs a full schedule of Buddhist programs and events throughout the year. From lecturer series, workshops, book discussion groups to afternoon movie series. Besides these activities the Center also publishes the Natural Way newsletter, booklets and other publications.<\/p>\n<p>The crown jewel of the center is its Buddhist reference and research library. There are over ten thousand volumes of Buddhist texts, manuscripts, and sutras. Many in the ABSC collection are very rare and priceless. There are books on Tibet Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Shin and Zen Buddhism. ABSC has one of the best Buddhist collections of Shin Buddhist works on the East Coast.<\/p>\n<p>Through the years many famous Buddhist scholars have given lectures and workshops at the center. One of the most notable was D.T. Suzuki, who in 1958 gave a series of lectures that were published by Harper and Row entitled Shin Buddhism, in 1970. Then a second edition was later published by Shambhala in a new introduction by Taitetsu Unno, entitled Buddha of Infinite Light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shinran Shonin Statue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today in front of the New York Buddhist Church stands a fifteen foot high bronze statue of Shinran Shonin, the founder of Shin Buddhism. This statue was a generous gift from Mr. Hirose, a Japanese industrialist, to the American Buddhist Academy. During WWII the Shinran Shonin statue stood in front of a Buddhist temple in Hiroshima. As metals became scarce in Japan many bronze statues and ornaments were melted down to be used for the war effort. The Shinran Shonin statue survived, while other Buddhist and religious ornaments were not so lucky. Then on August 6, 1946, the Shinran Shonin statue withstood its greatest test by surviving the Atomic bomb blast over Hiroshima. After the war Mr. Hirose wanted this statue to represent world peace, and Rev. Seki convinced Mr. Hirose to ship it to New York City, the crossroads of the world. On September 11, 1955, the statue was unveiled in the courtyard of the American Buddhist Academy. There D.T. Suzuki gave his key note address for world peace and harmony. This year, 2008 marks the 53rd anniversary of the occasion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Shin Buddhism, also known as Jodo Shinshu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most important realization for Shin Buddhists is the attainment of shinjin, which occurs in our present life. Shinjin is true entrusting in the Immeasurable Life and Light of the compassionate Amida Buddha and the Primal Vow. This spiritual transformation takes place in our present life, not after death. We become aware of the oneness with all life surrounding us through our deepened understanding of the basic tenets of Buddhism, which include the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold paths, dependent origination, and impermanence. For the Shin Buddhist to realize this oneness is due to the working of Other Power, which is none other then Amida\u2019s Primal Vow. It is within this Vow that we take notice of our intimate interconnectedness with others and with all life. As Shinran Shonin wrote in 1250 \u201cThus, when we simply let the karmic retribution of whatever good or evil we might have play itself out, and we turn to believe solely in the true vow, that is other power.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>The New York Buddhist Church (NYBC) is a temple of Jodoshinshu True Pure Land School Buddhism, whose head temple is Nishi-Hongwanji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. Shinran Shonin (1173-1262) is the founder of this school of Buddhism.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>The NYBC has been serving the New York community since 1938, and was founded by Rev. Hozen Seki with the assistance of his wife, Satomi, and concerned lay people. They all wished to share the Buddha-Dharma in America's most populous city, which then had no center for Jodoshinshu Buddhism. Their wishes have flourished as today we continue to share the Buddha-Dharma here in New York.<\/span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span>May the Wisdom and Compassion of Amida Buddha touch your heart so that you may be awakened to the world of True Dharma with Nembutsu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","lon":-73.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/highres_279786342.jpeg","photo_id":279786342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/600_279786342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/c\/6\/thumb_279786342.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":1512390,"name":"Mariko","photo":{"photo_id":82801822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/e\/member_82801822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/1\/e\/thumb_82801822.jpeg"}},"members":193,"name":"American Buddhist Study Center and New York Buddhist Church","id":10108852,"state":"NY","urlname":"ABSCNYBC","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Attendees"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378337760000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"polyamory","name":"Polyamory","id":494},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"intimacy","name":"Intimacy","id":15187},{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"open-relationships","name":"Open Relationships","id":19785},{"urlkey":"dating-and-relationships","name":"Dating and Relationships","id":20246},{"urlkey":"swingers-parties","name":"Swingers Parties","id":22971},{"urlkey":"nudist-naturists","name":"Naturist","id":23517},{"urlkey":"alternative-lifestyles","name":"Alternative Lifestyles","id":24818},{"urlkey":"kinky","name":"Kinky","id":28523},{"urlkey":"swinger","name":"Swingers","id":61474},{"urlkey":"celebrate-sensuality","name":"Sensuality","id":93385},{"urlkey":"kinky-fetishes-bdsm","name":"Kinky - Fetishes & BDSM","id":165968},{"urlkey":"polyamory-and-open-relationships","name":"Polyamory and Open Relationships","id":167798}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Scene-NYC\/","rating":3,"description":"<p>Over the years we\u2019ve successfully harnessed all that an underground playground has to offer.

Although it is a fast and energetic dance, it flows smoothly and the moves are continuous and rhythmic, and dancers follow circular movements as they relate to each other. One way in which the present Porto-Seguro style differs from the orig<span>inal Kaoma-like Lambada style, is that the they have removed wiggling shoulder movements (also sometimes seen in Cuban-style salsa). Instead the shoulders are kept fixed while the hips move (swing) to create a sensual effect. A number of movements have been added to the modern version of this dance (many created by Didi Santos of Brazil). Porto Seguro style is so prominent in Lambazouk that the two are often considered synonymous, not to mention, even the most celebrated Porto Seguro dancers call themselves Lambazouk dancers.<br>\n\nLambazouk is characterized by the following movements:<br>\n\n<br>\n\nCabe\u00e7a.<br>\n\nBoneca.<br>\n\nChicote.<br>\n\nCambre.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is danced to rhythmic, up-tempo music (tempo is generally fast or medium, rarely slow). Kizomba music is very popular in Lambazouk owing to its rhythm and pace. Because the music faster, and head movements are more sophisticated and done more often, dancing Lambazouk requires better technique and timing in order to perform head movements without injuries.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nLambazouk is mainly danced in Porto Seguro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Argentina, Spain, Israel, UK, US, Israel, Japan &amp; recently also in Malaysia. LambaZouk is also evolving to include more modern movements. It is also not uncommon (lately) for dancers to switch fluently between these dancing styles during a single Zouk music song.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/highres_348498322.jpeg","photo_id":348498322,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/600_348498322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/7\/9\/2\/thumb_348498322.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":8379582,"name":"Hisa","photo":{"photo_id":144664942,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/4\/e\/member_144664942.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/3\/4\/e\/thumb_144664942.jpeg"}},"members":125,"name":"Dan\u00e7a Brasil, Lambazouk, Samba e Forro","id":10135062,"state":"NY","urlname":"Danca-Brasileira-Zouk-Lambada-Samba-e-Forro","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Dancers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1378477302000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"screenwriters","name":"Screenwriting","id":567},{"urlkey":"indiefilm","name":"Indie Films","id":914},{"urlkey":"film-and-video-production","name":"Film and Video Production","id":20021},{"urlkey":"local-filmmakers","name":"Local Filmmakers","id":22984},{"urlkey":"gorilla-filmmaking-film-shorts-for-film-festivals","name":"Gorilla filmmaking, Film shorts for Film Festivals","id":26000},{"urlkey":"film-production","name":"Film Production","id":26681},{"urlkey":"film-makers","name":"Filmmaking","id":31082},{"urlkey":"independent-filmmakers","name":"Independent Filmmaking","id":48847},{"urlkey":"online-filmmaking","name":"Online Filmmaking","id":64061},{"urlkey":"micro-budget-filmmaking","name":"Micro Budget Filmmaking","id":76190},{"urlkey":"allowing-filmmakers-to-improve-their-skills","name":"Allowing Filmmakers to Improve their Skills","id":78403},{"urlkey":"low-budget-filmmaking","name":"Low Budget Filmmaking","id":124947},{"urlkey":"indie-filmmaking","name":"Indie Filmmaking","id":152559},{"urlkey":"guerilla-filmmaking","name":"Guerilla Filmmaking","id":249101},{"urlkey":"filmmaking-network","name":"filmmaking network","id":640022}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Zorkas-Creatives\/","rating":3.75,"description":"<p>Our group is dedicated to helping new creatives take that first step in creating a career in film and photography.

As a result, Hoboken residents and businesses had a very difficult time communicating with each other, with our local government, and with friends and family outside our community. We can't let Hoboken go off the grid like this again. And we can't wait for Verizon or Cablevision to harden their systems. Despite repeated calls from Congress and the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry is resisting new requirements for backup power for cell sites and other critical communications facilities. We have to fix this problem ourselves so that our community is prepared for the next big crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A new technology called mesh wireless networking offers a fast, relatively inexpensive way to quickly build an open, free, redundant local network in Hoboken. It has been tested in Brooklyn where it proved highly resilient and provided lifeline Internet service to hundreds of people despite extensive flooding similar to what we saw here. We think it can work here too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We are an adhoc volunteer group of entrepreneurs, technologists and community activists who want to launch a barn-raising style effort to build a mesh network here in Hoboken.<\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/8\/highres_290235432.jpeg","photo_id":290235432,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/8\/600_290235432.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/c\/4\/8\/thumb_290235432.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":68584372,"name":"Allan Zuniga","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/5\/e\/highres_148868542.jpeg","photo_id":148868542,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/5\/e\/member_148868542.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/1\/5\/e\/thumb_148868542.jpeg"}},"members":37,"name":"MileMesh: Hoboken's Safety Net","id":10538602,"state":"NJ","urlname":"MileMesh","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"MileMeshers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1380825292000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"first-baby","name":"First baby","id":16791},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"moms-night-out","name":"Mom's Night Out","id":23946},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"hip-mamas","name":"Hip  Mamas","id":41439}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ChelseaMoms\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Welcome to Chelsea Moms<br>\n\n Everything happening in Chelsea of NYC<\/p>\n<p>You are in the perfect place to meet other moms living in Chelsea to have playdates, check out the neighborhood or just chat and have fun.

A chosen few get all the attention while rest of the attendees do nothing more than exchange business cards.\u00a0<span>Our goal is to provide a level playing field to everyone because it is our belief that you learn more from people who are \"in the same boat\" rather than from superstars who have \"been there, done that\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We want to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, providers and others from the startup ecosystem. Together, we will build a community that is completely focused on providing high-value to # STARTUP members.

I found that time and time again, people not knowing how to use the various features of their cameras is what holds back their progress. Spend some time learning how to manually control your camera, it is time well spent. Also do a little planning and prep work before coming to the meetup, it will help you take better pictures. <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/f\/600_435361055.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p>(Photos above were taken during our Light-painting meetup events in 2014) <br><\/p>\n<p>Some forms of photography require two people or more people working the equipment behind the scenes to effectively pull off a shot such as in the lightpainting shots above. A camera that can be controlled using manual settings and a sturdy tripod are the most basic pieces of equipment you will need for this group. All the photos shown on this page were taken using long exposure and sturdy tripods. (Below - HDR of Eiffel Tower at twilight, using bracketed 2 - 8 second time exposures)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/1\/5\/6\/event_296060822.jpeg\" height=\"162\" width=\"239\"><\/p>\n<p>Although not required, sometimes, additional equipment is needed such as&nbsp; flashlight(s), flash(s), wireless triggers, etc... for our light painting or off camera flash events (depending what you want to do). <br><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I really encourage you to learn the software that has changed the way we develop photos. Probably the #1 program that has helped photographers make amazing shots is Adobe Photoshop. If you haven't learned it yet, I suggest you spend some time with this amazing program. I also encourage you to learn Lightroom. There are also many free programs available that one can learn to help achieve the effect you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>So bring what equipment you have as well as a open mind let's make some cool photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a great idea for an unusal photo, either make a comment on the group page or come to our group meeting and let us know, we may choose to make it a group project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Experimental-Photography\/pages\/Membership_Policy_and_Liability_Waiver\/\">Click here to see Membership policies<\/a> in order to join.<\/strong><\/p>","lon":-73.9400024414,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/highres_438563205.jpeg","photo_id":438563205,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/600_438563205.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/a\/5\/thumb_438563205.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":4556764,"name":"Patrick","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/highres_246147481.jpeg","photo_id":246147481,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/member_246147481.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/5\/9\/thumb_246147481.jpeg"}},"members":133,"name":"NYC Experimental Photography","id":10755002,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Experimental-Photography","category":{"name":"photography","id":27,"shortname":"photography"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Experimental Photographers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Hoboken","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382239179000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"travel","name":"Travel","id":1998},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"expat","name":"Expat","id":4446},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"movie-nights","name":"Movie Nights","id":15940},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"foodie","name":"Foodie","id":18528},{"urlkey":"hoboken","name":"Hoboken","id":42476}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HIFgroup\/","rating":4.92,"description":"<p>Did you move to Hoboken from another country?

While instrumental music of all kinds is well represented in New York concerts, it is rare that electroacoustic music is heard, and often works are not presented in the kind of ambience that they need. In order to improve this situation, we have organized large festivals of electroacoustic music in 2009, 2010, and 2013 (http:\/\/www.nycemf.org). We now propose to expand these events and create an organization devoted exclusively to electroacoustic music in New York City: the New York City Electroacoustic Music Society.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n We invite you to join and become a member of this group. The organization will consist of composers, performers, and supporters of electroacoustic music.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>I very intentionally use the word&nbsp;\u201cmedicine\u201d&nbsp;when I speak about sacred plants.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;because&nbsp;in my opinion this work deserves reverence and respect.&nbsp; We engage this work&nbsp;consciously and with awareness of the profound changes we are making, not just in our own lives, but in the lives of those around us.&nbsp; When we invite the sacred plants into our lives, we do so so we can learn from them, grow with them, and from their divine wisdom, encounter the wisdom alive within each of us. &nbsp; <br>I do not support the plants&nbsp;being used recreationally, to&nbsp;\u201cget high\u201d or have&nbsp;\u201ca trip\u201d, nor do I support the plants being administered by anyone who does not have proper training,&nbsp;experience, and intention. <br><\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life.&nbsp; <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose.&nbsp; <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops.&nbsp; <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns.&nbsp; <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have.&nbsp; <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies.&nbsp; <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing.&nbsp; <br>-Access to virtual and live events <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners.&nbsp; <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products.&nbsp; <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":2449,"name":"Sacred Plants NYC","id":10833812,"state":"NY","urlname":"sacredplantsnyc","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Journeyers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382728937000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"magic-the-gathering","name":"Magic the Gathering","id":25717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Startup-Nerds-Gather-for-Magic\/","rating":4.86,"description":"<p>Private group for cool people and their friends that work for technology companies in NYC to play MTG.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":20957661,"name":"Daniel Son"},"members":66,"name":"NYC Internet People Play Magic","id":10841252,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Startup-Nerds-Gather-for-Magic","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"gatherers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1382794976000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"dogtraining","name":"Dog Training","id":10024},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-behavioral-training","name":"Dog Behavioral Training","id":35157},{"urlkey":"helping-reactive-rescue-dogs","name":"Helping Reactive, Rescue Dogs","id":38430},{"urlkey":"linking-with-other-dog-owners","name":"Linking with other Dog Owners","id":46918},{"urlkey":"dog-obedience-and-behavioral-training","name":"Dog Obedience and Behavioral Training","id":49853},{"urlkey":"dog-owners","name":"Dog Owners","id":55535},{"urlkey":"dog-behavior-and-training","name":"Dog Behavior and Training","id":91169},{"urlkey":"dog-obedience-training-and-problem-solving","name":"Dog Obedience Training and Problem Solving","id":116266},{"urlkey":"helping-rescue-dogs-become-pets","name":"Helping Rescue Dogs Become Pets","id":154507},{"urlkey":"shelter-and-rescue-dogs","name":"Shelter and Rescue Dogs","id":158992},{"urlkey":"understanding-dogs","name":"understanding dogs","id":414532},{"urlkey":"canine-behavior-science-positive-reinforcement","name":"canine behavior science - positive reinforcement","id":766802}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rescue-Dog-Owners-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"Rescue dogs are amazing animals.

Walking is the number one activity people report for getting the recommended amount of physical activity. Walking with friends and colleagues helps you stay motivated and continue &nbsp;a life-long health behavior. This is a group for anyone interested in walking, being social, and advocating for pedestrian safety.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Physical Activity Guidelines&nbsp;for Americans recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination each week. The guidelines also recommend that children and adolescents be active for at least 60 minutes every day. Following these guidelines can contribute to overall health, and decrease the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Walking is a great way to get the physical activity needed to obtain health benefits. Walking does not require any special skills. It also does not require a gym membership or expensive equipment.<\/p>\n<p><span>Individuals have to make the decision to walk. However, the decision can be made easier by improvements to community walkability and by programs and policies that provide opportunities and encouragement for walking. Individuals and partners working together can make walking a national priority and create a national walking movement. A role exists for all sectors of society, including transportation, land use, and community design; parks, recreation, and fitness; education; business and industry; volunteer and nonprofit organizations; health care; media; and public health. Families and individuals also have an important role to play to help make the U.S. a walkable nation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Ask me about our walking Audits!<\/p>\n<p><span>liz.brady13@gmail.com for more information.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<p> <br> <\/p>\n<br>\n<p><span> <br> <\/span><\/p>","lon":-74.2200012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/9\/highres_442047321.jpeg","photo_id":442047321,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/9\/600_442047321.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/b\/9\/thumb_442047321.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":119086482,"name":"Liz Brady","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/c\/highres_157509292.jpeg","photo_id":157509292,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/c\/member_157509292.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/c\/thumb_157509292.jpeg"}},"members":106,"name":"Lets Walk!","id":11015732,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Lets-all-walk-together","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Walking Buddies"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1383885059000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"reladvice","name":"Relationship Advice","id":3301},{"urlkey":"womens-empowerment","name":"Women's Empowerment","id":17933},{"urlkey":"successful-relationships","name":"Successful Relationships","id":22480},{"urlkey":"breakup-support-group","name":"Breakup Support Group","id":37692},{"urlkey":"relationship-building","name":"Relationship Building","id":49581},{"urlkey":"confidence-and-self-esteem","name":"Confidence and Self-Esteem","id":63753},{"urlkey":"getting-over-a-breakup","name":"Getting Over a Breakup","id":67418},{"urlkey":"breakup-of-a-relationship","name":"Breakup of a Relationship","id":89377},{"urlkey":"women-supporting-women-in-relationships","name":"Women Supporting Women in Relationships","id":119301},{"urlkey":"relationship-support","name":"Relationship Support","id":119303},{"urlkey":"healing-and-empowering-relationships","name":"Healing and Empowering Relationships","id":751442}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/HimADDICTION-New-York-Relationship-and-Breakup-Support\/","rating":4.75,"description":"<p>You can't stop thinking about him, talking about him or calling him because you are worried he is with someone else!

L. Levin) has a rare gift for making the teachings of Sufism accessible to westerners and teaches in a very grounded way, distilling esoteric concepts into useable and understandable language. Musa is a direct disciple of the Sufi Saint Bawa Muhaiyaddeen.&nbsp;As Musa explains, Sufism goes beyond all languages, religions and cultural backgrounds. This is a path open to all seekers of the unseen, those striving to connect to their spiritual inner life, to give new meaning and direction that is easily put into practice.<\/p>\n<p>You can hear many of Musa's discourses on his website at <a>www.thewitnesswithin.com.<\/a> His latest book, The Elixir of Truth: Journey on the Sufi Path, is available through Amazon.com.<\/p>\n<p>To quote Musa, \u201cThere is this mystery of man\u2019s relationship to God. Every person has this relationship. We need to explore this relationship, and make that exploration something that is a life-long priority. We identify with our bodies, but we are not our body.

This is also not a group for women looking for a back up plan for a particular evening or as a place holder in case one can't find something better to do and anyone who uses the group in that manner will be removed.<br><\/p>","lon":-73.6299972534,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":12073186,"name":"Victoria","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/b\/highres_11805003.jpeg","photo_id":11805003,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/b\/member_11805003.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/f\/c\/b\/thumb_11805003.jpeg"}},"members":36,"name":"Girlfriends of Westchester and Lower Fairfield","id":11252562,"state":"CT","urlname":"Westchester-girlfriends","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":41.0400009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1385581753000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"bornagain","name":"Born Again Christian","id":602},{"urlkey":"biblestudy","name":"Bible Study","id":2353},{"urlkey":"christianmin","name":"Christian Ministry","id":6623},{"urlkey":"christiansocial","name":"Christian Social","id":10187},{"urlkey":"christian-discussion","name":"Christian Discussion","id":17612},{"urlkey":"christian","name":"Christian","id":17963},{"urlkey":"jesus-christ","name":"Jesus Christ","id":20589},{"urlkey":"small-groups-book-club-discuss-issues","name":"Small Groups - Book Club, Discuss Issues","id":21356},{"urlkey":"controversial-topic-discussions","name":"Controversial Topic Discussions","id":76309}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/studying-controversial-Christian-issues-by-the-Bible\/","rating":0,"description":"We discuss a range of issues related to Christianity about which there is much disagreement, and about which a lot of nonsense has been preached and published.

Not part-time, not as a hobby, not as a source of quick \"money on the side\" with several months in between doing something else. It's our full-time job, or truly augments it (for example, some talented individuals do equal amounts of stage\/film\/TV as well as VO work ). If this sounds like you, we welcome seeing your application!<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>If you're \"new to the biz\", or \"just looking to get into voiceover\/voice acting\", or simply want to \"kick the tires\" or \"try things out\" to learn more about the trade and see if it's right for you - unfortunately this group isn't designed for you.

We have a large email list, completely separate from this website, and get about 5 to 10 people per meeting just from that.<span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Anyway, most importantly, this group is commitment-free. Some of our members attend nearly every meeting; others show up once a month or even once a year. The main rule is to bring something to work on for the first hour. No assignments. No prompts. It's just a solid chunk of quiet time that you can use however you want. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> After the writing, there's a short break, and then we gather a little closer to take turns introducing ourselves. After that, we spend another hour or so doing an informal reading of our work. No one is ever forced to read -- that's not our style -- so at any given meeting, about half the people might end up sharing something. Some people read stuff they've been working on for a while. Others read what they've written during the hour. There's n<\/span><\/span>o need to bring copies because we read aloud. Each person gets eight minutes, which includes time for others to offer feedback, so we keep things moving at a pretty good pace.&nbsp;<span><br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> People in this group have written and shared all kinds of stuff:&nbsp;novels,&nbsp;short stories,&nbsp;journal and diary entries,&nbsp;poems,&nbsp;personal essays,&nbsp;memoirs, plays, screenplays,&nbsp;articles, dialogues, outlines, limericks, newsletters, blogs, kids books, science fiction, erotica, comedy, book proposals, cartoon strips, horoscopes, wedding speeches, eulogies, and song lyrics. Anything goes, and the same is true for your writing experience. You don't have to be published or submit samples in order to join. The purpose is to have a varied crowd and a relaxed setting where we actually do some writing and have a chance to hang out and meet fellow writers, and since people often ask, we're mostly in our 20s and 30s. <span> <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> We get together every week or two. There's no regular location because we usually meet in people's homes all over the place. (If you can host, please speak up!) Twice a year, we meet at a big, antiquarian bookstore in midtown. In warmer months, we meet semi-regularly in Central Park and other outdoor spots. We've even taken a few road trips as a group,&nbsp;<\/span>but we almost always stay within MetroCard range. Once per month (ish),&nbsp;we meet on weekend afternoons, but we usually do our thing on weeknights from 7:00 until about 10:30pm. People are welcome to show up late or leave early, so don't worry if these times aren't ideal. Can't make it for the writing hour? No problem. Come after that and check out the readings. <span> <br> <\/span> <span> <br> <\/span> <span>We don't have a set schedule. Some people are never free on Mondays, for example, while others can never make it on weekends, so we meet on different days of the week to accommodate everyone.<\/span> <br> <span><span> <br> <\/span> Finally, this group has always been free (and will remain so for people who are already part of it), but because of the cost of advertising on Meetup, there's a suggested donation of $1 -- not per meeting, but just at the first one you attend. <br> <\/span> <span><span> <br> <\/span> That's it.

you like to accurately learn and play the music of the Grateful Dead?\u00a0 At each session, participants will learn two or three songs with song specific soloing strategies and extensive jamming.\u00a0 Each session is two and a half hours.\u00a0 Each session is limited to six participants.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of these workshops is for individuals to express their developing concepts and performance skills in an organized context through the use of charts that demonstrate specific song forms, soloing strategies that are song specific, and learning techniques that utilize modern technology.\u00a0 Additionally, the workshop will foster stronger group cohesion, rhythmic synchronization, and group groove.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I have been coordinating a Grateful Dead Song and Jam group since 2010. \u00a0The same group of people have been getting together monthly to play and celebrate the music of the Grateful Dead. \u00a0These sessions are a lot of fun. \u00a0Now, through Meet Up.com, I'm looking to help more folks learn to play the music of the Grateful Dead with others.<\/p>\n<p>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/p>\n<p>This group is open to any and all instrumentalists and vocalists.\u00a0 Drums, bass, keys and guitarists learn to interlock and groove.\u00a0 Vocalists learn to place their melody into the wideness of the beat.\u00a0 Attention to detail is spent on tempos, grooves, and dynamics.\u00a0 Charts notate where in the beat the chords change. \u00a0Participants learn song specific soloing strategies to develop dramatically compelling solos.\u00a0 Refinement of details transforms an ordinary song rendition into the highest level playing experience.\u00a0<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The music of the Grateful Dead is a lot of fun to play solo and with others. \u00a0However, learning the music of the Grateful Dead can be problematic because there are many versions of any single song. \u00a0 \u00a0This is how I can help you learn. \u00a0This song and jam group is organized and structured so that participants actually learn the music the way the Grateful Dead played it. \u00a0The charts I use relate to specific studio and\/or live performances and function as default arrangements.\u00a0 I learned these parts from recordings and videos of band performances.\u00a0 The charts are clear about song form,\u00a0intros, \u00a0chord progressions, turnarounds, interludes and endings.\u00a0 Both Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir\u2019s parts will be taught. The charts demonstrate the correct rhythms, chord voicings, riffs and song form. In some cases, actual Phil Lesh bass lines have been transcribed. \u00a0The Grateful Dead, like many bands, shows that compositions may be flexible and improvisations may be structured.<\/p>\n<p>Note to budding song writers and improvisers - understanding song form helps one to better develop a dramatic arc, memorize songs more easily and improves one\u2019s ability to improvise and compose.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>WHAT YOU CAN LEARN:<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>As we learn each song, participants will learn the correct chord\u00a0progressions and song\u00a0forms; the actual chord voicings Jerry used;\u00a0the actual chord voicings Bob used;\u00a0specific chord progressions used during the improv sections;\u00a0pentatonic\/blues boxes for soloing;\u00a0chord\/scale combinations; Jerry's use of chromaticism; complicated ostinatos; inversion of guitar roles; use of triads; alternating triads as an improvisational tool; modal scales as an improvisational tool; variations on tone production through the use of hybrid picking; and rhythm guitar adaptations of keyboard parts using two and three-note voicings with palm muting techniques.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>As the group coordinator, I will discuss how to build solos and the group will jam on those songs.\u00a0 This is an opportunity to master your soloing skills.\u00a0 However, there is no obligation to improvise.\u00a0 There won\u2019t be any pressure to do so.\u00a0 People may simply strum along and enjoy that participation.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><span>Although actual songs that the group covers is at the coordinator's discretion, group suggestions play a big part. \u00a0In previous sessions we have learned and jammed on over 50 songs including: \u00a0<\/span><span>Alabama Getaway, Bertha, Big River, Birdsong, Black Muddy River, Brown Eyed Women, Casey Jones, China Cat Sunflower, Deal, El Paso, Eyes Of The World, Fire On The Mountain, Franklin's Tower, Friend Of The Devil, Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad, Good Lovin\u2019, I Know You Rider, Jack-A-Roe, Jackstraw, Johnny B.

Come to the one you like and find some new favorites too!<\/p> \n<p>We play modern (published in last 2 decades roughly) non-abstract strategy games.<\/p> \n<p>We include gateway strategy games\/euro games (e.g. Splendor, Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Dominion, Settlers of Catan), lighter games (e.g. King of Tokyo, Love Letter), cooperation games (e.g. Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Hanabi) and medium to heavier games (e.g. Twilight Imperium, A Game Of Thrones).

We host our own events and join other relevant events hosted by other groups.<\/p> \n<p>4. We work with other groups to foster an attitude of cooperation and collaboration.

However, we are not an advertising platform for your product or business. Please do not use our group for sales or marketing in a broader sense. Such events and people who post them will be removed from the group at organizers' discretion. Please do not argue \"technically\", please think conscientiously.<\/p> \n<p>6. We are open to suggestions. Board\/card\/video game, art, film, movie, novel, comic book, sci-fi, science, history, costume, lecture, discussion, convention, festival, and any other related event ideas are welcome.<\/p> \n<p>7. Group is open to all ages, genders, personal statuses, as well as to all levels of interest. Most events are open to all; however, it is possible that some events, by nature, are intended for specific attendees (such as game tournament). While we cannot make every event for everyone, we try to organize a variety of events to provide a widely inclusive experience and opportunities for attendees to meet people with similar interests.<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheCityBoardCommunity\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheCityBoardCommunity<\/a><\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/6\/4\/highres_370167492.jpeg","photo_id":370167492,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/6\/4\/600_370167492.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/b\/6\/4\/thumb_370167492.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":21201541,"name":"Yuiko Zee","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/f\/2\/b\/highres_249423883.jpeg","photo_id":249423883,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/f\/2\/b\/member_249423883.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/f\/2\/b\/thumb_249423883.jpeg"}},"members":1199,"name":"-The City Board (boardgames NYC)","id":11587182,"state":"NY","urlname":"TheCityBoard","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1388226494000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"dogs","name":"Dogs","id":15067},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"family-friendly","name":"Family Friendly","id":22233},{"urlkey":"doge","name":"Doge","id":1472262},{"urlkey":"dogecoin","name":"Dogecoin","id":1472272}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Dogecoin-Community\/","rating":4.71,"description":"<p>Come meet fellow friendly shibes in person!
