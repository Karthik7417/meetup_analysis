Not only that, they are in debt. A good portion of the working classes\u2019 income goes to paying all sorts of loans from mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and student loans. People are approached everyday to get new credit cards or refinance their mortgage. They are asked to SPEND rather than SAVE. Despite enjoying the biggest per capita income in the world, our BIGGEST PROBLEM IS MONEY.<\/p>\n<p>For those who save, they put money in savings accounts that pay too little to offset inflation and taxes. In fact, THEY\u2019RE LOSING THEIR MONEY!<\/p>\n<p>For those who invest, they put money into RISKY investment vehicles. Most people buy stock by the recommendation of friends and coworkers. They also put money into their pension in the company they work for and trust that it will be there when they retire.

That is NOT CONSIDERING the looming problem of health care costs and long-term care in old age.<\/p>\n<p>The BIGGEST CRISIS we\u2019re facing is not terrorism, global warming, or political stalemate.

BPD is a stressful condition that causes great pain in the sufferer as well as the people who are closest to him\/her. Until recently, there's been a tendency for professionals to blame parents for their children's disorder, which further burdens family members. Parents need to find ways to maintain their equilibrium in order to help their struggling children. Partners and spouses of people with borderline personality often question whether they should stay in their relationships. Children whose parents have this disorder have complicated issues that carry over into adulthood. We're hoping to share our experiences with other people who've 'been there' and to find ways to live more fully and more peacefully.","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":101032892,"name":"Leslie K Deutsch","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/highres_246559399.jpeg","photo_id":246559399,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/member_246559399.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/b\/c\/7\/thumb_246559399.jpeg"}},"members":75,"name":"Family and Friends \/ Borderline Personality Disorder","id":18632271,"state":"NY","urlname":"Family-and-Friends-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Meetup","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Port Washington","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1432841064000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"yoga","name":"Yoga","id":244},{"urlkey":"kayaking","name":"Kayaking","id":590},{"urlkey":"surfing","name":"Surfing","id":1428},{"urlkey":"beach","name":"Beach","id":10567},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"adventure","name":"Adventure","id":15892},{"urlkey":"water-sports","name":"Water Sports","id":17437},{"urlkey":"stand-up-paddle-boarding","name":"Stand Up Paddle Boarding","id":18488},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"beginners-surfing","name":"Beginners Surfing","id":27752},{"urlkey":"surfers","name":"Surfers","id":86048},{"urlkey":"stand-up-paddle-sup-newbies","name":"Stand Up Paddle: SUP Newbies","id":100250}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Port-Washington-Stand-Up-Paddle-Boarding-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Kostal Paddle provides Stand Up Paddle Board Lessons, Yoga Classes, Rentals and\nTours along with Kayak Rentals to Port Washington located on the North Shore of Long Island.

He thoroughly enjoys playing at the various dog parks and dog runs&nbsp;in Manhattan Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Prospect Park and&nbsp;other dog-friendly venues in Brooklyn. &nbsp;We are&nbsp;constantly looking for new&nbsp;places to explore!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rusty doesn't care if his Beagle&nbsp;cousins are purebred or mixed breed... or if they live&nbsp;in Brooklyn or Lynbrook!&nbsp; He doesn't even care if his playmates look like him or not!&nbsp; He just&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;make friends, run free, play&nbsp;and have fun with&nbsp;like-minded canines... no matter how young, or how&nbsp;old, or what breed they may be!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: &nbsp;Membership in&nbsp;our&nbsp;Brooklyn Beagles Club is totally FREE, however, the Club's membership roster&nbsp;will be&nbsp;limited to no more than <b>50<\/b> \"ACTIVE\" Members for the following three reasons:<\/p>\n<p>1)&nbsp; MeetUp.com's monthly maintenance fees&nbsp;increase substantially for Groups with more than 50 Members.<\/p>\n<p>2)&nbsp; Since I personally absorb all the costs associated with keeping this Club's&nbsp;web site in operation (never asking any Member for any contributions to help defray those costs) it&nbsp;makes no economic sense to me to pay&nbsp;increased monthly fees&nbsp;for a Group of more than 50 Members, when we have <i>existing<\/i> Members who have NEVER attended a scheduled MeetUp event; who have NEVER posted a single&nbsp;comment on our web site; who have NEVER participated in any of our Discussion Forums; or who have NEVER uploaded any photographs onto&nbsp;their personalized Photo Albums (which&nbsp;they requested be created for them at the time they joined our Club!).<\/p>\n<p>3)&nbsp; Despite all of that, the reality is that having 50 or more canine Members attending a scheduled MeetUp event at one time becomes unmanageable in any of our typical venues and would be overwhelming for any non-Brooklyn Beagles Club dog owners and their dogs who may already be present at a particular public venue when we arrive as a Group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is no&nbsp;point in having more than 50 Members in&nbsp;a Group if&nbsp;many of those Members choose&nbsp;to remain \"inactive\".<\/p>\n<p>The&nbsp;only reason this Club exists is to offer our canine kids&nbsp;periodic breaks from the monotony of living in an urban environment with very few outlets for them to be what nature intended them to be!&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, Member participation is crucial... or there is no reason to have a Club like this in the first place!<\/p>\n<p>I think you will agree that our&nbsp;pooches would benefit more from having a small group of ACTIVE Members, than a large group of NON-ACTIVE Members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So what constitutes&nbsp;an \"ACTIVE\" Member?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Member is considered to be \"ACTIVE\" if, within the past&nbsp;6 months, he\/she:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has attended at least ONE scheduled MeetUp Event; or...<\/p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has uploaded one or more photos into&nbsp;his\/her Photo Album (if a personalized Photo Album was created&nbsp;at his\/her request); or...<\/p>\n<p>3)&nbsp; Has posted a comment in any of our Discussion Forums; or...<\/p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has responded with an \"RSVP\" to a scheduled MeetUp event (even if he\/she indicates that he\/she cannot attend the scheduled MeetUp event); or...<\/p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Has&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;his\/her intent to&nbsp;become an active Member of the Club in the near future, either via an Email, a Club Post or a Club Message.<\/p>\n<p>Once our membership has reached 50 Members, new requests to join&nbsp;the Brooklyn Beagles&nbsp;Club will be held \"in queue\" until an existing Member either elects to leave the Club, or is removed from the Club's membership roster due to continual non-participation, inactivity or obvious loss of interest&nbsp;during the previous 6 months, as&nbsp;stipulated above.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: &nbsp;The Brooklyn Beagles Club reserves the right to remove any NON-ACTIVE Member (as defined above) at any time and without any prior, or subsequent notice, in order to&nbsp;make room&nbsp;for a new&nbsp;Member requesting to join the Club... thus preserving the maximum number of 50 Members.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Member contributions&nbsp;will NOT be accepted in this \"not-for-profit\" Club, so&nbsp;you will NOT find&nbsp;the \"Chip in\" icon on&nbsp;our MeetUp.com website.&nbsp; We have nothing to sell.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;NEVER ask you for money.&nbsp; We have no secret agendas!!<\/p>\n<p>If you request that a FREE Photo Album be created exclusively for you when you join, PLEASE upload at least&nbsp;one or two photos so that your fellow Members can admire&nbsp;your canine kid(s)&nbsp;too!&nbsp; It's very simple to do and it only takes a minute or two of your time.<\/p>\n<p>Your&nbsp;personalized&nbsp;Photo Album&nbsp;is located on our Club's \"Photos\" section.&nbsp; Simply respond to&nbsp;the first three&nbsp;very short Member Profile questions when you request to join&nbsp;our Club so that we may have the details we need to create your customized Photo Album. &nbsp;You can then upload as many photos onto it as you like!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you'd rather not have a personalized Photo Album created for you, that's OK too! &nbsp;Just indicate your preference&nbsp;at the time that you request to join.<\/p>\n<p>If distance makes it difficult (or impossible) for you to&nbsp;attend any&nbsp;of our MeetUps, we can all still benefit&nbsp;from your participation in our Discussion Forums&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;our collective&nbsp;canine wisdom for the benefit of our canine kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what this Club is all about!<\/p>\n<p>Our Club is unique in that our Members agree NOT to sue other Club Members for any potential liability claims resulting from their participation in a scheduled MeetUp event.&nbsp;

Unlike kayaking or paddle boarding, both which are fun but more solitary water sports, dragon boating has an added aspect of team building.&nbsp; The dragon boat is roughly 40 feet long with the capacity to hold 20 paddlers, a steersperson and a drummer. To move this boat quickly and efficiently those 20 paddlers must paddle in tandem in the same direction with the same goal.<\/p> \n<p>If you are interested please come out to our event and get the full dragon boat experience. As a women\u2019s team the coaching is tailored and adjusted to maximize the unique strengths that women can bring to the sport. We also encourage larger groups, such as professional teams and organizations who need a team building exercise to come out and join us for our \u201cOpen Boat\u201d day.<\/p> \n<p><b>What is provided:<\/b> Dragon boats, Paddles, PFD (Personal Floatation Device), Coaching\/ instruction, storage for small bags and keys<\/p> \n<p><b>Please wear<\/b>: temperature appropriate (remember most days the sun is beating down on us) clothing that is either dry- fit or fast drying. Please do not wear heavy materials (denim) or cotton as they are liable to get waterlogged and uncomfortable very quickly. A hat. Sunglasses. Sunscreen. Water resistant shoes (flip flops are fine)<\/p> \n<p><b>Please bring<\/b>: A bottle of water (you will need to hydrate). A change of clothing (in the case that you do get wet)<\/p> \n<p><b>Women in Canoe<\/b> is a 501(c)3 sporting organization that was established in 2000 by women, for women to realize their full potential starting with a healthy lifestyle in a supportive environment centered around the sport of dragon boating. Inherently the sport fosters collaboration and teamwork (making a boat that is over 40 feet long and 500+ lbs, not including the paddlers, move is no small task). The team has since continued in its commitment to the community by following its mission to foster the well-being of women from all backgrounds and all ages. We are proud to be a reflection of our home base, Queens, in our diversity and fortunate enough to be&nbsp;multi-generational, as we value&nbsp;experience as much as exuberance.

I\u2019m interested in starting an educational Role Playing Game Club in the area. &nbsp;As a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ProfessionalGameMasterSociety.com\">Professional GameMaster Society<\/a>, I believe that RPGs are a wonderful pastime, and at the same time also can be a very creative teaching-learning experience as well. &nbsp;I started playing RPGs when I was a freshman in High School, and started GamesMastering in at that time, way back in 1978. &nbsp;So I have quite a bit of experience with creating fabulous adventures in the realm of the imagination and playing them out as wondrous Campaigns in the often astounding World of Elthos.&nbsp; I've run a number of educational RPG programs for kids in the area in the past, and would like to build on that foundation to create a truly unique and wonderfully creative educational experience for kids in the future. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Style of Play <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play fairy tale and medieval fantasy campaigns, with a bit of science fiction mixed in here and there, which makes it suitable for children as well as adults. &nbsp; I customize my game according to the age and interests of my Players. My emphasis has always been on the quality of the storyline, and the enjoyment of the players. My goal is to provide the Players a sense of team spirit, critical thinking, good sportsmanship, the benefits of investigation, planning, organization, and the perils and rewards associated with risk taking, determination, courage, and fair play. &nbsp;I will also be endeavoring, within the context of the game, to expose the players to certain educational materials, such as classical artwork and music (with brief discussions) as well as history, philosophy, and where applicable, science and math. &nbsp;This is all done in the frolicking world of Elthos where adventures involve battling giants and dragons, or exploring realms beyond the far reaches of the known world, depending on what the young heroes decide to do with their Characters in the game World. &nbsp;It\u2019s a truly fabulous way to learn!<\/p>\n<p><b>Elthos: The RPG System&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I created the first version of the Elthos RPG in 1978. It is a system of my own design based off of the original version of D&amp;D.&nbsp; In recent years I distilled down my original Elthos system to a much more efficient mini-system that makes for greater ease-of-play, and then went on to program the mini-system as an online application named <b>The Mythos Machine<\/b>.&nbsp; It serves to make my games highly efficient for both myself and my players. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Arrangements <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>I can either play via an online venue using Roll20 or similar Virtual Table Top software, or in person, depending on the preferences of the Players.&nbsp; For local in-person games, because there is an theatrical aspect to the playing of Role Playing Games, atmosphere is an important factor. &nbsp;Particularly lighting and the coziness of the play area makes a significant difference. &nbsp;A table for players to use as a writing surface is required as well as a table for the GameMaster. &nbsp; I would favor a consistent time and location for the games as that would make it easier on everyone for scheduling and transportation.&nbsp; I would run 1 game sessions per week for any given group of players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pricing&nbsp; <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p>$10.00 \/ Hour per Player (minimum of 6 players, maximum of 12) <br><\/p>\n<p><b>The Club Rules<\/b>&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Place and Time<\/i>: Games will be held on the Second and Fourth Sunday of each month at the specified time and location.<\/p>\n<p><i>Players<\/i>: &nbsp;There can be a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 club players during a given game. &nbsp;A Club Player Waiting List can be created if necessary. Elthos games are appropriate for young adults between the ages of 11 and 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Player Attendance<\/i>: Players who can not attend the game should contact the GM by email or cell phone to let the GM know that they won\u2019t be able to make it. They may at that time assign any character(s) that they have in the current game to be played either by the GM or another Player at their discretion. If no contact is made then the character(s) will be played at the GM\u2019s discretion. &nbsp;Players who do not show up for three consecutive games may have their position replaced by someone on the waiting list, and their Character may be assigned the status of \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (most players will understand what that means).<\/p>\n<p><i>Payment<\/i>: &nbsp;The club game fee will be collected on a per game basis at the standard rate, payable through the Meetup website.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p><i>Code of Conduct<\/i>: Players must behave in a polite manner toward other Players and the GM at all times or they may be benched for the game. Good sportsmanship will be emphasized. &nbsp;I'll do my best to take this club in the direction that the majority of members seem to want to go. I'll often ask for member input into various happenings in the club and I'll be receptive to ideas and criticisms by members regarding the club. However, if I find that a member is acting in such a way as to disrupt club activities or ruin other member's enjoyment of the event, that member will be dismissed from the Club.<\/p>\n<p><i>Arbitration\/Disputes<\/i>: &nbsp;The GM will arbitrate all game related disputes and those decisions must be considered final.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Well, let me know if this plan seems good to you, or if you have any suggestions. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing from you. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Sincerely Yours,<\/p>\n<p>Mark Abrams,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/111193673863924049303\/about\">Professional GameMaster Profile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>of<a href=\"http:\/\/professionalgamemastersociety.com\/\"> The Professional GameMaster Society<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/f\/9\/600_438276857.jpeg\"><\/p>","lon":-73.7799987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/9\/b\/highres_444322427.jpeg","photo_id":444322427,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/9\/b\/600_444322427.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/9\/b\/thumb_444322427.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":2428395,"name":"Mark","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/c\/2\/highres_163238082.jpeg","photo_id":163238082,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/c\/2\/member_163238082.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/c\/2\/thumb_163238082.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Elthos Game Club","id":18650124,"state":"NY","urlname":"Elthos-Game-Club","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":41.0499992371,"who":"Elthosians"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433510361000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"marketing","name":"Marketing","id":1238},{"urlkey":"business","name":"Business","id":10575},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"small-business-marketing-strategy","name":"Small Business Marketing Strategy","id":17325},{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"executive-coaching","name":"Executive Coaching","id":135717}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Small-Business-Strategy-Meetup\/","rating":4.79,"description":"Every 2 weeks we will meet to discuss problems that plague business owners.

To help you with this, I'll teach you the art of joriki, a Zen term for illuminating the light or spirit within and blending with the light of the source or spirit without.

This meetup is designed for anyone who is suffering from any variety of health issues. This can range anywhere from chronic headaches, to visual disturbances, to depersonalization, and anything else that you may be seeking an answer for. This group is meant to be a support system and a place where we can share our experiences and offer suggestions on things we\u2019ve tried that might help others. Topics I hope to cover include conventional treatments, alternative therapies, nutritional health, and spiritual health. The goal is to heal as completely as possible. In addition, I hope to plan fun things for us to be able to do as a group. <\/p>\n<p>A little about me: <\/p>\n<p>My name is Alan and for 14 years, I was suffering from a number of health issues. This included chronic headaches, dizziness, anxiety, digestion issues, cognitive issue, insomnia, visual issues, and TMJ issues, just to name a few. I was also experiencing this pervasive feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right, although I could never pinpoint what it was. I spent many years trying all kinds of treatments and therapies to no avail. I\u2019ve been to every type of doctor out there and tried every alternative, nutritional, and spiritual remedy imaginable. A little over a year ago, I finally came across a therapy that has helped me tremendously. I\u2019ve finally been able to overcome most of what I was experiencing. The hardest part throughout everything was never having anyone to talk to. I know how hard and lonely the journey can be, and wanted to create a group where anyone and everyone who might be going through their own ordeal can turn to for support. <\/p>\n<p>My hope is that we can become a family that grows together, and ultimately have an impact on each other\u2019s journeys.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":186351000,"name":"Alan","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/highres_247313427.jpeg","photo_id":247313427,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/member_247313427.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/0\/b\/3\/thumb_247313427.jpeg"}},"members":60,"name":"Headaches, dizziness, anxiety and this thing I cant explain","id":18656568,"state":"NY","urlname":"thisthingicantexplain","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Wanaque","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433737416000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pagan","name":"Pagan","id":486},{"urlkey":"asatru","name":"Asatru","id":770},{"urlkey":"metaphysics","name":"Metaphysics","id":774},{"urlkey":"goddess","name":"Goddess","id":1052},{"urlkey":"shamanism","name":"Shamanism","id":1254},{"urlkey":"drumcircle","name":"Drum Circle","id":2278},{"urlkey":"wiccan","name":"Wiccan","id":3862},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"heathen","name":"Heathen","id":15102},{"urlkey":"pagan-social","name":"Pagan Social","id":32452},{"urlkey":"earth-based-spirituality","name":"Earth-Based Spirituality","id":37479},{"urlkey":"everything-witchcraft","name":"Witchcraft","id":74176},{"urlkey":"norse-paganism","name":"Norse Paganism","id":89546},{"urlkey":"heathenry-or-heathenism-or-heathens","name":"Heathenry or Heathenism or Heathens","id":102841},{"urlkey":"summer-solstice","name":"Summer Solstice","id":107023}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Pagans\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>New Jersey Pagans is the Largest Online and Offline Community in NJ We have been serving the community for over 15 yrs.

We are a running group supporting runners who are dealing with an injury or coming back to running after an injury.<\/p>\n<p> I know you don't want to be here... who would want to be injured instead of being out there running? Nobody! Unfortunately, the majority of the runners get injured at some point in their running career. I've got injured right after I started running 7 years ago. My Achilles tendon gave up on me. I was in a walking boot for&nbsp;several months followed by countless hours of PT sessions. It was painful, it was boring, and I felt shunned. I could not RUN!&nbsp;But in a way I was lucky. I met a girl who was a runner and&nbsp;injured as well. She had a stress fracture and she couldn't RUN either. We started to hang out and talk about our injuries, walk in Central Park instead of run,&nbsp;we discussed treatment options, our progress&nbsp;and plans after recovery. This was such a powerful bond between us: we are still best friends since and we are both recovered and running happy these days.<\/p>\n<p>You might want to find a similar place, or a friend who you can talk to about your injury and running and what the future holds for you. This is why this Meetup group was created. We welcome you here and we don't judge you. We understand that you are frustrated because of your injury and inability to do what you love the most: <strong>RUN<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to meet weekly and support each other. We can have discussions in a caf\u00e9 or we can have a slow stroll in the park. Whatever works! Come out, let's support each other in the recovery process, and before you know it, you will be back again&nbsp;in the park running!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edina<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founder of BIBSWITCH<\/p>\n<p><strong>BIBSWITCH<\/strong> - is an online platform that facilitates race number transfers between race organizers and runners who can no longer participate in an event they signed up for&nbsp;in advance.

The size of Lavender Space Yoga classes are usually 10 yoga practitioners max. You will move and breath in carefully curated music.

Outside of yoga, I have a full time job that I love and a supportive group of love ones. On most days, I am happy, but just like everyone who lives in this city, the pressure of the daily life can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to manage. Through the regular practicing of yoga, I frequently discover new ways to keep my life balance, maintain self control and create more space to care for others; and I want to share the practice with you. Teaching and practicing yoga are my hobbies so some weeks, I might not have any class if other priorities take over. When that happens, I usually find a guest instructor to lead the class, or not schedule one. Don't let that stop you from your personal practice. Let this group compliments whatever practice you already have (or help you start one if you are new to yoga). Reserve your sport today and try it out!<\/p>","lon":-74.0299987793,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/highres_438570892.jpeg","photo_id":438570892,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/600_438570892.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/8\/a\/c\/thumb_438570892.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9323786,"name":"Linh Lanh","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/highres_247003866.jpeg","photo_id":247003866,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/member_247003866.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/b\/5\/a\/thumb_247003866.jpeg"}},"members":169,"name":"Lavender Space Yoga Afterwork","id":18659774,"state":"NJ","urlname":"LavenderSpace","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Yoga practitioners"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bloomfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433836882000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"young-business-professionals","name":"Young Business Professionals","id":15530},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"networking-happy-hour","name":"Networking Happy Hour","id":46030},{"urlkey":"young-professional-women","name":"Young Professional Women","id":52083},{"urlkey":"young-professional-singles","name":"Young Professional Singles","id":58259},{"urlkey":"young-professional-networking","name":"Young Professional Networking","id":79058}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Jersey-Young-Professionals-Meet-and-Mingle\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>This is a group for young professionals interested in networking in a local, fun environment.

I look forward to having NYC gamers and geeks over for some beers and gaming action.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/highres_438476731.jpeg","photo_id":438476731,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/600_438476731.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/d\/9\/b\/thumb_438476731.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":55522242,"name":"Chris Kooluris","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/highres_246893982.jpeg","photo_id":246893982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/member_246893982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/2\/d\/e\/thumb_246893982.jpeg"}},"members":195,"name":"New York Classic Arcade Games Meetup","id":18660166,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-classic-arcade-games-Meetup","category":{"name":"games","id":11,"shortname":"games"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Gaming Geeks"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Westfield","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433848781000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"family-and-friends","name":"Family and Friends","id":16929},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westfield-Playdates-Meetup-85266452inzdAFAs\/","rating":0,"description":"Fun play dates with our kids around the Westfield Area","lon":-74.3499984741,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/highres_438707055.jpeg","photo_id":438707055,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/600_438707055.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/7\/c\/f\/thumb_438707055.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":85266452,"name":"barbara frankowicz","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/highres_244098679.jpeg","photo_id":244098679,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/member_244098679.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/8\/f\/7\/thumb_244098679.jpeg"}},"members":49,"name":"Westfield Playdates Meetup","id":18660194,"state":"NJ","urlname":"Westfield-Playdates-Meetup-85266452inzdAFAs","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.6500015259,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New Brunswick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433860979000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"spoken-word","name":"Spoken Word","id":15191},{"urlkey":"literature","name":"Literature","id":15321},{"urlkey":"readers","name":"Readers","id":17219},{"urlkey":"literary-events","name":"Literary Events","id":18166},{"urlkey":"poetic-readings","name":"Poetic Readings","id":20335},{"urlkey":"open-mic","name":"Open Mic","id":26103},{"urlkey":"womens-book-club","name":"Women's Book Club","id":26397},{"urlkey":"academia","name":"Academia","id":28269},{"urlkey":"prose-and-poetry","name":"Prose and Poetry","id":28832},{"urlkey":"academics","name":"Academics","id":32773},{"urlkey":"poets","name":"Poets","id":33467},{"urlkey":"poetry-readings","name":"Poetry Readings","id":44304}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rutgers-Summer-Session-Author-Reading-Events\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>The Rutgers-New Brunswick&nbsp;Office of Summer and Winter Session sponsors author reading events during the Summer and Winter Sessions.

It is not simply acquiring business cards and adding names to your \u201cLinkedIn\u201d account \u2013 it is taking the time to getting to know people in the areas in which you are interested or want to learn more about and staying in touch with them throughout your career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2.

Create a platform to practice the soft skills in a conversational and friendly setting. Most of us know our weaknesses, whether we need to be more organized or do a better job of meeting deadlines or simply prioritizing in a smarter way.

Or maybe you're an experienced meditater and are looking for a group of like-minded seekers to meditate with? Join us every Monday as we dive into the deeper teachings, then sit together for 45 minutes utilizing a myriad of meditation techniques that you can then utilize at home. No experience necessary! We offer a supportive community of new and experienced meditaters with the intention of diving deeper into the practice. Meditation is a journey of self-discovery. By making the mind calm and quiet, we can go deep within and discover who we really are. By doing so, we find lasting peace and happiness and learn how to effectively solve our life-problems and realize our highest aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>All meditations are meant to purify our heart and bring our mind to its natural condition. Our consciousness is inherently pure, eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. But somehow or other it has been covered by and adulterated by so many misconceptions, so many desires, so many longings, so many anxieties about what we want and what we don\u2019t want.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you look into a mirror, you see yourself. But what if that mirror has been neglected for hundreds of years? There are layers and layers of debris, dust, dirt and filth. And when you look into that mirror, all you see is the dust and the dirt that is accumulated, and all that you think is \u201cThis is me!\u201d But when you clean the mirror, little by little you start seeing the image of yourself. And when the mirror is actually clean, you see who you are. Meditation is for that purpose; prayers are for that purpose; spirituality is for that purpose: to cleanse our heart, to cleanse our life-style so that we can actually directly experience our own essence, which is eternal, full of knowledge and full of love<\/p>\n<br>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/highres_438500682.jpeg","photo_id":438500682,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/600_438500682.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/c\/a\/thumb_438500682.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":91531402,"name":"Dhyana","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/highres_246924137.jpeg","photo_id":246924137,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/member_246924137.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/e\/4\/9\/thumb_246924137.jpeg"}},"members":321,"name":"Meditation & Kirtan: For New and Experienced - LES\/E.Village","id":18662790,"state":"NY","urlname":"meditation-group-LES","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Meditaters, Yogis, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1433942491000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"advertising","name":"Advertising","id":690},{"urlkey":"social-media","name":"Social Media","id":15401},{"urlkey":"online-marketing","name":"Online Marketing","id":15585},{"urlkey":"digital-media","name":"Digital Media","id":17188},{"urlkey":"social-media-marketing","name":"Social Media Marketing","id":17742},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing","name":"Digital Marketing","id":22773},{"urlkey":"social-media-for-business","name":"Social Media for Business","id":37708},{"urlkey":"learn-social-media-marketing","name":"Learn Social Media Marketing","id":80837},{"urlkey":"digital-marketing-analytics","name":"Digital Marketing Analytics","id":785142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Snapchat-Marketing-in-New-York\/","rating":5,"description":"A place to come together and talk about Snapchat\u2122 marketing.

Our slogan is simple and it fits with our mission: \"We Educate to Elevate Women in Business.\" We believe that TRAINING is the key to success for most women in business. However, most entrepreneurs do not take the time out to get the training that they need to take their businesses to the next level. The Network for Women in Business help business owners by providing them with the most up-to-date and cutting-edge training in all aspects and areas of business. It doesn't matter if you're a solo-preneur or an entrepreneur running a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees or a home-based business owner, we have something for you.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>We are gearing up to be the premiere site for training women in business in all aspects of business from getting started, writing business plans, to developing a social media strategy or PR strategy. Within no time at all, the Network for Women in Business site will be filled with an archive of training unlike any other. It will be the place you come back to over and over again, not only for the training but also for the CONNECTIONS that you will be able to make with our members. When we launched our Facebook page on December 15, 2011, we had no idea that by the 28th of the same month that we would have over 2,000 Fans! Our official launch is slated for the 15th of January 2012. By the time that date comes, we anticipate that we will be very close to having 5,000 Facebook Fans, which should easily translate into a very active membership base.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Premium membership allows our members and their businesses to be highlighted in our member directory for the world to see. This will allow members to connect with the right people to help them grow. Members will be able to ADVANCE their businesses.

This wonderful, powerful healing modality is practiced by a fairly decent number of healers in the U.S., but it seems not yet strongly represented on the East Coast. We, the organizers (Sharon and Louisa) are very passionate about Angelic Reiki and feel that Spirit is pushing us to spread the word, so that in a few years' time, Angelic Reiki will be well known to the metaphysical community. We especially want to reach out to those practicing other forms of energy healing and assure these healers that whatever form of healing you're already doing, that healing and Angelic Reiki are not mutually exclusive. So, for example, If you are a healer and practice Usui Reiki, you SHOULD learn Angelic Reiki so that you can add it to your arsenal. This is not about a competition!!! This is about spreading more Angelic love and influence.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":188293811,"name":"Sharonel69","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/highres_252226451.jpeg","photo_id":252226451,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/member_252226451.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/5\/7\/3\/thumb_252226451.jpeg"}},"members":69,"name":"Angelic Reiki Healing Meetup","id":18673371,"state":"NY","urlname":"Angelic-Reiki-Healing-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Woodbridge","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434339624000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Woodbridge-Walkers-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>This group is for anyone who is looking for walking buddies!

Early Russian cosmists proposed the idea of technological decompaction\/lightweighting of human body, which eventually wouldn\u2019t need an atmosphere and will be powered directly by solar energy. They call it \u201cradiant humanity\u201d - perfect society of highly moral and super-conscious beings merging and colonizing the whole Universe. <\/p> \n<p>Modern Cosmism brining to this doctrine ontological foundation, scientific structure and comprehension of possible technology. It's suggested that the profound nature of the reality is digital and it utilizes&nbsp; existential source code coming from Being which are using \u201cradiant humanity\u201d for its preserving and modification.&nbsp; Thus, we consider (for example) that Cosmological constant and precondition of Big Bang singularity were informationaly favorable mean guided. <\/p> \n<p>Cosmism will \u201cwork closely together\u201d with Transhumanism&nbsp; on transition period until consciousness uploading&nbsp; become possible. Then most likely humanity will be divided in two main directions: Earth base genetically improved biological civilization and departing digital society, creating new cosmic reality where the concepts of truth, consciousness, freedom and happiness will be deeply revised.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/highres_439015680.jpeg","photo_id":439015680,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/600_439015680.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/9\/8\/0\/thumb_439015680.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":176456192,"name":"Vlad Bowen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/highres_245249871.jpeg","photo_id":245249871,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/member_245249871.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/4\/a\/f\/thumb_245249871.jpeg"}},"members":70,"name":"Cosmism Meetup","id":18678518,"state":"NY","urlname":"Cosmism-Meetup","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1434549197000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"retire","name":"Retirement Planning","id":10026},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"financial-planning","name":"Financial Planning","id":15222},{"urlkey":"money","name":"Money","id":15580},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"retirees","name":"Retirees","id":20689},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"self-empowerment","name":"Self-Empowerment","id":38757},{"urlkey":"retired-men-and-women","name":"Retired Men and Women","id":49065}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Wealth-Builders\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>Welcome to New York Wealth Builder!<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Are you worried that you will never achieve financial independence?<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you spend more time planning your next vacation instead of your financial future?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Does thinking about your financial future cause you anxiety?&nbsp;<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i> <br><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Do you look at your parents and tell yourself you better start planning now?&nbsp; <\/i><\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Most people do, which is why I wrote How to Avoid Bag Lady Syndrome: A Strong Woman's Guide to Financial Peace of Mind to help individuals achieve financial independence and take control of their financial world at an earlier stage in life.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>We plan to meet once a month to discuss any financial concerns or matters that are important to the group as a whole.

It's about recognizing all bodies as valid, good, and worthy of love and acceptance. It's about standing up against bullying, body shaming, and fat shaming. And of course we reject society's beauty standards telling us how we're supposed to look! <br>What is naturism? Naturism is the practice of going naked in a non-sexual environment, but for myself and many others, it's also based on a philosophy of acceptance and respect. Naturists believe the human body should be celebrated, and we reject the idea that the body is shameful, dirty or obscene. Naturism fosters positive body image and self-esteem, and has other social &amp; psychological benefits. Naturists also live in harmony with nature and respect the environment. <br>With all the issues surrounding the female body, such as slut-shaming &amp; victim-blaming, street harassment, sexual objectification, beauty standards, sexism and so on, women especially need safe spaces where we can reclaim our bodies, band together and support one another! <br>In this group, we will: <br>\u2022 Attend lectures &amp; events related to body image \/ acceptance <br>\u2022 Engage in body positive activism <br>\u2022 Have clothing-optional and topfree (topless) social meetups <br>\u2022 Go on outdoor excursions like topfree hiking and skinny dipping <br>\u2022 And we're open to suggestions! <br>This group is open to women of all ages and trans women as well.

While sitting at a table at the bar I overheard the friend talking about his girlfriend saying \"Girls just can't understand finance.\" Of course I chimed in and said WTF?! are you joking me?? OBVI if i had studied finance in college, then I would be sick at finance.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, after this conversation, I realized that I would like to learn more about this predominantly male-driven field that our entire society is so dependent on.

BUT a Union Actor standing next to you gets \"WET\" pay. Others do not. And I don't think that's fair. Same goes for Meal Penalties. They are not applied to the NON Union workers and that also is not far. Also as a sole proprietor on set NON Union have no say in there rates\/wages for work. That also is Unfair.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Our Short Term goal as of now is not to UNIONIZE but to Stand United.

When we were evolved from Amoeba to humans, we were not aware of it. In order to evolve from human beings to pure joy and pure spirits, the all-pervading power wants us to realize the transformation. The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\".&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:<\/p>\n<p>1. It is Free of Charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>2. It is simple and easy.<\/p>\n<p>Do not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Anyone can do it.<\/p>\n<p>Just need pure desire in your heart and it starts flowing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4.

The St. Regis, the Peninsula, the Parker Meridien, the Four Seasons, the Plaza, the Ritz-Carlton, the Mandarin Oriental.

In fact, since 1985, BNI members worldwide have exchanged over 15 Million business referrals, totaling over $8 Billion in new business.  In BNI, only one person per profession may join a local chapter.  And that means once you join us, you have completely locked out your competition.  However, if your competition joins first, the opportunity is gone. BNI is category exclusive, so once you join, you will not be competing with someone in the same profession for referrals.  If you consider networking and\/or referrals to be an important part of new business development for your business, BNI represents a high-value opportunity for you.\n\nAs a reminder here's why we wake up early Wednesday mornings. 98% of businesses rely on referrals to build new business. ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Networking requires commitment. The most successful chapters of BNI are comprised of participants who are sincerely committed to helping one another through networking. They are a team. As a participant in BNI, you are responsible for complying with the policies and guidelines of the organization.","lon":-73.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":13744230,"name":"Joe Vaccarelli","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/highres_250343622.jpeg","photo_id":250343622,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/member_250343622.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/c\/4\/6\/thumb_250343622.jpeg"}},"members":19,"name":"BNI Chapter 61","id":18701485,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Chapter-61","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7900009155,"who":"Power Networkers"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435417153000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"edtech","name":"Education & Technology","id":7203},{"urlkey":"communityorg","name":"Community Organizations","id":10485},{"urlkey":"community-service","name":"Community Service","id":18866},{"urlkey":"community-outreach","name":"Community Outreach","id":19164},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"community-gardening","name":"Community Gardening","id":74771},{"urlkey":"food-and-drink","name":"Food and Drink","id":87548}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Consciousness-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in food advocacy and promoting fairness across the board including supermarkets, restaurants, bars and even food trucks.

This Meetup group provides adults 50+ with the opportunities to meet and mingle with others from the New York tri-state area during casual and extremely low-pressure events. Some events we have put on in the past are \u201cSpeed-Meeting\u201d events, movie screenings, coffee get-togethers, and more. We welcome anyone 50 and older, who is looking for any type of companionship, to join, and strongly encourage future Meetup suggestions and ideas!<\/p>\n<p>What is Stitch.net?<br>Stitch.net is an online service, which helps adults 50 years and over find the companionship they are looking for. For some people this might be a romantic partner, for others it could be just a friend who likes partaking in the same activities. Stitch recognizes that there are many different types of companionship, and that the need for companionship doesn\u2019t go away as we get older. You can read more about Stitch.net on Stitch.net\u2019s FAQ page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.stitch.net\/FAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please Note:<br>-Even though we highly recommend it, you will never be required or pressured to join Stitch.net\u2019s online services, and will never be required to be on Stitch.net to attend an event going forward.<\/p>\n<p>-Some of the RSVPs for our events will be done through a different website other than Meetup when we have to limit the number of attendees. Due to all of Stitch.net\u2019s members not being on Meetup, we believe this is the most fair way to RSVP for these types of events.

To fulfill this aim we have created a peaceful city sanctuary located in the heart of Chelsea. Based on the books of the modern day Buddhist teacher, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, we present Buddha\u2019s teachings in an accessible manner that can easily be integrated into our modern lives.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>Established over twenty years ago, hundreds of New Yorkers currently participate in our programs at the main center and throughout the city. The Center is run by volunteers who themselves are dedicated practitioners, and we have a warm and welcoming community. Please feel free to drop in for a visit. During opening hours there is always someone at hand who can answer your questions. In addition to the beautiful meditation room, you can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/bookstore-giftshop\/\">bookstore and gift shop<\/a>, or just spend time in our comfortable sitting and reading area. (Reference materials are available.)<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to participate in the activities at the center, we recommend that you begin with one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/study-programs\/general-program-classes\/\">General Program classes<\/a>. The evening classes on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/mondays-intro-class\/\">Mondays<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/thursday-meditation-class-2\/\">Thursdays<\/a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/sunday-morning-meditation-class\/\">Sunday morning<\/a>&nbsp;classes are suitable for newcomers.

Taught by qualified Western teachers, the meditation classes and Buddhist philosophy are very easy to understand and apply to our daily lives. The classes are suitable for both beginners and more advanced practitioners, and emphasize how to meditate and practice in our NY urban environment. <br><\/p>\n<p>More information can be found on our website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/meditationinnewyork.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/9\/d\/4\/600_439887092.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/highres_439837262.jpeg","photo_id":439837262,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/600_439837262.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/1\/8\/e\/thumb_439837262.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":189398249,"name":"Diane Hill","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/highres_248057652.jpeg","photo_id":248057652,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/member_248057652.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/4\/f\/4\/thumb_248057652.jpeg"}},"members":85,"name":"Kadampa Meditation Center NYC Meetup","id":18715176,"state":"NY","urlname":"Kadampa-Meditation-Center-NYC-Meetup","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Students"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Staten Island","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1435875676000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"gay","name":"Gay","id":447},{"urlkey":"Lesbian","name":"Lesbian","id":742},{"urlkey":"gaycouples","name":"Gay Couples","id":4605},{"urlkey":"lgbtfriends","name":"LGBT","id":10050},{"urlkey":"gay-singles","name":"Gay Singles","id":15196},{"urlkey":"gay-and-lesbian-friends","name":"Gay and Lesbian Friends","id":16464},{"urlkey":"lgbt-social-group","name":"LGBT Social Group","id":17665},{"urlkey":"gay-men","name":"Gay Men","id":19558},{"urlkey":"lesbian-friends","name":"Lesbian Friends","id":21736},{"urlkey":"friends-supporters-of-lgbt-glbt","name":"Friends & Supporters of LGBT\/GLBT","id":27521},{"urlkey":"lesbian-social-networking","name":"Lesbian Social Networking","id":36427},{"urlkey":"lgbtq","name":"LGBTQ","id":64804},{"urlkey":"lgbt-singles","name":"lgbt singles","id":66447}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Staten-Island-LGBTQ-Pride-Bowling-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>In partnership with the Pride Center of Staten Island, join your community for an of bowling and learn more about the Pride Center of Staten Island Fall Bowling League!

We also think that by removing clothes, we\u2019ll get rid of preconceived notions of how we are supposed to move according to the social status and social group associated with clothes; also, different dance styles are usually associated with different attire, whereas we want to give your body full freedom in motion and let you move the way you want irrespective of style. In other words, free your ass, and your mind will follow!<\/p>\n<p>The class is based on various street\/urban dance styles, such as hip-hop, breaking, krump, house, etc. Electronic music and various mixes will serve as the musical accompaniment for the class, to get your energy flowing and your heart pumping while you have fun, learn and get a great workout in the process! And while these styles may appear utterly modern, many moves and rhythms are traced back to tribal and folk origins. Thus nudity will only add that authentic, raw feel, as in many tropical cultures, as well as the cradle of European civilization, Ancient Greece, dance was often performed naked.<\/p>\n<p>And as a pleasant side effect, you\u2019ll probably learn the moves better than at any other (clothed) class, because you can\u2019t cheat your moves naked ;-)<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy this preview with our brilliant instructor damoN, and stay tuned for updates!

Our intention is to bring together some of the main esoteric streams and movements within the western hermetic tradition, under the apophthegm of the Rosicrucian ideal, as stated in the Fama and Confessio: a brotherhood, working in secrecy, focused on a sincere inner development of its members, thereby affecting the world at large, without any interest of financial gain. The name, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis &amp; Solis Alati, is in fact the name of two Orders; the first, Sodalitas Rosae+Crucis (S.R.C.), translates into 'The Secret Society of the Rosy Cross', thus representing the Rosicrucian flavour of the magical and mystical processes that lead the candidate to a full contact with his\/her Holy Guardian Angel. The second, Sodalitas Solis Alati (S.S.A.), which translates into \"The Secret Society of the Winged Sun\", indicates the alchemical work that the adept is then ready for. Within these two Orders, the magical work and initiations of the Golden Dawn, Alpha &amp; Omega and Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, the mystical work and initiations of Christian Theurgy and the alchemical work of the Royal Path integrates into a coherent system of personal unfoldment and development, where every step follows the next in a clear and consistent way. The purpose of the Order is the perpetuation and realization of the western Hermetic tradition in this new era. Our work is to bring forth the Light of our predecessors, our Mothers and Fathers in Gnosis, Who have perpetuated Truth through the traditions of the Rosicrucian Order, the Primitive Rites of the Egyptians, the Royal Art of the Alchemists, The Concealed Mysteries of the Kabbalists &amp; the Gnosis of our beloved Lady Sophia.

It's a mindset.&nbsp; It's the lost art of finding and creating opportunity. Instead of waiting for opportunities to float to the surface, break divers DIVE IN to the cold, icy, and treacherous shark-infested waters of resistance and find their 'chance of a lifetime' in the muddy bottom where no one else dares to tread. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHAT THIS MEETUP GROUP IS ABOUT: <br><\/b>The purpose of this Meetup group is to inspire members to pursue their dreams and find solutions to problems encountered along the way.&nbsp; Think of it as a gym membership for your life, offering engaging and inspiring meetups, seminars, and courses.&nbsp; This Meetup might also be considered life and business coaching in a fun group environment.&nbsp; Bottom line, studies have shown that we become the type of person we hang out with the most.&nbsp; So, come network, learn from, and be inspired by other winners just like you!&nbsp; . <br><\/p>\n<p><b>WHO SHOULD JOIN:<\/b> <br>If you have big dreams, great ambitions, and outlandish plans...

Since its launch in December 2008, Global Zero has grown to include 300 current and former heads of state, national security advisers, military commanders, and business, civic and faith leaders -- and nearly half a million citizens worldwide; developed a step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; built and international student movement with 170 campus chapters in 25 countries; and produced a documentary film,&nbsp;Countdown to Zero, with the Academy Award-winning team behind&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth.<\/p>\n<p>Nuclear weapons have no place in the 21st century. The ability to completely annihilate populations, infrastructure and the environment doesn't make us safer or more secure. They do not address today's security needs and siphon precious financial resources from the things that do. The threat of nuclear annihilation is real. 20 years after the end of the Cold War, 1,500 nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in minutes and wipe major cities off the map. Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately. They violate international humanitarian law, and do not make us safer. Any nuclear accident or attack would have catastrophic and irreversible consequences on the environment. Even a \"small\" regional nuclear exchange would cause a nuclear winter, which would cause a global famine, killing approximately 2 billion people. And every day, terrorists are working to build, buy or steal a nuclear weapon. In the last two decades there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. Those threats are real, and it's scary.<\/p>\n<p>Its members understand that the only way to eliminate the nuclear threat \u2013 including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, secure all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons: global zero. The movement combines cutting-edge policy development and direct dialogue with governments with public outreach, including media, online and grassroots initiatives to make the elimination of nuclear weapons an urgent global imperative.<\/p>\n<p>As residents of NYC, we have and continue to be a target of terrorism. But we can take action to avoid a nuclear weapons incident! There are no insurmountable technical barriers to global zero, nor are there financial ones. The only barrier is political: it's a matter of the leaders of the nuclear powers acting with urgency and resolve. It's our job to muster the necessary public pressure and political will to make that happen - with hundreds of world leaders, Global Zero's bold campaigning, and the power of our grassroots movement we know we can reach Zero.<\/p>\n<p>If you agree with me, or at the very least curious about what I'm talking about, I urge you to attend this very important conversation.

Do you want to be a part of a community that is social, and supportive? Then this group is for you. Learn to set your camera, and utilize it; learn to see light, and control it; and learn to pose models, before you click it. Just like driving a car it becomes second nature over time, but you must practice, practice, practice! <br><\/p>\n<p>What I learn I like to share with others, because it helps me become a better photographer. We can all learn from each other, share tips, and support each other in our efforts to become better photographers. If you don't try, you can't fail, and if you don't fail, you can't learn. Let's get together and make it happen! Join us for events, and 1 on 1 sessions; we will be visiting various locations in NYC, as well as participate in seminars, and exhibitions.<\/p>\n<p>This group is fee-based (pay-to-play), because I want you to invest in this group, and what we are doing. If you value something that someone is doing, you will reward that person. Fees paid also serve as motivation for me to be more creative, and put forth more effort to give you your monies worth, because I know that someone wants the service. This also compels you to be more attentive to me as you expect your monies worth. <br><\/p>\n<p>I am not in the business of collecting members. If you are in the business of playing games, don't waste my time, and test my patience. Don't waste your time. Behave with purpose, go places, do things, and meet others.

Everything seems normal for you but if you start questioning the things that happens like the loss of MH370\/MH17 Malaysia Airlines, 9\/11, GMO Foods from Monsato etc. then you'll see the real structure.&nbsp;It's not only about figuring out where the New World Order (NWO) is activ but also to figure out what we can do as a single person to make a difference. Even small actions can be helpful. We should find our way back to what we really are.. no customers - we're humans with personality!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Other topics related with the NWO can be for example health care, finance, several \"events\", food (GMO's - chemicals etc), politics, invented religions by the elite, media, business, education, military, society and more.<\/p>\n<p>The other part of this Group is the Spiritual Awakening through Spirituality. It is about finding out who we are, what our goals are, why we are here, finding back to Source and Oneness. Therefore we need to find steps to get to these new goals f.e. through Meditation, finding ways to raise and keep your frequency and vibration high and more.<\/p>\n<p>Gaia\/Mother Earth is shifting from the 3rd into the 4th and 5th dimension, you have to decide if you want join this journey or not. If you want to join - you have to find Enlightenment, unconditional love and keep your frequency high. Get rid off fears and low vibrations.

We have come to reclaim the power within, to live in the fullness of our true being. We have come to live in joy. My vision in gathering you all together here is not only to support our healing journeys with sacred plant medicines but also to bring what we have learned and remembered via these journeys back to the real world, to our everyday lives. In my eyes this work is about coming to a place where we find the ceremony in our everyday life, in every step, every moment, every word, and every thought, with or without the medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Those with any experience in this world of plants and shamanism have heard the word \u201cintegration\u201d and how important it is in this work. But what does \u201cintegration\u201d mean? How do we integrate and apply our inner wisdom to the happenings around and within us? How do we dissolve the seeming separation between the world of spirit and the \u201creal world\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I am here simply to share with you my knowledge and experience and to create safe, sacred space for each of you to reconnect to the medicine\/answers\/wisdom\/truth within yourselves and with each other. I offer you a connection to a community of like-hearted beings who are offering their wisdom and tools to advance the whole on this path of awakening.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in transparency and honesty because we all carry the medicine within. Each of us has a unique and equally important gift to offer. Everyone has vision. Everyone holds a special space in the circle of ceremony, in the larger circle that is Life. <br>There are no secrets on the path to awakening. There is only truth, and that truth is for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<p>I envision a life for myself and others where we wake up each day feeling connected, guided and at ease. Feeling real and true to who we are and what is passing through us. Feeling clear and with a sense of purpose. <br>I envision a life of being awake. Awake all the time, not just when working with the medicines. Living the awakeness to the Truth. The Truth that: I AM Whole, I AM Love, I AM Free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What will be offered?:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-We will come together as a community to learn about and share our experiences with sacred plants and to share our work and gifts with others. &nbsp;This can happen both online via webinars and in-person via live events and workshops. <br>-Webinars to prepare participants before medicine ceremonies so they feel grounded, open and at ease before arriving at the ceremony. We will do group meditations, review the preparation recommendations and ask questions to express and clear up any potential confusion or concerns. <br>-Webinars to integrate after the ceremonies. We will do group meditations, share our personal experiences, offer tools and exercises that can be done daily to assist the unfolding of what you experienced with the medicine, and answer any questions participants may have. <br>-Alternate resources that have powerful healing tools that can be practiced daily to continue the awakening process in our everyday life or between the ceremonies. <br>-Opportunities to connect one-on-one or in a group setting to catalyze personal healing. <br>-Access to virtual and live events all over the United States and Canada. <br>-Access to shamanic and energy healing practitioners. <br>-Access to educational information about healing plants, foods, and products. <br>-A place to be heard, seen, and supported.<\/p>\n<p>Who am I? <br>My name is Rachael Devon Rios Sessions. I have come to this work via my own transformational journey and self-seeking. I began my work with the medicine about 6 years ago. I dove in head first after my first ceremony experience, which awakened within me an undeniable knowing that my work with sacred plants was much bigger than my own. I have worked with many wonderful teachers, but my most profound teachers to date have been my late-husband Ramon Orlando and our two beautiful boys, Rafael and Rey. Ramon passed away suddenly in his home country of Colombia last year but continues his work as shaman and taita (teacher) from the world of spirit. We shared many dreams for the expansion of the work with these sacred tools as a vehicle for the awakening of every being. I aim to humbly continue the work we began together and I trust in the guidance and vision I am offered. Besides being a full-time mama, I am a facilitator and organizer of sacred ceremony as well as a shamanic practitioner, Reiki master, yoga teacher and BodyTalk practitioner.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/highres_440357671.jpeg","photo_id":440357671,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/600_440357671.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/5\/0\/7\/thumb_440357671.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":103391762,"name":"Rachael","photo":{"photo_id":134296422,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/member_134296422.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/0\/2\/6\/thumb_134296422.jpeg"}},"members":523,"name":"AYAM Healing with Plants","id":18780380,"state":"NY","urlname":"AYAMHealingwithPlants","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438121636000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"urban-planning","name":"Urban Planning","id":18839},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"cities","name":"Cities","id":69931},{"urlkey":"smart-city","name":"Smart City","id":72764},{"urlkey":"sustainable-cities","name":"Sustainable Cities","id":146918},{"urlkey":"smart-cities","name":"Smart cities","id":205341},{"urlkey":"civic-engagement-technology","name":"Civic Engagement & Technology","id":728662}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Join us if you are passionate about cities, think that public spending should be more open to new solutions and that cities should be amazing problem-solvers.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":128652852,"name":"Sascha Haselmayer","photo":{"photo_id":170891702,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/member_170891702.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/d\/b\/6\/thumb_170891702.jpeg"}},"members":54,"name":"Procurement 2.2 - Transform the way cities solve problems","id":18780723,"state":"NY","urlname":"Procurement-2-2-Transform-the-way-cities-solve-problems","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Union","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438134813000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"blues","name":"Blues","id":135},{"urlkey":"poetry","name":"Poetry","id":222},{"urlkey":"tea","name":"Tea","id":230},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"ballet-and-modern-dance-on-stage","name":"Ballet and Modern Dance on Stage","id":22494},{"urlkey":"black-womens-issues","name":"Black Womens Issues","id":34443},{"urlkey":"fun-for-friends-and-their-friends","name":"Fun for Friends and Their Friends","id":44531},{"urlkey":"bargain-shopping","name":"Bargain Shopping","id":695852},{"urlkey":"meeting-old-friends-and-making-new-friends","name":"Meeting old friends and making new friends","id":1187892}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/meetup-group-sPxvyFeJ\/","rating":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/0\/f\/1\/600_440308913.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><i>If you're on Meet-Up you might have encountered a common theme many face today. It can be a bit more difficult meeting new like minded people to; try new things, exchange ideas and enjoy activities as single adults. \"Living Single\" was one of my favorite tv shows of the 90's! (If you missed out, check it out on youtube) The show was about a group of girlfriends making it through single life. I created this New Jersey group for women ( mid 20's to mid 30's) to cultivate a similar experience.

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 270,000 members in more than 13,000 clubs in 110 countries, offering a proven \u2013 and enjoyable! \u2013 way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.<\/p>\n<p> Most Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.<\/p>\n<p> There is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why Join?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Survey after survey shows that presentation skills are crucial to success in the workplace.

Also have great time going places and experiencing new things as a group.<\/p>","lon":-73.6999969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183309498,"name":"Ladedra Graham","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/a\/0\/highres_242618048.jpeg","photo_id":242618048,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/a\/0\/member_242618048.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/4\/a\/0\/thumb_242618048.jpeg"}},"members":16,"name":"Elmont Toddlers Meetup","id":18798973,"state":"NY","urlname":"Elmont-Toddlers-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"elmont tots"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1438645671000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"financialeng","name":"Financial Engineering","id":10357},{"urlkey":"big-data","name":"Big Data","id":18062},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906},{"urlkey":"machine-learning","name":"Machine Learning","id":29971},{"urlkey":"data-analytics","name":"Data Analytics","id":30928},{"urlkey":"automated-trading-strategies","name":"Automated Trading Strategies","id":32374},{"urlkey":"quantitative-finance","name":"Quantitative Finance","id":34637},{"urlkey":"algorithmic-trading","name":"Algorithmic Trading","id":37627},{"urlkey":"quantitative-analysis","name":"Quantitative Analysis","id":54631},{"urlkey":"data-mining","name":"Data Mining","id":55324},{"urlkey":"forex-algorithmic-trading","name":"Forex Algorithmic Trading","id":87648},{"urlkey":"trading-with-automated-trading-systems","name":"Trading with Automated Trading Systems","id":139531},{"urlkey":"quants","name":"Quants","id":888662},{"urlkey":"algorithms-and-computational-theory","name":"Algorithms and Computational Theory","id":962132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Quant-Club\/","rating":4.5,"description":"<p>The Quant Club is for anyone interested in quantitative finance and machine learning.&nbsp;<span>We plan regular face-to-face meetings in NYC where we share ideas and thoughts about quantitative finance.

Ideas in Krav Maga include: Counterattacking as soon as possible (or attacking pre-emptively). Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points. Maximum effectiveness and efficiency in order to neutralize the opponent as quickly as possible. Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat. Learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn Krav Maga. We can get together to learn Self Defense against any real world dangers and counter in the quickest and most efficient way. The intensity of these workouts will keep you physically fit, develop awareness and build confidence over time. I have asked a friend, David Ordini to show us some of the basics of Krav Maga. We can meetup once a week and learn self defense from a 9 year Krav Maga student who studied under the grand master.

While there are plenty of groups for kids and teens, older adults and even parentless parents, the \"young adult\" age range has been highly overlooked by bereavement support groups. Meanwhile, I have found it hard to relate to both people who lost parents in their teens or middle age; on the one hand, I had an adult relationship with my mother, but I also feel she will never get to see me finish \"growing up\" completely. On top of that, young adults are often living the most transitional, independent portions of their lives. Most of us here in NYC live away from family and our oldest friends, we are building careers, still figuring out who we are, experiencing the dizzying ups and downs of dating, and living in impermanent homes either alone or with strangers. My goal is to create a group who knows what it's like to be amidst the chaotic flows of young adult life while grieving the loss of a parent. This group is not so much based on age as it is what stage of life you feel you are in. If the above resonates with you, you are more than welcome to join. It does not matter how you lost your parent, or even if you are simply coping with a sick parent whom is still alive. Meetings will be casual, simple, fun, and relaxing -- a picnic at the park, a cool little restaurant, a warm bar, etc., and I strongly encourage all members to make suggestions. I just want to meet some new friends who are also figuring out how to live a good life under the heavy weight of grief, to hang out and heal in good company.<\/p>","lon":-73.9800033569,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":26293692,"name":"Chelsey","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/highres_248724742.jpeg","photo_id":248724742,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/member_248724742.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/0\/a\/6\/thumb_248724742.jpeg"}},"members":21,"name":"Young Adults Who Have Lost a Parent","id":18823049,"state":"NY","urlname":"Young-Adults-Who-Have-Lost-a-Parent","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Badasses"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439306769000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"nonprofit","name":"Nonprofit","id":1726},{"urlkey":"sealliance","name":"Social Enterprise","id":6613},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"social-innovation","name":"Social Innovation","id":21808},{"urlkey":"green-entrepreneurs","name":"Green Entrepreneurs","id":23538},{"urlkey":"social-entrepreneurship","name":"Social Entrepreneurship","id":26643},{"urlkey":"socially-conscious-enterprise","name":"Socially Conscious Enterprise","id":73593},{"urlkey":"socially-responsible-business","name":"Socially Responsible Business","id":78007},{"urlkey":"social-impact","name":"Social Impact","id":113871},{"urlkey":"helping-social-enterprises","name":"Helping Social Enterprises","id":139926},{"urlkey":"helping-non-profits","name":"Helping Non-Profits","id":139927},{"urlkey":"non-profit-leadership","name":"Non Profit Leadership","id":1113482}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Social-Entrepreneurship-New-York\/","rating":0,"description":"Call all Social Entrepreneurs!

Let's share in new life milestones, the anxiety of having the aging or geographically distant parents, or just brunches, late night drinks and pep talks or whatever else it is that siblings do for each other.","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/highres_440837233.jpeg","photo_id":440837233,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/600_440837233.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/5\/1\/thumb_440837233.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","members":12,"name":"Only Children Social Support Group","id":18826420,"state":"NY","urlname":"Only-Children-Social-Support-Group","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Only Children"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1439394921000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"comedy","name":"Comedy","id":1001},{"urlkey":"standup","name":"Stand-Up Comedy","id":10225},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy","name":"Stand Up Comedy","id":29712},{"urlkey":"comedy-clubs","name":"Comedy Clubs","id":43941},{"urlkey":"comedy-club","name":"Comedy Club","id":88286},{"urlkey":"standup-comedy","name":"standup comedy","id":108531},{"urlkey":"people-that-like-stand-up-comedy","name":"people that like stand up comedy","id":422202},{"urlkey":"stand-up-comedy-show","name":"Stand up comedy show","id":424002}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Yorks-East-Village-Stand-Up-Comedy-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>Come to Solas for an intimate evening of hanging and stand up comedy.
