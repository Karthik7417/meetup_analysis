I do suggest to bring your own cigars &amp; take the cutting fee. They do have a nice selection of cigars but very pricey. A very good size lounge with a bi level. A great place to bring a guest or date. Waitress service &amp; a food menu is available. This will be on a Friday night and at 9:00 they do have a live jazz band with a no charge policy. We have used this place many times and they are very attentive to our group. \u00a0If you are a new member, a great event to start off with and meet your fellow smokers.

Some of these issues have been investigated in her films, including\u00a0<i>Citizenfour<\/i>, which won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Documentary, and in her reporting, which was awarded a 2014 Pulitzer Prize.<\/p> <p>For the exhibition, Poitras is creating an interrelated series of installations in the Whitney\u2019s eighth-floor Hurst Family Galleries. The exhibition expands on her project to document post\u20139\/11 America, engaging visitors in formats outside her non-fiction filmmaking. Instead she will create immersive environments that incorporate documentary footage, architectural interventions, primary documents, and narrative structures to invite visitors to interact with the material in strikingly intimate and direct ways.<\/p> <p>The title,\u00a0<b>Astro Noise<\/b>, refers to the faint background disturbance of thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang and is the name Edward Snowden gave to an encrypted file containing evidence of mass surveillance by the National Security Agency that he shared with Poitras in 2013.

Some of these issues have been investigated in her films, including\u00a0<i>Citizenfour, <\/i>which won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Documentary, and in her reporting, which was awarded a 2014 Pulitzer Prize.<\/p> <p>For the exhibition, Poitras is creating an interrelated series of installations in the Whitney\u2019s eighth-floor Hurst Family Galleries. The exhibition expands on her project to document post\u20139\/11 America, engaging visitors in formats outside her non-fiction filmmaking. Instead she will create immersive environments that incorporate documentary footage, architectural interventions, primary documents, and narrative structures to invite visitors to interact with the material in strikingly intimate and direct ways.<\/p> <p>The title,\u00a0<b>Astro Noise<\/b>, refers to the faint background disturbance of thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang and is the name Edward Snowden gave to an encrypted file containing evidence of mass surveillance by the National Security Agency that he shared with Poitras in 2013. The Snowden archive partially inspired Poitras\u2019s presentation at the Whitney.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/f\/a\/600_446979674.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"This is a multi-group meetup.

So, the \"virtual humanity\" should be possible \u201cas is\u201d?<\/p> <p>- Is a virtual reality (for upload) should match physical reality or it can be separate Wonderland or both?<\/p> <p>- What is next upload from the initial upload? Super virtual reality? Dream inside a dream, inside a dream and so on? What can be Ultimate Upload? How we can describe an evolution of uploads?<\/p> <p>- If consciousness is a fundamental feature of the Cosmos then we were downloaded (hierarchically) from some master copy and now are coming (hierarchically) \u201cback home\u201d through the Uploading?<\/p> <p>- Is there digital or algorithmic equivalent to consciousness?<\/p> <p><b>Ethical<\/b><\/p> <p>- Actually, there is no \u201cUploaded you\u201d, but only real biological you and your unknown digital copy which can function with or without you.<\/p> <p>- Digital ethics can be very different. First of all, now you are immortal (conditionally of course) and not depend on any vital needs. No pain, fear, anger and other negative biological emotions. Actually, you would create your own astonishing emotions, friends, pleasure etc. Ultimately, you would be able to duplicate many of \u201cyou\u201d, or even create a great team of \u201cyou\u201d with multiple presence experience, permanent connection to central super intelligent main frame etc. So, the difference between biological \u201coriginal you\u201d and uploaded gigantic \u201csuper you\u201d can be as huge as difference between you and banana (only about 50% difference in DNA code)<\/p> <p>- Is unique individual feelings, happiness, pain, anger etc. are uploadable? Can future technology transfer emotions and higher senses, such as conscience, aesthetics, love, dreams, the experience of art, intellectual satisfaction, etc.?<\/p> <p>- Is there should be the filter of what should not be uploaded and stay with humans?<\/p> <p>- Is digital evil possible?<\/p> <p><b>Biological<\/b><\/p> <p>- \u00a0Are neurons circuit, patterns etc. are fully detectable for replication?<\/p> <p>- \u00a0Is brain computable?

On this one-night-only show, Jovanovic will present a series of surreal photographic portraits that question the existing cliches of femininity.

Free and open to public.<\/p> <p>April 1st: Joss Whedon's \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (2012) [PG-13] 1 hr. 49 mins.<\/p> <p>Premiering before the show: Much Ado About Dinner, a short film by Chris X. Carroll.<\/p> <p>Though not sure of the exact date, scholars are pretty confident that William Shakespeare died just about exactly 400 years ago this month. To commemorate that First Friday Films presents one of our favorite works from Shakespeare, Joss Whedon\u2019s Much Ado About Nothing.<\/p> <p>Joss Whedon was deep in post production on the Avengers in 2011 when he found himself with two unexpected weeks off. He and his wife, Kai Cole, had been hosting readings of Shakespeare plays in their living room. Whedon had a birthday coming up, and Cole decided to give him a movie as a present. Making lemons out of lemonade, the two decided to shoot a guerilla production of a full length film in twelve shooting days, on location at their home. Then Whedon would go back to work at the big studio, and finish post and editing on Much Ado on evenings and weekends.<\/p> <p>Using hand held cameras, natural light, and what appear to be an awful lot of cocktails the skeleton crew created a gorgeous and real production of Shakespeare\u2019s funniest play. Much Ado About Nothing was shot in digital black and white, on modern cine cameras very similar to what is available to consumers. Whedon cast many of his favorite actors, who\u2019d been attending the readings. Astute viewers will recognize many faces familiar from TV and movies: Nathan Fillion and Sean Maher from Firefly, Rikki Lindhome and Tom Lenk from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and many others.<\/p> <p>This film was made as somewhat of an antidote to the huge corporate behemoth Whedon was creating (the Avengers). Even more germane, it\u2019s made by someone who loves movies. You can see it in every frame. Taking a bunch of actors, one step removed from reading plays on the sofa and throwing them together helps create a funny, vibrant film that crackles with charisma. All from a 400 year old script, to which Whedon neither added nor cut a single word.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/piermontlibrary.org\/media\/gallery\/2016-Mar\/Much-Ado_tn.png\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Rockland-Social-Group\/events\/228194066\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"Piermont Library - 1st Friday Movie","id":"qjvzjhyvgbcb","time":1459553400000,"updated":1459565130000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1276326506000,"name":"The Rockland Social Calendar","group_lon":-74.1100006104,"id":1659920,"urlname":"The-Rockland-Social-Group","group_lat":41.1300010681,"who":"Event Organizers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"07042","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Montclair","address_1":"11 Park Street","name":"Montclair Eckankar Center","lon":-74.218727,"id":16692002,"state":"NJ","lat":40.815441,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.8182344437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445399616000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Free Discussions on\u00a0<br\/><i>How to Survive Spiritually in Our Times<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/e\/3\/600_433065539.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>6 Open\u00a0Sessions - 1st Fridays at 7:30 pm<\/b><\/p> <p>2015: November 6th and December 4th<\/p> <p>Note: No class on 1\/1 due to holiday.<\/p> <p>2016: February 5th, March 4th, April 1st, and May 6th<\/p> <p><b>Please join us for one, some, or all interactive discussions<\/b>\u00a0based on the book\u00a0<i>How to Survive Spiritually in Our Times<\/i>\u00a0by Harold Klemp, the Spiritual Leader of ECKANKAR.\u00a0It is not necessary to have the book to attend a class.\u00a0Come share your stories, experiences, and questions<b>.<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 Learn how to get help and follow inner guidance<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Explore spiritual tools that can help transform your life\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Discover how to move from surviving to thriving\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>All Are Welcome<\/b>\u00a0<\/p> <p>ECKANKAR Center\u00a0<br\/>11 Park Street, Montclair, NJ<\/p> <p>There is on-street parking and two municipal parking lots in the area.

This should be a fun meetup. This is not an Amateur or Gimmick Comedy show, Dangerfields features best of the best comedians who have performed in leading clubs, motion pictures and tv shows such as Tonight Show with Jay leno, Jimmy Fallon, Letterman, Seth meyers, Conan and Comedy Central. HBO's most successful comedy TV specials were taped at this club.<\/p> <p>Im very excited to have the meetup here, We are getting tickets that are $40.00 each free for this group, its a 2 drink minimum as in any other club but if you get a drink at the bar before the show it counts toward the drink minimum which is very rare for a comedy club and theres a full food menu. If you want to just stop by have a drink and meet your fellow meetup members and not stay for the show you can do that too youll still get a ticket if you wanna use it for another time.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you there. This weeks is hosted by Q (Quinten Heggs), Lineup included Rob Magnotti (Comedy Central), Lenny Marcus (Comedy Central), DC Benny, Brian Scott Mcfadden (Tonight Show), Dante Nero! Dustin Chaffin (Showtime!), Shawn Cornelius (BET) and more will be named.<\/p> <p>Ive personally never been to this club, but the Organizer will have a meetup sign, we all sit together, and meet each other so look for the meetup sign and the organizer will give you the Free Tickets.<\/p> <p>Show Starts at 8:30, so come at 7:45 to meet your fellow meetup members!

At an age when most artists\u2019 best work is behind them, Mr. Taylor continues to win public and critical acclaim for the vibrancy, relevance and power of his creations...Mr. Taylor has made 139 dances since 1954, many of which have attained iconic status. He has covered a breathtaking range of topics, but recurring themes include life and death; the natural world and man\u2019s place within it; love and sexuality in all gender combinations; and iconic moments in American history. His poignant looks at soldiers, those who send them into battle, and those they leave behind prompted the New York Times to hail him as \u201camong the great war poets\u201d \u2013 high praise indeed for an artist in a wordless medium. While some of his dances have been termed \u201cdark\u201d and others \u201clight,\u201d the majority of his works are dualistic, mixing elements of both extremes. And while his work has largely been iconoclastic, he has also made some of the most purely romantic, most astonishingly athletic, and downright funniest dances ever put on stage.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/4\/a\/highres_338000042.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/e\/5\/4\/highres_338000052.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Through a special deal directly with the Paul Taylor Dance Company, our Vegetarian &amp; Vegan Meetup Group has the opportunity to see the troop for 50% off at Lincoln Center.<\/b> We got these tickets months ago, with choice of seats and performances.

The choreography of the first section is repeated step for step in the second section but performed by different dancers to different music and lighting. As the score changes from pastoral to menacing and the lighting darkens, the second set of dancers perform the steps with different emphasis and attack than the first, and as a result the viewer\u2019s perception of the exact same choreography is altered. \"A barrel of laughs \u2014 a delicious lampoon of dance styles of various periods, climes and persuasions.

Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:40p.

On West Mountain we will then take the TT down West, and up the Timp. We will then take the Rd down the Timp, and up the backside of Bald Mountain. We will then take the C trail back to the cars. The hike will be about 10 miles with four good steep climbs, and will be a fun friendly, but demanding hike with a reasonable number of stops. Leader determines the pace, route, number of stops and duration of stops. If you want to run do not come. If you want to stroll chose another hike. This hike is not easy, and involves 3100 feet of elevation gain. No dogs allowed. Bring at least 3 quarts of water your lunch and wear hiking boots. Rain Cancels.

You will also be treated to a 30-minute speech by a native speaker, speaking at normal speed. A native speaker (or language expert) will also be there to correct your written essay, so you will leave knowing where you made your mistakes. \u00a0NOTE: if you enjoy spending 12 hours by yourself at home reading, writing, listening, and finding a native speaker on your own, great! \u00a0Then this program is not for you. \u00a0This program makes 12 hours of intense language study fun, sociable, motivational, and efficient--because it's all prepared in advance for you. \u00a0Seriously, how many of you have recently spent 12 hours ON YOUR OWN studying non-stop from 10am - 10pm? \u00a0The truth: it just doesn't happen. \u00a0So yeah, you can do much of these things on your own, and you can set up your own events if you want. \u00a0But if you enjoy having ME do it for you, and make it easy for you to focus with the added discipline of having other language learners in the room with you, then this is for you. :)<\/p> <p><b>WARNING:<\/b> this course is not for lazy people and NOT for beginners. It WILL be exhausting; it WILL be tiring; and that's good because directly as a result, it WILL end up being (quite probably) the most practical and useful foreign language course you have ever experienced. All in just one day. \u00a0Pretty awesome if I say so myself, and yup, I'll be participating too! \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>REFUND POLICY: <\/b><br\/>* You will NOT be given a refund if you simply cancel after paying--others are counting on your being there, so you need to commit. This policy is my way to help ensure that it is more likely you will attend. If there is a serious medical or family emergency, please provide a note from your doctor or other official verifying this fact. Otherwise, I suggest you just attend (haha) or transfer your registration to a friend who speaks the same language (with our permission). Please try to respect your fellow students (and me!) who are counting on you being there.<br\/>* If you pay, but on the day of the immersion, simply do not show up, you will NOT be given a refund because others were counting on you to be their language partners.<br\/>* If you pay, attend the event, and participate in all exercises and then truly feel the course did not improve your language skills in any measurable way, you will be given a full refund. However, before paying, you agree to read the course description above in full, and fully acknowledge that this is not a traditional language class\u2014much of the work will be forced solitary or group practice. Do NOT attend this course if you expect to be spoon fed everything. One of the main purposes of this program is to force intermediate and advanced students to do the things they typically do not do by themselves on a regular basis. \u201cAll we did is read and write and talk to one another and listen to audio\u201d is not a valid reason for \u201cnot meeting your expectations\u201d\u2014um, that is precisely the purpose of this course and precisely what will help develop your fluency! That being said, please go into this knowing what to expect.<\/p> <p><b>I look very much forward to seeing many of you at the event!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>-Monroe Mann, Esq.\u00a0<br\/><\/b><b>Founder, Fluency Project\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p>P.S. - In answer to your question, \"Why are you charging for a meetup?\", my response is, \"My dear, why should you get this for free?\" :D \u00a0Most meetups are a colossal waste of time, and are ineptly organized. \u00a0This event will be impeccably organized, and expertly driven, and that should already be clear. \u00a0I've spent tens and tens of hours putting this together, and will spend even more time and money creating the materials. \u00a0The space costs money. \u00a0The native speakers cost money. \u00a0 Meetup takes 10% for the credit card fees. \u00a0My time too is valuable (don't you agree?). \u00a0My event WILL help you gain fluency, and $125 is extremely generous given all that you will receive. \u00a0I know I could charge twice if not thrice this amount and still feel good about myself. :D \u00a0But my hope is to keep the fee as low as possible while also paying expenses. \u00a0Hope this answers your question!\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/TheFluencyProject\/events\/228695478\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":44100000,"name":"FORCED FLUENCY\u2122 ONE-DAY IMMERSION PROGRAM (TEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES!)","id":"228695478","time":1459604700000,"updated":1459739283000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1427562418000,"name":"The Fluency Project -- New York","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18523742,"urlname":"TheFluencyProject","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Linguaphiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Read description.","name":"Read description below for time and details.","lon":-74.005974,"id":10442182,"state":"NY","lat":40.714352,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.60664105415,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458593791000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We\u2019ll have a short, brisk walk in the northern Bronx, starting at Allerton Avenue ending at 12:30 at Lehman College for the 1:00 free Metropolitan Opera Simulcast of <i>Madame Butterfly.<\/i>\u00a0 MEET at 9:45 a.m. so we can leave promptly at 10:00.\u00a0 Email <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> for the meeting place the week of the walk, or call.\u00a0 Leader: Jean Arrington,[masked]-4119.\u00a0 Nonmembers:\u00a0 $3.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/outdoorsclubny\/events\/229770672\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"MADAME BUTTERFLY AND THE BRONX","id":"229770672","time":1459604700000,"updated":1459616716000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1334015638000,"name":"NYC Outdoors Club","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":3637432,"urlname":"outdoorsclubny","group_lat":40.75,"who":"city walkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":18,"headcount":0,"distance":2.81856846809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":8,"created":1458007977000,"fee":{"amount":8.85000038147,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Please be there 15 minutes earlier so you can get set up, and bring a white and a red t-shirt.<\/p> <p>If this game is full click here for our calendar and see other game slots!<\/p> <p>Thank you,<\/p> <p>Paul<\/p> <p>Details Below:<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Game style and Rules:<\/p> <p>1.

It's responding to the rhythm, attitude, or story of the music you're hearing. In short, it's having a dance party in your living room, while walking through the park--hilarious and exhilarating.

As a group, we will choose 2 different wines. Both can be made without sulfite (preservatives).

This step takes 45-60 minutes.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Step Two - Stabilizing &amp; Clearing<\/b><br\/>Add ingredients to stop fermentation and facilitate clearing (falling of sediments to the bottom of the wine container), and de-gassing the wine with a blending tool using a cordless drill. It is not necessary that all of us attend this part of the process. This step takes 30-45 minutes.<\/p> <p><b>Step Three - Bottling<\/b><br\/>The most fun step. Fill the bottles, cork, and label. Takes 60-90 minutes, or as long as you need. Your wine is ready to enjoy at this step, so we will bring in some food and snacks, and make it an extraordinary social event. And at the end \u2013 we take home our finished Wines.<\/p> <p>Wine-making is done in \u201csmall batches\u201d, which consists of making 6 gallons of the same wine, which yields 28 full-size (750ml) bottles.

That experience is known as samsara. Our investigation over the next few weeks will focus on those challenging central states of samsara as well as the states that represent the freedom from those challenges.<\/p> <p>The\u00a0three mind states we find at the hub of the Wheel are Delusion\/Ignorance, Hatred and Greed. They are potent enough forces in our life to be called the Three Poisons. Each contributes to\u00a0keeping the Wheel turning, and when we investigate fully, we can see that all of our\u00a0dissatisfaction and suffering and unskillful actions can be traced back to one of these three elements.<\/p> <p>Conversely, each of these poisons is counterbalanced by a state that represents\u00a0freedom or liberation from the negative influences. Freedom from\u00a0Delusion and Ignorance is Wisdom, freedom from\u00a0Hatred is Loving-Kindness and Compassion and\u00a0freedom from\u00a0Greed is Generosity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We'll take each of these pairings in turn beginning with Delusion\/Ignorance and its counterbalance of Wisdom.<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

In 1991, during excavations for a new federal building in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, a colonial-era burial ground containing the remains of an estimated 15-20,000 Africans was discovered. Today, a memorial commemorates those interred in the African Burial Ground, and a visitor center addresses the history of African-descended people in early New York as well as the struggle to preserve the burial ground itself.<\/p> <p>The African Burial Ground Visitor Center is the most-visited of all New York City\u2019s National Park Service sites since its opening in February, 2010. Though the bones of those buried at the African Burial Ground were first discovered by the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1991, it took a great deal of time and effort before both the memorial and the visitor center came to fruition.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The GSA was able to identify what it had discovered, thanks to a 1755 map of New York, where the location was marked as the \u201cNegros Burial Ground.\u201d The GSA then hired a team of archaeologists, but elected to pursue both excavation and construction, thus destroying some remains in the process. After Fox News broke the story of what was occurring at the site, an outcry arose from black New Yorkers. Construction was halted due to protests and political interventions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In 1993, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and an archaeological team from Howard University undertook the project of studying the 419 exhumed remains. The project lasted 10 years, till 2003, the same year in which the GSA struck an agreement with the National Park Service, creating the Development and Public Investment of the Exterior Memorial and the Interpretive Center. On October 4, 2003, a re-internment ceremony involving eight cities, 10,000 participants, and lasting for five days occurred, beginning in Washington, D.C., and ending in New York City.<\/p> <p>The federal Ted Weiss building, where the visitor center and part of the memorial are contained, was completed in 2005. (Six artworks commissioned as an extension of the memorial line the lobby. Images and more information are available here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.africanburialground.gov\/ABG_Artwork.htm\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.africanburialground.gov\/ABG_Artwork.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.africanburialground.gov\/ABG_Artwork.htm<\/a><\/a> ) Artist Rodney Leon beat out 61 competitors in the memorial design competition. An official opening and dedication was held on October 7, 2007, and was attended by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Congressman Charles B. Rangel, among others.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The visitor center, which opened in 2010, seeks to educate visitors on four topics: \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p>1) The archaeological studies and findings made by Howard University\u2019s team at the burial ground.<\/p> <p>In the archaeological section, visitors can use interactive touch screens to consider relevant questions, such as, \u201cWhat can bones tell us?\u201d and receive detailed answers. Replicas of artifacts found buried with the bodies (all original artifacts have been re-buried) are on display. Four hundred and nineteen skeletons had been uncovered before excavation was stopped, and a large, lighted panel displays photographs of the bones. Each burial is marked by a number, with the age and sex of the buried listed. The exhibit notes that few of the slaves interred here lived past age 45; nearly half of those excavated had not lived past the age of 12.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2) The lives of slaves in the 18th century.<\/p> <p>The historical section, which focuses on the way slaves lived in the 18th century, takes a more personalized, rather than scientific approach. Descriptions of work, newspaper ads calling for the return of runaways, and the listing of laws that restricted the movement of slaves are all present, conveying the daily realities and hardships that the enslaved faced. The stories of individuals are also displayed on panels, giving visitors a fuller picture of those buried at the African Burial Ground. In the center of the exhibit are life-sized models gathered around coffins, meant to evoke what a funeral held at the African Burial Ground may have been like. A dramatization of a funeral is also shown in a short film.<\/p> <p>3) Modern-day African-American and African culture.<\/p> <p>The third exhibit in the visitor\u2019s center concentrates on both present-day Africa and New York, discussing how modern African-American New Yorkers carry on the traditions of their ancestors, and displaying artifacts from countries such as Nigeria and Mali.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>4) The campaign that led to the eventual creation of the African Burial Ground memorial and visitor center.<\/p> <p>The fourth and final exhibit launches into a timeline of how the African Burial Ground visitor\u2019s center and monument came to be, from 1989 to the present. Scrapbooks filled with newspaper clippings about the protest are available for reading, and a video of the re-internment cemetery plays on a loop. In a sub-section titled \u201cWhy our heritage matters,\u201d visitors are also able to select and watch interviews with different people who were involved in the fight to have the burial ground recognized. They are also able to leave their thoughts about the exhibit via recording on a webcam or writing on index cards.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The memorial is located on a quiet block, just around the corner from the visitor\u2019s center. The space, which is open to the public, is dominated by Rodney Leon\u2019s black granite slab, on which is inscribed, \u201cFor all those who were lost, For all those who were stolen, For all those who were left behind, For all those who were not forgotten\u201d. To the right of the slab rest the seven mounds where the excavated remains and artifacts were re-interred. To the left, partially formed by Leon\u2019s slab, is the libation chamber, a reflective space meant to invoke the feeling of a ship\u2019s hold. Just beyond is the Circle of the Diaspora, a map which depicts the forced removal of Africans from their homeland to varying parts of the world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>A sign asks that visitors respect the memorial space, and that they do not eat, run, or talk on cell phones on the ground. When designing the space, Leon intended it to be a \u201cliving memorial\u201d\u2014a place to always remember those buried here.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/a\/f\/a\/600_446979674.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Everyone attending our 90-minute Ranger-led tour, which starts promptly at 11:30 A.M., must arrive by 11:15 A.M. in order to go through a mandatory airport-style security screening.

Broadway singing great, <b>Marni Nixon<\/b> guides singers and the audience through an enjoyable afternoon of familiar music from Broadway &amp; The American Songbook.<\/p> <p>American soprano Marni Nixon\u2019s legendary career is as broad as it is versatile. \u00a0Having achieved world-class stardom in opera, musical theater, and popular music genres, Ms. Nixon has been performing her way into the ears and hearts of audiences around the world for more than five decades.\u00a0<\/p> <p>From a very young age, Ms. Nixon\u2019s perfect pitch and impeccable sight-reading skills enabled her to perform with the utmost precision the most challenging vocal works of the 20th century; and her incredible musicianship made her one of the most sought-after singers by legends such as Leonard Bernstein and Igor Stravinsky, both with whom she worked and personally knew. \u00a0As a young singer in the classical world, Ms. Nixon accomplished more than most aspiring opera singers dream to in a lifetime: performing roles such as Violetta Val\u00e9ry (La Traviata), P\u00e9richole (La P\u00e9richole), Musetta (La Boh\u00e9me), Nanetta (Falstaff), and Zerbinetta (Ariadne auf Naxos) with world-renowned opera companies including Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera, and Los Angeles Opera, and the Public Broadcasting Station\u2019s Televised Opera performances \u2013 to name a very few.<\/p> <p>Ms. Nixon has widely performed as a concert and oratorio soloist in works such as Bach\u2019s BWV 198: La\u00df, F\u00fcrstin, la\u00df noch einen Strahl and Canteloube\u2019s Chants d\u2019Auvergne; and has appeared with the New York Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. \u00a0A champion of contemporary works, Ms. Nixon has performed Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, Hovanhess\u2019s Avak, the Healer, and Peter Maxwell Davies's Miss Donnithorne's Maggot; as well as premiered Pierre Boulez'sImprovisation sur Mallarm\u00e9 I under Bernstein. \u00a0Ms. Nixon also toured with famed illustrious Liberace and the beloved musical entertainer Victor Borge, bringing musical and comedic improvisation to eager audiences across the country.<\/p> <p>Outside of the classical world, Marni Nixon is most recognized as the singing voice for actresses Deborah Kerr in The King and I, Natalie Wood in West Side Story, Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, and Marilyn Monroe in Gentleman Prefer Blondes. \u00a0Often called \u201cghosting,\u201d Marni Nixon\u2019s singing work for actresses behind the silver screen earned her the title of \u201cThe Voice of Hollywood.\u201d \u00a0Stepping out into the spotlight, Ms. Nixon went on to perform dozens of roles such as Sister Sophia (film and stage versions of The Sound of Music), Heidi Schiller (Follies), and Guido's Mother (Nine). \u00a0She has won several awards for her performance of Edna in Taking My Turn, also the first off-Broadway musical to be filmed for PBS\u2019s Great Performances series. \u00a0Ms. Nixon has, in fact, earned numerous awards for her outstanding performances, including Grammy Awards in the category of Best Classical Performance, Vocal Soloist for her recordings of 9 Early Songs: The Cabaret Songs of Arnold Schoenberg and Copland: 8 Poems of Emily Dickinson; 4 Emmy Awards for her performances on Boomerang, a children\u2019s television show with a spectacular 25-year run; as well as her most recent Peabody Award for Outstanding Excellence in American Music.<\/p> <p>As evidenced by her successful tours as a concert artist throughout Europe, Ms. Nixon has devoted much of her time to reviving the art of the song recital. \u00a0She inspires a new generation of talent as close to her heart as her own accomplished son Andrew Gold \u2013 musical director for recording artist Linda Ronstandt, and writer of the Golden Girls theme song \u201cThank You for Being a Friend\u201d \u2013 and as far-reaching as the countless young singers and actors from all genres around the world. \u00a0Ms. Nixon currently dispenses her invaluable expertise and vivacious charm through private teaching, as well as leading master classes and workshops across the country.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Rehearsal Hall - 7th Floor","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Art-Song-Preservation-Society-of-NY\/events\/229438181\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Marni Nixon's ENCORES Master Class","id":"229438181","time":1459616400000,"updated":1459690693000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1241577160000,"name":"The Art Song Preservation Society of NY","group_lon":-74,"id":1451147,"urlname":"The-Art-Song-Preservation-Society-of-NY","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Art Song Recitalists\/Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"18 W 18th St Fl 6","name":"Cap 21","lon":-73.993294,"id":19617492,"lat":40.739128,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":37,"headcount":26,"distance":0.772462248802,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459026535000,"fee":{"amount":20,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Many members have been asking for our Saturday Figure Drawing Session.<\/p> <p>Join us for <b>three hours of figure drawing<\/b> in the heart of The Flatiron District.<\/p> <p>This session is open to sketchers of all levels.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/2\/1\/6\/600_441128726.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>What makes our sessions different?\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022 We work in a large, clean, well-lit space.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022 Sketchers\u00a0can concentrate because our room is quiet while the model is posing.<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0(Latecomers can be seated at a break.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Every hour we take a break to look each others drawings (if you choose to put yours out.)

It's basically the same as the weekday meetup, just scheduled in addition so that those of us who can't make it during the week can still take part. Here's some more information...\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'm a new stay-at-home mom in the Westchester area looking to meet other moms with infants. I've always wanted to join a book club but it was tough while working full-time and even harder now with a baby. So why don't we try to get together after the holidays in early 2016 and start our own? Moms AND babies will be welcome (expecting moms too, of course!), and don't put too much pressure on yourself if you can't finish the assigned books. I'll try to pick some with Audible recordings (GREAT service to use while at home with a little one) and even movies so that those of us with limited time can still join in discussion. And hey, if you don't get to the book at all, that's ok -- this is about meeting other moms and their kids through a fun activity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>For our first meetup, let's try reading\/listening to\/watching Wuthering Heights. If you have a Kindle, I think it's a free download, and it looks to be inexpensive on Audible. Also, a great version with Charlotte Riley and Tom Hardy is streaming now on Amazon Prime.\u00a0<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Book-Club-Moms-Westchester\/events\/227531300\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":7200000,"name":"Book club meet and greet weekend edition!

We're going to get into the act ourselves in early April by visiting the Old New York haunts of the famous Irish author and playwright Brendan Behan.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/4\/d\/600_434804621.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nBehan [masked]) was the sensation of the Irish literary world of the 1950s with the publication of his autobiographical novel \"Borstal Boy\" and plays \"The Quare Fellow\" and \"The Hostage\". His works turned the world on to Irish wit and humor while exploring the themes of human freedom and liberation.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/9\/1\/600_434804689.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nBorn and raised in Dublin, Behan loved New York and lived here off and on between 1960 and 1963. To Behan, New York was the \"greatest show on earth, for everyone\" and \"my Lourdes, where I go for spiritual refreshment.\"<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/4\/d\/600_434804877.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nA confirmed alcoholic, Behan also sought liquid refreshment in the pubs and bars of New York. Many of his favorite New York haunts are long gone, but some remain and we are going to visit some of these venues for this meetup.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/c\/0\/600_434804992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nI'm still working out the full details but here are some places on the itinerary. There will be some walking but that's part of the experience as Behan was famous for wandering around New York and visiting pubs and bars as he went.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/2\/f\/600_434805359.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sardis.com\/htmldocs\/cms\/\">Sardi's Restaurant<\/a>: Sardi's has been a Theater District fixture since the 1920s. Being involved with the New York theater scene, this became one of Behan's New York hangouts. The after-party after the New York premiere of The Hostage was held here and Behan later participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the New York Times here. Sardi's was also a frequent first stop for Behan and friends before visiting other nightclubs in the city.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hurleysnyc.com\/\">Hurley's Saloon<\/a>: Behan made several appearances on the Jack Paar Show--forerunner to the Tonight Show--when he was in New York. Behan was not good in front of a TV camera, so he would typically loosen himself up with the drink before going on. The chatty, inebriated Behan was a big hit with US TV audiences. Hurley's, an old New York bar dating to 1870, that Rockefeller Center was literally built around, was likely where he went to drink pre-show in those days. The bar even had cue lights to let NBC TV employees know when they had to get back to their shows. Unfortunately, Hurley's lost its lease at its original Rockefeller Center location in 1999. The bar was relocated and re-created a few blocks away on W. 48th Street and is still owned by the same family that last owned the Rockefeller Center location. We will stop here and visit the original location on the walk.<\/p> <p><br\/>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shubert.nyc\/theatres\/cort\">Cort Theatre<\/a>: Behan first arrived in New York in September 1960 for the Broadway opening of his play \"The Hostage\" at the Cort Theatre on West 48th. We'll stop here between bars. We'll also visit the site of the former Monte Rosa restaurant on the same block. This is where Behan fell off the wagon in October 1960.<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.algonquinhotel.com\/\">The Algonquin Hotel<\/a>: This was Behan's first home in New York in 1960 and '61 and where he conducted his first media interviews. His drunken antics would later get him banned from the hotel. The Algonquin's famed Oak Room is no more, but we can visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.algonquinhotel.com\/blue-bar\">Blue Bar<\/a> and\/or the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.algonquinhotel.com\/lobby\"> Lobby Lounge<\/a>. Behan was infamous for throwing back whiskeys in the latter.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/e\/0\/600_434805792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.overlooknyc.com\/\">Overlook<\/a>: Behan was on the wagon when he first arrived in New York, but he loved the Irish pubs of 3rd Avenue and the camaraderie with his fellow Irish they offered. He would visit them regularly even when he was only drinking soda water, staying out 'til all hours of the night in them. The famous literary bar Costello's Saloon at the corner of 3rd and 44th was on his list of places to visit before he even came to New York and would soon become his favorite New York City watering hole. The Costello's that Behan frequented is long gone, but the bar moved half a block away on East 44th before closing about a decade ago. The Overlook now operates out of this space, but it's the closest we can get to the old Costello's.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/3\/8\/a\/600_434805962.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pjclarkes.com\/third-avenue\/\">PJ Clarke's<\/a>: PJ Clarke's has been a New York classic since the 1880s and it was another of Behan's favorite 3rd Avenue haunts in the early 1960s. It's one of the few bars to survive 3rd Avenue's transformation from gritty, blue-collar residential neighborhood under the 3rd Avenue El to the upscale, skyscraper-dominated area it is today. PJ Clarke's remains one of the best New York bars for celebrity sightings.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/2\/a\/d\/600_434805741.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/0\/3\/5\/600_434805109.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>PS: Most of the photos on this page were taken during Behan's time in New York.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Old-New-York-Bars\/events\/228668418\/","yes_rsvp_count":32,"name":"New York in Brendan Behan's Footsteps","id":"228668418","time":1459621800000,"updated":1459723780000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1227316715000,"name":"Old New York Bars","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":1325945,"urlname":"Old-New-York-Bars","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Washington Square N","lon":-73.998083,"phone":"(347)2105342","name":"Washington Square Park","id":399150,"state":"NY","lat":40.730287,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.42937982082,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455387616000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/events\/1738740433011542\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/events\/1738740433011542\/<\/a><\/p> <p>Pillow fight starts at 3pm.

From the Baby Boomers to Generation X to Millennials, we are all have a place in the global society of humanity. As the Baby Boomers grow older and pass from this life, we find ourselves beginning to be governed by a technologically-savvy Millennial generation. With such comfort among technology, Baby Boomers and Generation X's find themselves trying to balance their way of being in this fast and ever-changing world.

Begin this loop hike at Lookout Inn at State Line Lookout. From here, you can begin by going either south or north. To begin south: Begin at Lookout Inn and go to the ski trail entrance at the northwest corner of the parking area. At your first left, take ski trail \"A\" which also overlaps with the aqua-blazed Long Path. Follow until it comes to a junction, where you turn left to cross the entrance road to State Line Lookout (use caution here). Continue through the gap in the parapet stones and into the woods. The trail goes down a ravine on stone steps.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/9\/f\/b\/600_447931227.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This is the Women's Federation Monument, where we'll meet up with anyone who wants to opt for the shorter version.<\/p> <p>At the base of the ravine, the aqua Long Path crosses a wooden bridge and then intersects the blue-and-white-blazed Forest View Trail; here you will turn left (east) on the Forest View Trail, taking it down to the river, where it will end at the white-blazed Shore Trail (this descent is very steep). Take the white Shore Trail north about 0.25 mi. to the beginning of the Giant Stairs, a formation created by thousands of rock slides over the eons.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/9\/5\/600_447931381.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>You\u2019ll scramble over the rocks for about 1 mi., following the white blazes all the way (some of these, you\u2019ll notice, are in the shape of half-moons\u2014don\u2019t let this throw you). The Shore Trail finally levels off along the river, and goes to Peanut Leap Cascade.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/a\/4\/6\/600_447931302.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAfter a steep ascent on the white Shore Trail, turn left (south) on the aqua-blazed Long Path, cross the stream, and follow the Long Path back to start. To begin north: Head north along Old Route 9W, noting the aqua blazes of the Long Path along the way\u2014you\u2019ll be following these markers for the first part of this hike. About 100 yd. along, the Long Path leaves the old cement road and goes into the woods, more or less following the cliff edge (and for a while overlapping Ski Trail E). About 1 mi. along, you come to the State Line Monument and a chain link fence; here the trail jogs right (east) to go around the fence, and begins to descend a series of stone steps, with excellent vistas north toward the Tappan Zee. At the base of the steps, the trail jogs to the left, to bear northwest for a time and so headed away from the river. In less than 0.5 mi., you\u2019ll cross a stream on wooden bridges. Across this stream, turn right (east), at the start of the white-blazed Shore Trail that follows the stream toward the river. Just before the river, this trail gets quite steep and is prone to erosion\u2014use caution. You will arrive at river level at the base of Peanut Leap Cascade. Continue on the white-blazed Shore Trail as it heads south along the Hudson, then follow it over the Giant Stairs, finally to the trailhead of the blue-and-white-blazed Forest View Trail. This will lead you steeply back up to the aqua-blazed Long Path. Here, turn right (north), cross the bridge, still going up, and follow the Long Path back to the starting point. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesChallenging.html#giantStairs\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/hikesChallenging.html#giantStairs<\/a> and here's the pdf map from that site: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/mapGrayscale.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.njpalisades.org\/pdfs\/mapGrayscale.pdf<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"I'll be by the trail head at noon o'clock","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NorthernNewJerseyFriends\/events\/229556284\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":14400000,"name":"Noon O'Clock Hiking Series: State Line Lookout","id":"229556284","time":1459623600000,"updated":1459687683000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1346031316000,"name":"Northern New Jersey 20s-40s Friends","group_lon":-74.0699996948,"id":4646572,"urlname":"NorthernNewJerseyFriends","group_lat":40.9500007629,"who":"Northern New Jersey Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":45,"headcount":0,"distance":3.4617433548,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457997503000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Are you looking to network and learn how you can start mastering your craft from other creatives and professionals?

Applying his uniquely personal vision, Sokurov paints a fascinating portrait of two real-life characters: the Louvre\u2019s wartime director, Jacques Jaujard, and Count Franziskus Wolff-Metternich, the Nazis\u2019 emissary to the great museum. The movie is a battle of wits between these remarkable art professionals \u2013 enemies, then collaborators \u2013 whose unlikely alliance becomes the driving force behind the preservation of one of the world\u2019s great artistic treasure troves.

The theory behind these events comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group. It's important that our events be fun! So with that in mind, let's get serious about ramping up our enjoyment of life!<\/p> <p>(photo of atrium and location of meetup table)<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/4\/4\/0\/600_433449280.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>(photo of atrium entrance at the corner of 53rd and Lex.)<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/1\/a\/600_365547162.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>At the NE corner of 53rd and Lex., walk down wide steps (see photo) leading to lower outdoor patio.

We don't try to change what's happening in the moment, but we certainly welcome expressions of our desires to do so. It is typically practiced in groups and can focus on relationship with one person the whole time or relationships with many people at indiscriminate times.<\/p> <p>Why do we do it?<\/p> <p>There's something about present-moment relationship with other human beings that helps us to gain more insight into ourselves and each other. That, and such quality attention and connection is nourishing unto itself.\u00a0If you value intimacy in your relationships and\/or seeing aspects of yourself that you're not yet aware of, this practice is for you.<\/p> <p>I'm still not entirely clear on what I'd be getting myself into if I participated, can you tell me more?<\/p> <p>I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about the practice, and you can message me or email me at [masked]. That being said, I fully encourage you to give it a try for yourself and see if it's something you enjoy. We certainly respect everyone's sovereignty and hold no obligations for you to stay for any longer than you'd like to.<\/p> <p>For more information on Circling, visit any of the following pages:\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/integralcenter.org\/what-is-circling\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/integralcenter.org\/what-is-circling\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/integralcenter.org\/what-is-circling\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/circlinginstitute.com\/circling\/what-is-circling\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circlinginstitute.com\/circling\/what-is-circling\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circlinginstitute.com\/circling\/what-is-circling\/<\/a><\/a>\u00a0<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/circlingeurope.com\/about\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circlingeurope.com\/about\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circlingeurope.com\/about\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-Jersey-Circling-Authentic-Relating\/events\/229751159\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":9900000,"name":"Circling Night in Glen Ridge","id":"229751159","time":1459634400000,"updated":1459646433000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1458528036000,"name":"New Jersey Circling & Authentic Relating","group_lon":-74.2200012207,"id":19736849,"urlname":"New-Jersey-Circling-Authentic-Relating","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"39 W. 29th St, #302 (Bwy\/6th Ave)","name":"Big Buddha Yoga Center","lon":-73.992867,"id":24260233,"state":"NY","lat":40.742809,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.520183980465,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458611943000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for a Cuddle Party - an experiential workshop and social event.\u00a0 Where else can you attend a workshop in your pajamas, or yoga clothes.<\/p> <p>To attend you must purchase a ticket in advance.

The tambura is a small and agile plucked instrument similar to the mandolin, occasionally supplemented by wind instruments and accordion. S\u00f6nd\u00f6rg\u0151\u2019s traditional repertoire is made up of material gathered by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Tiham\u00e9r Vujicsics as well as learned from old masters of the tradition.<\/p> <p>S\u00f6nd\u00f6rg\u0151\u2019s\u00a0aim is to foster and preserve the Southern Slavic traditions of the Serbs and Croats as found in various settlements in Hungary.

The PIT Theater's will call is IMMEDIATELY to the left of the main doors.<\/p> <p><br\/>If you have OVERFLOW tickets, then *I* will have your tickets, and I will know the name you gave via PayPal or Square Up. I am the bearded guy who will be wearing Ravenclaw robes. The pre-show waiting area (which is also a bar!) is not very large, so finding me will not be difficult. I will alternate my time from the front of the line to the main theater doors and the will call box office. This distance I will be migrating back and forth from is about 20 feet.<br\/>DOORS: The main doors will open to begin seating into the theater at around 9:30pm. SEATING IS GENERAL ADMISSION EXCEPT FOR OVERFLOW. So the regular ticket holders will be let in first, and once they are seated, the overflow seating will be allowed in. For general seating, since where you sit is pretty much first come first serve, it can't hurt to get in at 9pm or earlier to line up before door open.<\/p> <p><br\/>Those who have discussed special seating needs with me. The box office knows about those needs and the door manager will know, and I will be there in case there are any issues. If your needs require you to be seated earlier, please find me so I know you have arrived and we will make the approriate arrangements.<\/p> <p><br\/>AT THE END OF THE SHOW: I have arranged for a fun group photo with the cast. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR SEATS after the bows. The cast will be coming into the audience to get a huge group photo with us. After that, members of the cast will be come out to the bar to say hello, get photos, sign show programs, etc. Its pretty casual =)<br\/>I hope that covers everything, if you have any questions please let me know via direct message.<\/p> <p><br\/>-------<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nWe have arranged to have exclusive showing of the hysterical comedy PUFFS performed just for The Group That Shall Not Be Named.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPuffs is a comedy about the Hogwarts Hufflepuff house and what happened to them during Harry Potter's years at Hogwarts. It is funny, touching, and brilliant. If you are a Harry Potter fan you cannot miss this show!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/6\/e\/f\/600_444270447.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nTickets are $20 + $1 paypal processing fee.

Lays a foundation for understanding human history.\"\u2015Bill Gates<\/p> <p>In this \"artful, informative, and delightful\" (William H. McNeill,\u00a0New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies,\u00a0Guns, Germs, and Steel\u00a0chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/229890530\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:30 am!","id":"hssxjlyvgbfb","time":1459690200000,"updated":1459701908000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"11102","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Hoyt Avenue","name":"Astoria Park Tennis Courts","lon":-73.920265,"id":14141052,"state":"NY","lat":40.772957,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":5,"distance":3.98744320869,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":1,"created":1459474887000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Park permits required to play.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet by the benches near the court entrance, or look for the posted court assignments in the message section for this event.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Astoria-Park-Tennis\/events\/230034747\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":10800000,"name":"SUNDAY MORNING TENNIS ","id":"230034747","time":1459690200000,"updated":1459717565000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372730402000,"name":"Astoria Park Tennis","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":9177432,"urlname":"Astoria-Park-Tennis","group_lat":40.7700004578,"who":"Astoria Park Tennis Aficionados"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":23.0377674103,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458141165000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>LEADER:\u00a0 Chris Connolly (<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a> (pref.)[masked])<\/b><\/p> <p><b>RATING: B 7 B<\/b><\/p> <p><b>We\u2019ll take the Schuber to loop around the MacMillan Reservoir, than take the Marsn and Yellow\/Silver Trails to lunch view points, and return via Schuber and Silver Trails.

The session starts 10am, running till around 10:45 or 11am. Bring a towel to sit on, and some water to drink. Beginners and experienced meditators welcome. I try to incorporate a range of styles, as different methods suit different people. I practice vipassana (the practice of calm abiding and observing) and qigong (the art of moving the body's energy), which mold quite well together.
