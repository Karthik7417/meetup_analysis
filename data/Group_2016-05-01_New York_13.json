I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I\u2019m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen\u2019s Self Organizing Maps). <\/p>\n<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. <\/p>\n<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in New York. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.<\/p>\n<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have.

Sadly, our previous organizer shut it down on New Year's Day 2016 (despite a stated intention not to do so), thereby wiping out all files, studies, reports, photos, discussions, e-lists, event history... and the entire institutional memory of the group. This represented the collective product of many feminists over a number of years. <br><\/p>\n<p>This valuable resource was created for the benefit of, and was open to, the entire Feminist community, members and non-members alike. It will take some time, but we will rebuild both the site and the collective inclusive spirit of the group. Silence in not an option. <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Please be a feminist or open to feminism if you join<\/b>. There are plenty of other groups to join if you are neither. Beyond that, we welcome feminists of all stripes, colors, creeds, and gender identities who are committed to challenging, confronting, and ultimately dismantling Patriarchy. Together we hope to forge a path to sexual equality and gender justice for all, not just by talking among ourselves, but by speaking out, writing, marching, demonstrating, protesting and actively projecting a loud and fierce voice in opposition to Rape Culture and the War on Women. <br><\/p>\n<p>Male supremacy must end. Oppression and violence is not natural or inevitable. Neither is patriarchy or any collection of interlocking\/intersecting systems of oppression. Radical Feminism, in the truest sense of the word 'Radical', is about going to the root of the systems of oppression that we all participate in and perpetuate, creating change from the ground up and making the world a better,&nbsp; more equitable, non-oppressive place. <br><\/p>\n<p>We believe change is not only possible but probable and above all necessary.

We are currently in the process of starting an Event Planning Expo business and we are currently seeking independent event planning businesses who will be willing to vendor for us. Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo. Thank You for your time and we hope to see you at our meet ups!<\/p> \n<p>Thank You for your time and we look forward to getting to know each and every one of you and hopefully have an opportunity to work with you all!<\/p>","lon":-73.5599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/highres_447715221.jpeg","photo_id":447715221,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/600_447715221.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/7\/b\/5\/thumb_447715221.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":144484202,"name":"Keith","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/highres_252392635.jpeg","photo_id":252392635,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/member_252392635.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/f\/7\/b\/thumb_252392635.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"\"Vend & Attend\" - Long Island Event Planning","id":19245990,"state":"NY","urlname":"Vend-Attend-Long-Island-Event-Planning","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Event Planners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1451321707000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"outdoor-fitness","name":"Outdoor  Fitness","id":15672},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"beginners-running","name":"Beginner's Running","id":24325},{"urlkey":"training-for-fun-runs","name":"Training For Fun Runs","id":32720},{"urlkey":"womens-running","name":"Women's Running","id":37072},{"urlkey":"beginning-running","name":"Beginning Running","id":58293},{"urlkey":"running-trail-walking","name":"Running & Trail Walking","id":68914},{"urlkey":"running-beginning-train-for-a-marathon","name":"Running: Beginning Train for a Marathon","id":82464},{"urlkey":"running-with-friends","name":"Running with Friends","id":92083},{"urlkey":"beginner-runners","name":"Beginner Runners","id":104066},{"urlkey":"beginner-running","name":"Beginner Running","id":158408}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rosedale-Beginning-Running-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"\u201cThis is a group for anyone interested in beginning running, beginning speed walking, etc. All beginners welcome.

Whether you're already in business, just starting a business, or would like to promote it, all types are welcomed!<\/p> \n<p>Planning a wedding or event these days can be a nightmare! Especially when you don't know where to find event planners. You would have to call businesses, have them come to your home or office at a time thats never convenient, find people online without visual aids, etc. The whole idea of this business will be where event planners of all kind can all come together, set up a table, showcase their business, reveal samples and visual aids, hand out business cards, meet clients face-to-face, sell stuff and book events, all at once! We would like this Event Planning Expo to take place at a park in the spring and summer time and at a hotel banquet hall in the fall and winter.<\/p> \n<p>We are looking for the following:<\/p> \n<p>-Photographers<\/p> \n<p>-DJs<\/p> \n<p>-Tent rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Limousine rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Caterers (Sample and sell your own food)<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Gown\/Tuxedo fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding ring fitters<\/p> \n<p>-Party Favor suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Novelty Concession Stands (popcorn, cotton candy, snow cone machines etc.)<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Cream Trucks<\/p> \n<p>-Wedding Cake Designers<\/p> \n<p>-Ice Sculptures<\/p> \n<p>-Florists<\/p> \n<p>-Travel Agents<\/p> \n<p>-Characters (Mascots, Clowns)<\/p> \n<p>-Magicians<\/p> \n<p>-Candy Buffet Suppliers<\/p> \n<p>-Balloon Suppliers\/Balloonists<\/p> \n<p>-Animal show businesses<\/p> \n<p>-Inflatable rentals<\/p> \n<p>-Spray Paint Artists<\/p> \n<p>...Anything Event Planning related!<\/p> \n<p>Our goal for the Expos is to help other businesses promote their own, to make it convenient for people (guests who attend) to plan their own events with as little stress as possible and to also be a place where families and friends can come and have fun! The way you earn money is entirely up to you! Whether it's selling food, booking events with a down payment, selling bracelets for all day access to the moon bouncers for the kids, etc. We would like to hold meet ups at least once a month, so we will have more vendors at each Expo.

I didn't really see any kind of group like this on Meetup, so I thought it'd be cool to have a slightly different video game based group on here!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So this group is exactly what the title might suggest. Our meetups are centered around the great conversations we can have from talking about the games we've been playing as a group! This is meant to be a relaxing, casual get-together where you can meet new people, share a common interest with new friends, and maybe even learn some new things about your favorite game(s)! We encourage that everyone try and play the games we'll be talking about for yourselves but it's okay if you can't either. You might learn about their experiences in ways that you never would have gotten playing it yourself anyway. And we'll be trying to have meetups that can revolve around everyone playing something at the same time as well to spread events around the month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do ask that everyone signing up for the group have a clear picture of themselves on their profile so that we can recognize members for each meetup. I'll be taking suggestions from the sign-up questions on what our games for each month are going to be, and we'll go from there. Other than that, all we ask is that you're ready to have a good time and talk about games with new friends!

We welcome those who are curious and open-minded. We especially welcome people whose significant other is Jewish and who want to know more of what it\u2019s about. Come be part of this growing community, make friends, learn and have fun. Each evening begins with a wine and cheese hour at 7:00pm, and the learning begins at 8:00pm. NightShul Adult Learning Community's January Meetup begins on January 14 at the East Midwood Jewish Center, 1625 Ocean Avenue. Meetup will continue weekly on Thursday evenings through January 28.

It's a lot of fun, and also really cathartic, as we feel into our bodies and touch into the deepest parts of ourselves...igniting bliss and releasing any blocks we might be holding.

All decks need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All armies need to be checked and approved by a group Dungeon Master.&nbsp; This is to ensure that characters and stats are not&nbsp;altered and that characters are&nbsp;using their actual rolled stats and not illegally inflated stats.&nbsp; <strong><em>When the group has more members than space to play, there is going to be a cost of $10.00 a character, $10.00 a deck,&nbsp;and $15.00 an army for registration.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp; Every group member gets to register 3 characters and&nbsp;1 army for free.&nbsp;

I\u2019ve always had fairly good self-esteem and confidence about my body and myself- and wanted the same for others. Of course we\u2019re not going to feel great about ourselves 24\/7, but I want to help more people feel happy, healthy, to love and accept themselves, and to realize how incredible they are. For a long time, I had a narrow view of what it meant to have positive body image- mostly dictated by what society said we should judge ourselves by: a specific beauty ideal, weight, what people thought, and by what we were eating. Throughout my personal evolution, I have learned to grow exponentially stronger in the love for my body and discovered this emerging body positive culture. What initially ignited my fire and determination to add to this important conversation about positive body image is the many women I started to meet post high school struggling with serious body image issues, and although I have not personally suffered, their experiences touched me greatly. What matters to me, and what I want to spread throughout my life- be it with the weights classes, Zumba classes, BollyX classes I teach or Meetups I run- is the importance of inner health -to prevent against disease etc- and that our weight and appearance does not determine our beauty nor worth. I'm clear that loving ourselves and our bodies is the best path to take- not negative self-talk or hate. I want to create a community where women can come and talk about a healthy body image and see themselves in a positive, loving light. Join me and let's talk about what it means for you!

I am grateful to be able to share with you all that I have learned on my own journey to self love!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join me&nbsp;in&nbsp;this powerful group of women as we&nbsp;explore&nbsp;self love, while learning how to connect deeply to your authentic self, the part of you that is desiring to live a powerfully expressed life. There is that small voice that wants to be heard, understood, acknowledged and loved, that part is your authentic self: your soul.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Goldfarb, Licensed Soul Therapist, Spiritual Healer &amp; Guide<\/p>\n<p><b><span>Testimonials:<\/span> <\/b><br><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I had the pleasure of taking Carolyn's \"A Journey To Self Love\" group class and it was amazing! She really gets to the heart of what is blocking you, which makes you see the light on where you have been struggling. Carolyn then provided me with suggestions that I could apply in a practical manner to shift out of my discomfort and struggle. She is very thorough and there is also group interaction and sharing which I really liked. She is an inspiration to all and her guidance has helped us see things in different and better way. I am going to sign up for one of her individual sessions as well. I highly recommend it! - Diane O. New York, NY I recently attended Carolyn's Journey to Self-Love workshop in New York City and had a very transcendent experience. She helped me to look inward at obstacles that have kept me from fully loving and forgiving myself. Carolyn has the innate ability to help people become more aware of their inner soul and how powerful they are as a human being. She also guides the group on how they can connect to their spirit guides which showed me how I am always supported and loved. She creates a space that allows you to feel empowered. <b>- Tania E. Bloomfield NJ<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>***<\/b> I sought Carolyn's expertise to help me get past a \"block\" in my career. Although anxious about the experience, she took a great deal of time to help me understand exactly what was going to happen, how it works and everything in between. She also shared her own PLR experiences so that I felt more comfortable with the process.<\/p>\n<p>Although it's hard to put into words, the experience was transformative and within less than 24 hours, I have a more open heart, mind and a new internal strength. Carolyn truly is a beautiful soul and is passionate about helping others to grow and be happy during this lifetime. If you are looking to understand yourself at a soul level to enjoy a better life, Carolyn can definitely help you get there. I know she hasn't seen the last of me.<b>-<\/b><b>Alexandra B., NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>*** <\/b>If you never met Carolyn, you should!!! Carolyn has an amazing approach to her work as a Soul Therapist and Past Life Regressionist.<\/p>\n<p>Her approach allows you to discover information about yourself that has ultimately been a barrier to your self-growth. Carolyn allows you to identify these barriers in a very short amount of time that enables you to make changes that will facilitate action, personal satisfaction, inner peace and happiness that we are all seeking.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn cares deeply for others and has a gift for engaging you in conversation and connecting you with in a different level that allows you to make the change that you have always wanted to, but could not before. As good as it gets!!! :)<b> - Danielle S..

His novel The Radetzky March, which appeared two years later, is almost universally recognized as a classic. Yet Roth\u2019s earlier work, in which he probingly examined the upheavals of his time\u2014particularly the Russian revolution\u2014have only recently been rediscovered. In the United States, a new anthology of his early reportage, The Hotel Years, has just been published by New Directions, and in Germany his newly published essays on Russia have been celebrated by critics and readers alike. Are we experiencing an international Roth Renaissance? Jan B\u00fcrger and George Prochnik will discuss one of the most important and enigmatic writers of the modern era, and provide insights into his astonishing body of work with the aid of manuscripts and letters from the Leo Baeck Institute, New York, and the German Literature Archive, Marbach. Jan B\u00fcrger is a literary scholar and author. He wrote his dissertation about Hans Henny Jahnn, belongs to the founding editors of the Berlin journal Literaturen, and has worked since 2002 at the German Literature Archive. In addition to numerous contributions to journals and newspapers (including Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he has written Der gestrandete Wal: Das ma\u00dflose Leben des Hans Henny Jahnn (2003), Benns Doppelleben oder wie man sich selbst zusammensetzt (2006), Max Frisch: Das Tagebuch (2011) and Der Neckar: Eine literarische Reise (2013). He is also the editor of a number of events including Ich bin nicht innerlich. Ann\u00e4herungen an Gottfried Benn (2003), Friedrich Schiller: Dichter, Denker, Vor- und Gegenbild (2007), Liebe ist Quatsch. Briefe an Ellinor by Hans Henny Jahnn (with Sandra Hiemer, 2014) Briefwechsel by Alfred Andersch and Max Frisch (2014), as well as Reisen in die Ukraine und nach Russland by Joseph Roth (2015). George Prochnik has written for the The New York Times, The New Yorker, Bookforum and the LA Review of Books.

Now what? Well, there are admirable heroes who can handle cancer diagnoses with grace and compassion; not for themselves solely but mostly for the sake of people around them. They are my idols but I knew from the get-go that I am absolutely not yet one of them. I want to scream, throw a tantrum, kicking up like a baby while whining and sobbing and swearing on the floor. I don't act like this all the time though because it requires a bit physical strength. Never less, I believe that we, the ordinary people, have the right to react to cancer however we wish to, and those superheroes need a break every now and then too. So I started this group with one goal in mind- for my fellow cancer carriers to be openly emotional, freely expressional, and swear at cancer until we exhausted all dirty words we know, then we go shopping and eating and dancing like no tomorrow. And then, we gather ourselves and get on with our ordinary life and live as healthy as one can be, until the next meetup. :)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>Yup, our menu includes screaming exercise (a.k.a Friday night dance club), anger management (a.k.a boxing with the cute gym coach), stress release exercise (a.k.a swearing phrase spelling bee, crying competition), group field trips (e.g. reiki, craniosacral therapy, princess spa, hair shedding shower, wig fitting party), and world peace, seriously (a.k.a trips around the USA and the world to drag our fellow cancer carriers out of their shells or their superhero masks, and share a lot of FUN and SHIT dealing with cancer!

In other words, CHANGES is my best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Over the last couple of years, I've been involved in the transformation of others' lives through Accomplishment Coaching and Landmark.&nbsp;I created '2nd Chance, 2nd Life' because&nbsp;I believe we deserve a 2nd chance to&nbsp;live the life that we love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I'm here to<\/span><span>&nbsp;support people to embrace major changes in their lives (e.g. cancer, relocation, career changing, starting a business) and to empower their choice (or the lack of it).&nbsp;<\/span><span>We will&nbsp;have activities that will generate&nbsp;light, love, connection and strength, together. <\/span><span>You will create and experience&nbsp;the connection and love with self, others and our lives, <\/span><span>with power,&nbsp;<\/span><span>by design.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Come out and join us at our next 2nd Chance, 2nd Life event.

Sometimes it's intimidating to go to a group activity all by yourself. Or sometimes you get lost in a big group event \u2013 you talk to everyone but get to know no one. Wouldn't it be nice to have a date at a fun event?<\/p>\n<p>With our activities, you're welcome to come alone or with a date. And if you need a date, visit HowAboutADate.com. (1) post a date - what, when, &amp;amp; where, (2) review replies, (3) choose your date and go out. Dating Simplified! Do what you love... and love will find you.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, this is a different Meetup group \u2013 it combines great activities with (optionally) bringing a date for that activity. We simply want you to have a great time (i.e. enjoy fun dates not \"interview dates\" or high pressure dates). And feel free to suggest great \"first date\" activities and even post links to other great meetup events. We're not here to compete with other meetups, only to support and enrich the Singles Community!<\/p>\n<p>There is no age requirement for our group, except that you're over 18 of course. Our members range from 20 to 70 y.o. We're all about making friends first and enjoying the company of others and doing wonderful activities throughout New York and the surrounding areas.

She was a child prodigy at the Paris Conservatory who worked with four famous French composers: Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, and Maurice Ravel (we have information in the French School archives to validate this).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Mlle. Combe won first place in a competition in the Paris Conservatory at age 13. When she played for Debussy, he conceded her interpretation of one of his pieces&nbsp;<\/span>improved<span>&nbsp;it so much that he instructed his&nbsp;<\/span>publisher<span>&nbsp;to make certain changes to his printed work in the next printing. She performed Saint-Sa\u00ebns' second concerto with Saint-Sa\u00ebns conducting the orchestra, at age 15 in 1907. That same year, though, she fractured her wrist in a bike accident. Because it was improperly set, she had to give up her budding career as a solo concert pianist and turned to teaching, setting up her first school in Switzerland.&nbsp;<\/span><span>It was Sergey Rachmaninov who advocated to the US State Department that she be allowed to emigrate to the US to bring solfege to this country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Through Claude Debussy, the lineage of musicality continues up through Franz Liszt, Carl Czerny, and Ludwig van Beethoven (you can Google this in the Wikipedia pages). So former students of Mlle. Combe and her students (including Stephen Waters and more) are musical descendants of these famous composers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was Mlle. Combe's piano student from 1972 - 1982 and performed at Carnegie Recital Hall nine times as a child. My little sister performed there ten times, and many of my classmates did as well. Alumni during the 1970s who went professional musically have worked with Zubin Mehta and Constance Keene, studied at Juilliard (seven classmates that I know of including myself) and other conservatories (five that I know of), and become worldwide concertizing artists, professors at conservatories, resident composers and artists. One alumna after my time is now a professional singer who has sung in many famous movies.<\/p>\n<p>Those alumni during my time who did not become professional musicians became doctors, lawyers, technologists (like myself), entrepreneurs, executives, educators, etc. Some crossed over, becoming professional performers and entrepreneurs \/ technologists. It turns out we didn't just learn about music. We learned about discipline, self-control, attention to detail, perseverance, standards of excellence, and how to pick ourselves up and continue on when we ran into challenges. These are universally valuable skills that affect every aspect of one's life - personally and professionally.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds intimidating, doesn't it? Here's the thing: were we a bunch of freaky Mozart genius kids?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Oh heck no.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What happened was that we were given wildly efficient and effective piano practice methods, solfege lessons to develop our understanding of music, and insights from a teacher who knew exactly what the French composers intended with their compositions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those of us who are part of the French School of Music family were given an extraordinary opportunity, and we fully intend to pass along what we learned from Mlle. Combe. Our mission is to ensure that future generations of music students have the same opportunity that we had, including adding their names to an amazing musical lineage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We welcome all who are passionate about music, who want to learn better piano practice techniques, and learn how solfege can help you build a solid musical foundation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>- Eileen Chang Sauer<\/p>\n<p>French School of Music <br>210 W 8th Street <br>Plainfield, NJ&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>(908) 757-3087<span> <br><\/span><\/span><span>info@frenchschoolofmusic.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Resources:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.frenchschoolofmusic.com\">French School website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/French-School-of-Music-710622825625877\/\">French School Facebook page<\/a>, which includes historical artifacts and photos from French School, recordings of recitals, as well as video of Carnegie Recital Hall performances and trophy ceremonies in the 1970s.<\/p>\n<p>My dad's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pianopractice.org\">piano practice book<\/a>, capturing Mlle.

Appearances and surface beliefs will not be judged. I only wish that everyone joins with the intent to learn and grow, in the name of God.

Everyone is willing to practice with each other and with a Mandrain Chinese native speaker. I teach Chinese 15+ years, and graduated from the\u201cChinese Teacher Training Program\u201din 2008. You should be able to speak and understand at least a little Chinese or you won't be able to participate the conversation. In this Meetup, every week I choose a different topic as a starting point for our conversation. I will post the topic on each Meetup page at least one day before the Meetup. If there is more than one meeting in a week, it will be the same topic, you can try once again or attend next week for the new topic. I will use part of textbooks or media videos to help discuss. RSVP required. RSVP closed the day before every meetup. Min. 2 people, max. 10 people per Meetup (+ me). RSVPs are final: RSVP only if you can come. If something comes up and you can't make it please change your RSVP to \"no\" so I know who is coming. All meeting will be around Middle East Manhattan. But if you recommend some nice places as well, please do tell me. ---- What's more, there are 3 kinds of Chinese classes that I can offer: -Business: focus on the field that you work in. -Travelling: training of the communication of daily life. -Specialize\/Academic Conference: shortly translation, speech training,etc. For private lessons please contact me personally.

Within this work, we access the deeper aspects of our true nature and start the journey of inherently trusting our intuitive sense. This sense of trust not only manifests within the practice, but also permeates throughout the rest of our lives. This kind of attention to the body changes the way we habitually think and react. It encourages us to develop the skills of deep listening, witnessing, and compassion with our inner selves as well as with others. The beauty of this practice is that it can be practiced by anyone with a willingness to show up and be present. There\u2019s no need to be a \u201cdancer\u201d or an \u201cartist\u201d or etc. By simply showing up and being present, so much work has already been done.

Welcome the word\u2019s first drinking club dedicated to bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats. Ideally, this Meetup aims to foster meaningful political discussions\u2014and hopefully camaraderie\u2014between people with opposing viewpoints. At the very least, it hopes to bring together people who share an interest in American politics. In order for this Meetup to be successful, we must keep these goals in mind:<\/p>\n<p>1. In order to generate interesting discussions, we need a mix of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Preaching to the choir is not as fun\u2014or as constructive\u2014as debating issues. Consequently, since New York City is majority-Democrat, reaching out to non-liberals is a priority.<\/p>\n<p>2. We need good topics to discuss at every Meetup. Topics can be specific or general. Possible topics include: privately-funded healthcare vs. publically-funded healthcare, interventionism vs. isolationism, conservatism vs. mainstream republicanism, Bernie vs. Hillary, Trump vs. the establishment, pragmatism vs. idealism, deportation vs. path to citizenship, flat tax vs. graduated tax, security vs. privacy, mental health reform vs. gun control, voter fraud vs. voter suppression, gerrymandering, student loans, the death penalty, women in combat, the pay gap, drug policy, welfare, the minimum wage, labor unions, education policy, terrorism, Israel, Iran, Syria\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3. We need to be able to respectfully discuss our differences. We\u2019ll see whether alcohol helps or hinders achievement of this goal.<\/p>\n<p>4. We need to not ONLY talk about politics. We also want to get to know each other and make new friends. Alcohol will definitely prove helpful in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>5. We need to welcome people of various knowledge levels. Those with a lot of knowledge need to be both teachers and debaters.<\/p>\n<p><span>More to come!

That's it. No speed dating, speaker series, Bible study, joint socials with non-Catholic groups, or anything else. There are other Catholic groups that have those things covered. But unlike those groups, this group will not be tied to any particular parishes. We will get to experience Mass in as many Catholic churches as we can, as many different neighborhoods as we can, even as the number of Catholic churches in New York dwindles. Many of these churches have amazing stories to tell down through the generations.<\/p>\n<p>This is neither a liberal nor conservative Catholic group so please keep politics out of it. I'm most interested in meeting my fellow Catholic single young and not-so-young-anymore (20s, 30s, 40s) adults, but all ages are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the words of Pope Francis in mind: \"...big cities are a reminder of the hidden riches present in our world: in the diversity of its cultures, traditions and historical experiences.

Even if you do not want to take a class, feel free to contact me with questions about the German culture and language. I offer conversation and grammar classes for adult and children groups of different language levels. <br>Usually I rent out spaces either in Manhattan and Brooklyn for the conversation classes to provide a more private and quite environment, especially for beginners and ,of course, children. So locations will be announced as soon as I know where most students are located.<\/p>\n<p>Every student is unique and therefore, my individual classes are easier to structure in a manner to enhance their strengths, while advancing their deficiencies.

With this method we can \u201cdiagnose\u201d and make visible the patterns and blockages which have followed us from the past. The most healing approach to those traumas is not to run away and to forget, but to bring them out. Like the vampire that disintegrates into dust when brought out to the sun \u2013 the traumatic story, when brought out to the conscious level, stops programming our behavior and becomes a valuable experience and knowledge. This practice will give you a chance to work on your personal problems and to serve as a helper in other people\u2019s constellations. The experience of participating in somebody else's constellation gives you deep knowledge of the family relationship structure. This practice brings valuable wisdom to the participant, opens their heart and vision. The Family Constellation method effectively addresses: \u2022 relationship problems \u2022 career issues \u2022 business and financial difficulties \u2022 bodily pain and illness \u2022 depression \u2022 habitual emotional and behavioral patterns When we experience depression, emotional instability, problems with our relationship or career, a common practice is to search for an answer within the realm of our own views and personal history. However, in some cases these issues arise not from personal history, but from our ancestral memories - from the traumas which happened several generations before us. We perceive such traumas as an atmosphere of pressure, danger or threat which affects our feelings and actions. A person with a traumatized \u201cfamily field\u201d intuitively feels that his\/her family energy is too \u201cheavy\u201d and rejects it, putting a barrier between them and their family energy. In a case like this the negative energies are partially blocked, but the power of the family and ancestors\u2019 blessings are blocked as well. In order to move forward you need to feel safety at your back. It is not easy to understand and heal wounds which came from the past. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what happened generations ago. If we do know some stories we feel they are not too important \u2013 we see them as grandmother\u2019s tales of the far past. Those traumas manifest as a tense and heavy atmosphere in our relationships with parents, spouses or kids. They can also manifest as repeated patterns of events in our life.

The energy that lies in the sacrum bone area is the reflection of peace, happiness, bliss and joy that gets awakened with the help of sahaja meditation, goes through six energy centers and passes through fontanel bone area. Fontanel bone was the soft bone on the top of our head when we were babies gets calcified when our ego and superego develops. When the energy passes through fontanel bone, we enter into state of thoughtless awareness. This state brings our attention into present. Our thoughts start to slow down and we feel cool breeze flowing from our both hands and top of head. This experience is called \" Self-realization\". \n\nTop reasons you should do Sahaja meditation:\n\n1. It is Free of Charge. \n\nBecause It's Priceless :-) This energy is already within you, we just help you to rise it. Thus, it is ABSOLUTELY free of charge.\n\n2. It is simple and easy.\n\nDo not need to do much. Just 10 to 15 minutes twice a day everyday. \n\n3. Anyone can do it.\n\nJust need pure desire in your heart and it starts flowing. \n\n4. Scientifically proven and accepted worldwide.\n\nRefer to the links that we provided below for scientific articles. It is accepted in many countries around the world. \n\n5. Become integrated in your life.\n\nThis meditation will help bring your physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual being into balance. \n\nFollowing is the link you can go to and get more info on sahaja meditation and its locations:\n\nwww.sahajameditation.com\n\nThis meditation is scientifically proven and has helped many people with various diseases and disorders.

We are love, we are grace, we are one with everything in creation. Please come and celebrate who you are in a community of loving, light -filled beautiful souls. When we gather together to share in oneness, each of us is raised and anchored into our awareness of unity consciousness and the unconditional love that informs all of creation. And when that happens, we come home to our true nature and our lives and our perceptions are enriched and expanded. The energy of our gatherings is a very high frequency and you will leave feeling empowered, expanded, peaceful and knowing you are grace and love.

It's a conversation.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. \"Can I say anything I want?\"&nbsp;<\/b> <br>-Absolutely.

Your work day is 12 hours with commuting. You sleep maybe 6 hours a night. The rest of the time is taking care of the kids, spouse, dog, cat, partner, laundry, shopping, cleaning and a few other errands that you've been putting off for weeks. How do you fit one hour of exercise a day into that schedule? You don't. That's why a few pounds accumulate each year right after the holidays that you can't seem to get off before summer. This group is about 15 minute workouts that get results (indoors and out). Nutrition tips that you can actually do. Work smarter and more efficiently without spinning your wheels.

This work is based on the simple physics of vulnerability: If we are brave enough, often enough, we will fall. What does that mean? We all have a story about an experience; a situation, a conversation that made us feel bad, sad, hurt, and ashamed. It can be a story of personal heartbreak, a story from our childhood, a relationship and\/or a professional struggle. It's the story where we think we are not good enough; smart enough, thin enough, or even not worthy of being loved. That we\u2019re a bad friend, parent, spouse, boss, son, or daughter. When we don't resolve these feelings, they stop us from having courage in our day-to-day lives. Who should take this workshop? This work is for anyone that wants to: - Explore a story of struggle - Get curious about the emotions that keep us stuck in our story - Learn how owning our story of struggle gives us the power to write a brave new ending How does Rising Strong work? The work is broken down into three acts and is facilitated through discussion, video and written exercises. Act I: The Reckoning \u2013 We Walk Into Our Story. Act II: The Rumble \u2013 Owning Our Story. Act III: The Revolution \u2013 Process Becomes Practice. We write a new ending to our story based on our key learnings and use this new, braver story to change how we engage with the world and to ultimately transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead","lon":-73.9700012207,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":106571132,"name":"Susan G.

It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.&nbsp; <br> <br>Here are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt&nbsp; <br>\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity&nbsp; <br> <br><b>What is Sahaja Meditation?&nbsp;<\/b> <br> <br>How does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.&nbsp; <br> <br>How does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.&nbsp; <br> <br>Once awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Overview.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> The primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.&nbsp; <br> <br>If you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.&nbsp; <br> <br>Ultimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.&nbsp; <br> <br>There's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>The power of collective meditation<\/b>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Collective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone. <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-73.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":12422128,"name":"Alan Wherry","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/highres_253437724.jpeg","photo_id":253437724,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/member_253437724.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/e\/1\/7\/c\/thumb_253437724.jpeg"}},"members":69,"name":"Meditation Classes, Kingsbridge NYPL, Bronx - Always Free","id":19471790,"state":"NY","urlname":"Meditation-Kingsbridge-Library-Bronx-Always-Free","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1454218552000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"smallbiz","name":"Small Business","id":389},{"urlkey":"blackbiz","name":"Black Professionals","id":2494},{"urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology","id":9696},{"urlkey":"business-referral-networking","name":"Business Referral Networking","id":15405},{"urlkey":"women-entrepreneurs","name":"Women Entrepreneurs","id":15497},{"urlkey":"black-entrepreneurs","name":"Black Entrepreneurs","id":16348},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"small-business-owners","name":"Small Business Owners","id":20743},{"urlkey":"womens-business-networking","name":"Women's Business Networking","id":21283},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"women-small-business-owners","name":"Women Small Business Owners","id":23633},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"venture-capital","name":"Venture Capital","id":38968},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Women-Minority-Business-MWBE-Train-Bid-Sell-Contract-Career\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Thank you for your interest in this new community of minority, women, and other diversity group members who are either currently or seeking to become a \u201d government certified (M\/WBE) business enterprise, and\/ or simply desiring to explore other methodologies of business capitalization, growth, utilizing tech and new media to develop new business and career opportunities. <br><\/p>\n<p>Note, that City, State, and Federal government agencies are required by law to award a certain annual percentage of their contracts to Certified M\/WBE business enterprises.

Relax. It's Easy. Whether you are looking for a practical method to handle stress, a life too full of priorities, or for insights into the meaning of life, into spiritual growth, this will help. \n\nSahaja Yoga Meditation is unique in ways too numerous to explain here. Unlike other forms of meditation or yoga, this is not something you \"do\" - it is more about a state of becoming, of \"being\" rather than doing, a living process that transforms your life from within.\n\nClasses are:\n\nled by experts, with thousands of hours of practical experience, deep knowledge and skill. In addition, there are often people training to become instructors who are happy to offer individual guidance. \n\ntailored to the needs of the attendees. A starter session will be given if there are newcomers. New techniques and insights are always available for regulars. Advanced techniques will also be explored.\n\nno more than an hour. Not long, considering the benefits can last a lifetime. They begin with a brief introduction followed by 40-50 minutes of instruction, and meditation practice.\n\nWhat Sahaja Meditation Can Do For You\n\nSahaja Meditation is good for heart, mind, body and soul. It's all about energy \u2014 Kundalini Energy \u2014 and everyone has it. Sahaja Meditation is a simple technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself \u2014 emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's easy. Anyone can do it.  \n\nHere are just a few specific benefits Sahaja Meditation offers\u2026  \n\u2022 Immediate stress relief and long-term stress management  \n\u2022 Improve physical and emotional health and boost long-term resilience  \n\u2022 Improve overall personality and relationships  \n\u2022 Balance personal and professional responsibilities  \n\u2022 Take control of your life; control negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, guilt  \n\u2022 Improve cognitive functioning: focus, clarity, decision-making and problem-solving skills, enhanced creativity  \n\nWhat is Sahaja Meditation?  \n\nHow does Sahaja Meditation differ from other popular forms of meditation? On the surface, Sahaja Meditation has a lot in common with other forms of meditation. But what's unique to Sahaja is the ability to awaken and connect to your Kundalini Energy and influence the movement of this energy up through your body's seven primary energy centers known as chakras, to achieve physical and emotional well-being and ultimately establish a spiritual connection.  \n\nHow does energy flow work? It flows through each of your energy centers or chakras, energizing, nurturing and balancing them. Think of your Inner Energy system as a flute with seven holes \u2014 each hole representing a chakra, and your inner energy representing the air that is blown through the flute. If the flute's holes are unobstructed, the flute can produce melodious, harmonious music in the hands of a skilled musician. And so it is with your chakras. When they're clear and free of obstructions, your inner energy flows through your body smoothly, achieving a harmonious balance.  \n\nOnce awakened, you'll find that Sahaja Meditation makes it easy to meditation effortlessly. Most forms of meditation don't allow you to easily actualize the energy on Day 1. The reason is that Sahaja Meditation has the unique ability to achieve the powerful state of thoughtless awareness, quickly and effortlessly. What is thoughtless awareness? Think of it as purified attention, a state of maximum energy flow during which your mind is calmed and gradually emptied of all distractions and negative thoughts and feelings. Sahaja Meditation techniques allow you to extend that fraction-of-a-second gap between one thought and the next to remain in a thoughtless state for as long as you wish. Thoughtless awareness is a much-needed break from the thoughts that constantly bombard us all day long.  \n\nOverview.\n\nThe primary focus of Sahaja Meditation classes, especially for beginners, is awakening and experiencing the energy with the goal of achieving thoughtless awareness. We'll provide a brief overview of the subtle energy system so that you can understand the sensations you feel within your body and correlate your experience to real physical and mental attributes. But experience is always valued over knowledge. In other words, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, not in learning how to make elaborate pudding recipes or discussing how wonderful the pudding tastes.  \n\nIf you continue to practice Sahaja Meditation, you'll discover and experience, step by step, your own energy centers and their associated qualities. Once you're able to consistently feel the energy and have experienced noticeable differences in your cognitive and emotional states, you can explore more advanced techniques, such as clearing and healing the chakras. You'll learn how the energy centers play a vital role in our evolutionary process of becoming better human beings and experience holistic improvement on all planes \u2014 physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual. In the ultimate and most advanced phases, you may choose to use Sahaja Meditation to discover your inner spiritual self and how you can evolve to higher realms of spirituality. For many, Sahaja is much more than just a temporary solution or quick relief. It is a journey, rather than a destination.  \n\nUltimately, Sahaja classes can provide a complete course on meditation and spirituality, which you can continue to experiment with and verify at every step. Just as no two life experiences are exactly alike, no two Sahaja Meditation experiences are exactly alike. You can explore at your own pace, in your own way. There are no rules, restrictions or rituals. Sahaja is entirely Do-It-Yourself. And we are always available to help.  \n\nThere's no pressure to continue attending classes. You can come once or twice and never come back again or you can attend classes weekly. Many find that attending classes weekly is just what they need to recharge their batteries.  \n\nThe power of collective meditation. \n\nCollective meditation in an optimized environment can be exhilarating and rejuvenating. In fact, generally, the larger the group, the better the experience. Collective meditation is also likely to help you progress faster in the initial weeks, as compared to meditating at home, alone.
