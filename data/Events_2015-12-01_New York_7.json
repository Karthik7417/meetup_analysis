We will examine proven approaches to transforming our lives for the better while raising our level of consciousness.<\/p> <p><b>GOOD NEWS\/BAD NEWS<\/b><\/p> <p>Studies reveal that most people endure life in a state of almost constant inexplicable melancholy. An enigmatic sadness and tiredness, defeated and overwhelmed. Despite occasional \u201chighs\u201d, life seems to have passed them by. They no longer dream big dreams. They no longer aspire to greatness. They seldom live in the \u201cnow\u201d. They usually wait for some future event to lighten the load. Deep down they no longer believe that true happiness can be theirs.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s some of the bad news. But it gets worse. If you dare suggest to them that it is THEIR thoughts and actions that attract what and who come into their life, they are likely to get upset and argue that you just don\u2019t understand the circumstances of their life. And in their mind, they are SURE that they are right and you are wrong.<\/p> <p>The good news is that Eastern philosophies, Western research and Judaic sources all confirm that with a little effort and training, we can transform our lives and literally become a new person. The Jewish concept of Teshuva deals with this topic extensively. But there are other teachings, meditation techniques and\u00a0visualization exercises that can help one become the person they were intended to be. That person is intrinsically whole and pure and possesses unlimited potential.<\/p> <p>In our next series of MeetUps, we will explore Jewish meditation practices and previously seldom revealed visualization exercises.\u00a0 We are confident that you will feel a difference after only one meeting.\u00a0 But if you make the commitment to come to all our meetings, you will discover a transformative change in you and those you attract into your life.\u00a0 Our Creator wants to shower us with happiness, bliss and abundance. \u00a0He has given us a blueprint for how to attract His blessings.\u00a0 Let\u2019s review the blueprint together, raise our level of consciousness and awareness, and help each other achieve more of our unlimited potential.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Feel free to bring up to two friends.\u00a0 But please let us know in advance if you are bringing guests.\u00a0 Thank you!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jewish-Spiritual-Seekers\/events\/226663170\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Introduction to Jewish Meditation, Visualization and Prayer","id":"226663170","time":1447893900000,"updated":1447968334000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1359403330000,"name":"Jewish Spiritual Seekers","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":6899542,"urlname":"Jewish-Spiritual-Seekers","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Jersey City","address_1":"189 Brunswick St, 3rd Floor","name":"Jersey City Ballroom","lon":-74.050415,"id":23771336,"state":"NJ","lat":40.726357,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":9,"distance":3.5673854351,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436806309000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Shake it up with some NY style Salsa!

This 1948 family run restaurant is one of the best French restaurants in the theater district and has been a regular for our group for many years. As in years past, they are willing to help us celebrate another November tradition, one that falls on the third Thursday of the month- Beaujolais Nouveau Day. When it first started in the Beaujolais region of France in 1937 it was actually on the 15th of December, but now at 12:01am on the third Thursday of each November, from little villages and towns across this region, millions of cases of Beaujolais Nouveau begin their journey to Paris for immediate shipment to all parts of the world: \u201cLe Beaujolais Nouveau est arriv\u00e9!\u201d By the time it is over, 65 million bottles, nearly half of the region's total annual production, will be distributed around the world. The Gamay grapes (the only grapes permitted to be used in production), by law must be picked by hand (only Champagne shares this requirement too), and must come from the Beaujolais AOC. Beaujolais Nouveau is intended for immediate drinking, as it doesn't improve with age and is best served slightly chilled. This fresh and fruity red is the result of a quick fermentation process that ends up with a tasty, clean wine that is enjoyed by palates all over the world. The most well-known producer is Georges Duboeuf, who is credited as one of the marketing geniuses behind the wine. Selling this young red was viewed by some vintners as a means to clear large quantities of wine at decent profits, which would create a much-needed cash flow shortly after harvest. As we know, it has become a worldwide race to be the first to try this new wine after the harvest and we will be drinking it all night at our dinner- the FIRST day it arrives! Our traditional French menu includes moules mariniere, pate maison, boeuf bourguignon, saumon provencale, coq au vin, hanger steak, creme caramel, mousse au chocolat, tarte tatin or crem brulee.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup\/events\/226567583\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Tout Va Bien","id":"226567583","time":1447973100000,"updated":1447985142000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431373701000,"name":"Over 45+ New York Dinner Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":18590381,"urlname":"Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446141657000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This month, we're thrilled to welcome:<\/p> <p>\u2022 <b>Ryan Bubinski<\/b>, cofounder and CTO of <b>Codecademy<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u2022\u00a0Rob Spectre<\/b>, head of developer evangelism at <b>Twilio<\/b>: <i>SMS for Humans:\u00a0Using NLP and Python To Build Text Interfaces<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/><b>\u2022 David Mauro, <\/b>lead iOS developer at <b>BuzzFeed: <\/b><i>Unpacking\u00a0<\/i><i>Mattress, A Framework for Offline Caching on iOS<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Code Driven NYC\u00a0features fascinating technical and organizational talks from experienced engineers and leaders.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a developer-only audience\u00a0(i.e., no recruiters, etc.) and it is completely free to join and attend.\u00a0Join us for an evening where all attendees are active software developers, with food\/drink\/networking before and after great speakers, and excellent conversations about development and engineering.<\/p> <p><br\/>Schedule: doors open &amp; networking begins at 5:45pm; talks begin at 6:15pm; networking continues at about 7:30pm.<\/p> <p><i>Code Driven NYC is organized by FirstMark, an early stage venture capital firm based in New York City.

Constructed from found objects, his complex collage-drawings, intimately challenge greed, obsessive consumption, and the social stratification of American culture. Hinojosa received his BFA from Parsons School of Design and was awarded residencies at both the Vermont Studio Center and Aljira Center for Contemporary Art. His acceptance into the first New York Foundation for the Arts \u201cArtist Boot Camp\u201d in 2010 led to an interview in the New York Times. Hinojosa\u2019s exhibitions include Queens Museum of Art (New York), the 2011 biennial at El Museo del Barrio (New York), and a solo exhibition at Allegra LaViola Gallery (New York).<\/p> <p>\"The glamorization of wealth and power via fashion magazines and television can cast a spell on just about anyone. Growing up in a low-income family, the desire to have more then you could afford became a constant struggle. This led to my obsession with high-end goods, superheroes, and geometrical symmetry. As I go around the city collecting discard items related to these influences I re-purpose them as a tool to draw with. \" - Juan Hinojosa<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Located at Materials for the Arts.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Materials-for-the-Arts-Events\/events\/225930731\/","yes_rsvp_count":42,"duration":7200000,"name":"Third Thursday Artist Workshop","id":"225930731","time":1447975800000,"updated":1447985519000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1444166616000,"name":"Materials for the Arts Events","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":19002712,"urlname":"Materials-for-the-Arts-Events","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0.692301332951,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446492967000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/men-8\/events\/226491874\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Enjoy good company and good conversation...","id":"226491874","time":1447975800000,"updated":1447988029000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1162840233000,"name":"The NY 60+ mens social network","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":360206,"urlname":"men-8","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Men"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"153 East 53th Street","name":"Citigroup Center: lower level Atrium","lon":-73.97048,"id":701175,"state":"NY","lat":40.758217,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.17122232914,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1308862006000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is an opportunity to practice Japanese conversation, and discuss and study the grammar, particles, Kanji, and culture.

As a society, we devour countless cooking shows, culinary magazines and foodie blogs. So how could we possibly be throwing nearly 50% of it in the trash? Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of food waste. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery shopping cold turkey and survive only on foods that has been discarded. In a nation where one in ten people is food insecure, the images they capture of squandered groceries are both shocking and strangely compelling.\u00a0 <b>Just Eat It <\/b>looks at our systemic obsession with expiry dates, perfect produce and portion sizes, and reveals the core of this seemingly insignificant issue that is having devastating consequences around the globe.

Now, an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.\"<\/p> <p>(after this, I think I will make the executive decision to hold off on sci-fi\/spaceship books for a while!)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club\/events\/226259100\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"duration":5400000,"name":"November Book Club - Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie","id":"226259100","time":1447977600000,"updated":1447983914000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1315347100000,"name":"NYC Girl Geek Adventure Club","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":2444702,"urlname":"NYC-Girl-Geek-Adventure-Club","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10017","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"871 United Nations Plaza","address_2":"First Avenue at 49th Street","name":"German Consulate General","lon":-73.967059,"id":1272111,"state":"NY","lat":40.753189,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.22300076485,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446754930000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/c\/2\/c\/600_443876364.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>On Thursday, November 19th at 7:30pm, German International School New York will host an Information Evening at the German Consulate General of New York for prospective Manhattan parents whose children will enter pre-kindergarten (3s and 4s) and kindergarten (5s) in September 2016.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The evening is an opportunity to meet the Head of School and Head of Lower School, speak with current parents and faculty members, and discover how your child can benefit from GISNY's academically exceptional pre-kindergarten to grade 12, bilingual, college preparatory program.\u00a0<\/p> <p>GISNY welcomes families of all nationalities who are united by their interest in German language and German, Austrian and Swiss cultures and who recognize the distinct advantages of bilingualism and biliteracy in an increasingly competitive, interconnected world.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are no languages requirements for application to the Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes.<\/p> <p><br\/>FREE EVENT: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gisny.org\/RelId\/606458\/ISvars\/default\/Admissions.htm\">Please RSVP Here<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group\/events\/226572475\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"German International School NY: Information Evening","id":"226572475","time":1447977600000,"updated":1447989521000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1325706674000,"name":"CityKinder Manhattan","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3044732,"urlname":"CityKinder-New-York-Meetup-Group","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"28 W 32nd, 3rd Floor","name":"Gagopa","lon":-73.987099,"id":24164347,"state":"NY","lat":40.747578,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":0.226393684745,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445433935000,"fee":{"amount":25,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Going to Korea Town for Karaoke is something every true New Yorker needs to do.............................

Realizing this phenomenon had not been discussed by psychologists of the day, he set out to describe his observations using the classical formalization of Buridan's ass. Lamport initially failed to have this paper published in various scientific journals, being rejected on grounds of superficiality. It wasn't until 2011, when a reader suggested he resubmit to Foundations of Physics, that the paper was eventually published.<\/p> <p>Those familiar with the works of Lamport know him as a logician, his life's work has pushed forward the state of the art in areas of mutual exclusion and distributed systems probably more than any other, and so reading Buridan's Principle might strike us as a bit odd, or even obscure. We're in unfamiliar territory with Lamport. Nonetheless, in this paper, Lamport's casual observations lead him to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, providing us readers with what appears to be a universal law of nature: Buridan's Principle.\u00a0<\/p> <p>[0] <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/um\/people\/lamport\/pubs\/glitch.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/um\/people\/lamport\/pubs\/glitch.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/um\/people\/lamport\/pubs\/glitch.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Bio<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/michaelrbernste.in\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/tomasp.net\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>Tom Santero (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tsantero\">@tsantero<\/a>) is a Software Engineer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helium.com\">Helium Systems<\/a>, writing Haskell and Erlang to connect things to the internet.

I am cool with a young manager who runs the wine bar. The people who work there are really nice and attentive. So for those you who enjoy the taste of wine this is a nice place to visit.

Where have you wanted to move forward but haven't yet figured out how? What have you tried? You'll get to hear what challenges other Self-Lovers have and what they've tried? (You'll see how you're not alone; many of us face similar challenges.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>After our exploration of the ways we're being held back from the lives we want to live, in Part 2 of our Meetup, if you've ever been curious about the coaching process and want to experience (or simply observe*) how powerful it can be, then this is the Meetup for you.<\/p> <p>*Participation is purely voluntary. You're more than welcome to simply observe (you'll get a lot out of that, as well).\u00a0<\/p> <p>I will ask for volunteers and we will do brief one-on-one coaching sessions to help you dig deep within yourself, uncover the hidden blocks, and tapping into your own Inner Wisdom, come away with the next step to move you forward.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Then, if there's time, we'll get into pairs (again, only if you choose to, otherwise you can observe the pairs), and I will supply you with a few empowering questions and you can practice coaching each other (the added benefit is that you'll also come away with some knowledge on how to powerfully coach yourself).<\/p> <p>Come prepared to take some positive and concrete steps towards making 2016 the best year ever. Remember, this will be the last Meetup in 2015.

Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.<\/p> <p>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.\"<br\/><\/i><br\/>I moved the meeting up a week due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

When he finishes, he sees a beautiful girl outside the window. He chases after her. This establishes Jimmy's nature. He is full of passion and can channel it in any number of directions. What will happen if he can't channel that passion? Jimmy's gangster father enlists his help in picking up payments. Simultaneously, Jimmy is practicing for a Carnegie Hall audition. The film, which barely has a plot, is an examination of Jimmy slowly becoming psychologically undone because of the pressures from both the outside world and his internal intensity.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/james-toback-p114247\">James Toback<\/a>'s script sets the audience up for Jimmy's instability. His institutionalized mother, his violent father, and his passionate nature all work together to create a portrait of a man slowly losing his grip. In addition to the beautifully structured script,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/keitel-p37381\">Keitel<\/a>\u00a0is willing and capable of making viewers believe the character. In one early scene, Jimmy is sitting in a restaurant playing a radio very loudly. A man asks him to turn the noise down.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/keitel-p37381\">Keitel<\/a>, with a sinister smile on his face, explains to the man that the song is one of the most innovative rock songs of all time. Jimmy is brimming with the desire to deck the man.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/keitel-p37381\">Keitel<\/a>\u00a0captures the fervent, violent, and tumultuous inner life of the character.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/toback-p114247\">Toback<\/a>\u00a0utilizes many of the same filmmaking techniques\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/martin-scorsese-p110533\">Martin Scorsese<\/a>\u00a0applied in his earliest work. The prominent use of popular music, the shot-on-location New York settings, and the display of low-level gangsters' everyday lives are reminiscent of both\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-v54420\">Who's That Knocking at My Door?<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/mean-streets-v31981\">Mean Streets<\/a>, both films in which\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/keitel-p37381\">Keitel<\/a>\u00a0stars. While certainly paying tribute to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/scorsese-p110533\">Scorsese<\/a>,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/toback-p114247\">Toback<\/a>\u00a0has a purpose to his style beyond simple homage. By putting viewers in this violent, realistic, un-Hollywood location, Jimmy's madness becomes palpable. The world of the film affects the character and the audience in equal measure, making the audience identify all the more with the disturbing aspects of Jimmy's inner life. It is worth noting that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/artist\/toback-p114247\">Toback<\/a>\u00a0gave the disturbed lead character in his directorial debut the same first name as himself.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jr9HymWe19g\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jr9HymWe19g<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>This, like all Deuce screenings will sell out, get your tix here:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitehawkcinema.com\/movie\/fingers\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nitehawkcinema.com\/movie\/fingers\/<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"we will meet in the lobby call\/text my cell 917-388-5838","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MondoCulto\/events\/226688000\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Fingers 35mm film print with director James Toback movie st 9:30pm --SOLD OUT","id":"226688000","time":1447983000000,"updated":1447995287000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302005077000,"name":"Mondo Culto -

As a result, the construction industry is starting to see many new and innovative building enclosures being incorporated into all building types ranging from single family homes all the way up to taller wood-frame and non-combustible high-rise buildings. These more thermally efficient, air-tight, and durable building enclosure designs have evolved from existing North American practices with new materials that have been introduced into the market in recent years. Materials that include many new alternate: air barrier membranes, tapes &amp; sealants, thermally efficient cladding supports, unique fasteners, and insulation products.<\/p> <p><br\/>This half day seminar will provide an in depth overview of many of the new and innovative building enclosure designs that are being designed and constructed in North America with a focus on more thermally efficient, durable and air-tight walls and roofs. New and cutting edge research will be presented on the evaluation of exterior insulation cladding supports to minimize thermal bridging along with the tested real-world performance of various new air barrier systems. This seminar will provide insight as to where these new building enclosure components and assemblies work best along with the limitations of certain products, so you will understand how to best incorporate them on your next project.<\/p> <p>Numerous case studies will be presented to demonstrate how new and innovative building enclosures have been integrated into various projects ranging from mid-rise wood-frame buildings, pre-fabricated passive houses, to towering wood, concrete and steel structures.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>-\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/high-performance-building-enclosures-presented-by-graham-finch-of-rdh-tickets-19264874759\">REGISTER BY CLICKING HERE<\/a>\u00a0-<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>SPEAKER<\/b><\/p> <p>Graham Finch, MASc, P.Eng,\u00a0<i>Principal, Building Science Research Specialist,\u00a0<\/i><i>RDH Building Science, Vancouver, BC, Canada<\/i><\/p> <p>Graham is a Principal and Building Science Research Specialist with RDH Building Science.

It is a festival created to help artists in game creation to thrive by providing a space for them to showcase new work and give them to the ability to reach an audience who craves to see their work. There are other festivals, but they are corporate, in big cities, and far away where it is expensive to stay, eat and get around. This festival is grass roots so as to foster those independent, risk-takers who will be the new voices in game creation. It will allow fans to experience new games, interact and learn from their creators, to meet others who share their passion for gaming; and to celebrate the creativity and artistry that goes into development by awarding the most awesome game creators of 2015. Of course, no gaming festival would be complete without tournaments, hangout rooms, board games and awesome cosplay parties.<\/p> <p><b>Please purchase your event passes using the link below.<br\/><\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/gameacon.com\/buy-event-passes.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gameacon.com\/buy-event-passes.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/gameacon.com\/buy-event-passes.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>Discounted Rooms for the event at Tropicana<\/b><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/resnet.tropicana.net\/cgi-bin\/lansaweb?procfun+rn+resnet+r15+funcparms+UP(A2560):;HGAMEAC;?\">Click here to book a\u00a0discounted room.\u00a0<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ArtandTech\/events\/225179902\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":189000000,"name":"Gameacon -  Game Arts Conference ","id":"225179902","time":1448033400000,"updated":1448224286000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422567260000,"name":"LaunchNJ: Art & Tech Collective","group_lon":-74.1900024414,"id":18393562,"urlname":"ArtandTech","group_lat":40.8100013733,"who":"Art & Techies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10030","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":" NYPL 104 West 136th Street ","name":"COUNTEE CULLEN LIBRARY ","lon":-73.940834,"id":15923182,"state":"NY","lat":40.814972,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":5.18434858322,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447896221000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Elizabeth spotted this event and is going to try and attend with her little girl!<\/p> <p>Babies from birth to 18 months old and their parents\/caregivers can enjoy great books, lively songs, and rhymes, and meet other babies in the neighborhood.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Harlem-Washington-Heights-Uptown-Mom-Baby-Playdates\/events\/226872834\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":1800000,"name":"Baby Story Time","id":"226872834","time":1448033400000,"updated":1448036617000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1444135179000,"name":"Harlem\/Washington Heights\/Uptown Mom & Baby Playdates","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":19001221,"urlname":"Harlem-Washington-Heights-Uptown-Mom-Baby-Playdates","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Uptown Moms & Babies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"75 Maiden Lane, Suite 702","name":"DSA Office","lon":-74.007431,"id":23266082,"state":"NY","lat":40.70776,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.06420016289,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447951084000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We can't let hate and fear sweep our city or nation.

The museum is free on Friday nights so keeping with our cheap is good, free is better mantra, we\u2019ll meet there Friday evening November 20th at 5:30. We\u2019ll spend an hour at the very hip K2 Lounge in the museum\u2019s lobby in order to allow for travel time, then we\u2019ll head upstairs to the exhibit.<br\/>Here\u2019s the link:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/rubinmuseum.org\/events\/exhibitions\/steve-mccurry-india\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/rubinmuseum.org\/events\/exhibitions\/steve-mccurry-india<\/a><br\/>Here\u2019s the story:<br\/>Steve McCurry: India, co-organized by the Rubin Museum and the International Center of Photography, brings together stunning photographs of India\u2014its people, monuments, landscapes, seasons, and cities\u2014by the renowned photographer Steve McCurry. The exhibition, which is representative of three decades of McCurry\u2019s work, is the first museum presentation to focus on his India photographs and includes some that have never been shown before.<br\/>A combination of portraits, landscapes, and documentary imagery express McCurry\u2019s curiosity and commitment to capturing unexpected moments. The exhibition opens with images of spiritual life, as well as selections from the series India by Rail, which portray the movement and life surrounding the Indian Railway. Photographs from the Monsoon series depict India\u2019s season of heavy storms that is also synonymous with life, passion, and celebration. Later works capture beautiful landscapes, historical sites, and the life of ordinary people in major cities and rural areas, representative of diverse regions of India. Objects from the Rubin Museum collection of Himalayan art will be thoughtfully selected to complement the photographs on view and to illustrate the connections between ancient and contemporary India.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SONO-Photography-Club\/events\/226114344\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Steve McCurry: India Photography at the Rubin Museum","id":"226114344","time":1448058600000,"updated":1448129871000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335024295000,"name":"SONO Photography Club","group_lon":-73.6900024414,"id":3713782,"urlname":"SONO-Photography-Club","group_lat":40.9799995422,"who":"Models and Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"W 36th Street between 5th & 6th ave","name":"Suite 36 ","lon":-73.986847,"id":18192812,"state":"NY","lat":40.75108,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.181262344122,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447789316000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Friends,<\/p> <p>Join us for a fun evening this coming Friday, November 20.

You can check out the website here: www.billionoysterproject.org<\/p> <p>We'll also be having our club elections this evening, and nominations can be made just before the election takes place. Eligible members, this is your chance to become more involved in the inner workings of our group!<\/p> <p>Then, in the \"open mike\" portion of the evening, we'll hear from our musicians. We want to make sure we have plenty of music, so please bring your instruments, your voices, and whatever you would like to share with us. A song? A poem? Or anything else that expresses your creativity - but please be ready to join in and sing!<\/p> <p>The evening also features a potluck dinner. It's always interesting to see what kind of food selections people bring! Whether you love to prepare your favorite recipes, or you'd rather just bring something from a salad bar, this is your opportunity to share something delicious with us. A main course, veggies, juice or seltzer to drink are especially welcome! We would also like to encourage people to bring their own utensils and reusable dishes, but whatever you need will be there as well.<\/p> <p>Our monthly gatherings take place at Judson Memorial Church, an organization which shares our vision of social and environmental justice, and activism through the arts. The location is 239 Thompson Street, just south of Washington Square. It's in the basement, so please ring the bell and we'll buzz you in. All are welcome.

And we the people have the legal authority to enforce these rights on behalf of ecosystems. The ecosystem itself can be named as the defendant. Is this a radical concept? Yes and No. Countries like New Zealand, Bolivia and Ecuador have already actualized this concept in different forms, but the common thread is a link to indigenous culture.\u00a0This is an idea whose time has come.\u00a0 Join us to learn, explore and discuss this concept.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER: Liz Marshall is an attorney in Blairstown, NJ.

This revolution supplants traditional knowledge and what you might call an intuitive or \u201ceastern\u201d understanding with modern, \u201cwestern\u201d science and technology-oriented research and investigation. This revolution, unlike any revolution that has come before it, is a celebration. It is a festival.<\/p> <p>And you are invited.<\/p> <p>This is a festival and conference for people who are done with festivals and conferences. This is for the people that are scientifically minded but know enough to know that contemporary science doesn\u2019t have all the answers. This is for the people that want to explore traditional topics in medicine in a fresh, contemporary, young and modern way. This is where east meets west in an opportunity to learn from and engage with open-minded, eye-opening, idea-evolving, self-improving, community-building and thought-leading doctors, researchers, practitioners, patients, artists, performers, cultural innovators, movers and shakers.<\/p> <p>Our mission is to introduce humanity to modern and traditional medicinal, musical and movement-based arts. We believe laughter is the best medicine, we reject all dogma, the only thing we know is that we know nothing at all, and we think that Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Consciousness Hacking, Western Biomedicine, Quantum Physics, Psychedelic Research, Freudian and Jungian Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, Art and Sound Therapy, Nutrition, Plant Medicine, Yoga and Meditation are all topics worthy of our consideration.<\/p> <p>The East Meets West Medicine Fest is not only where the eastern mindframe meets the western, it is where the east coast meets the west coast. We are inspired by the explosion of the west coast music festival culture, the art, the music, the workshops and talks, and we are bringing it to the east coast in a novel form that focuses on the lectures and workshops as much as the music. We are breathing new life into the archetype of the festival so come here to engage, to listen, to be inspired and also to dance. Come here to meet your new physician, one who genuinely cares about your physical and mental well-being.<\/p> <p>There will be Dr.\u2019s and DJ\u2019s, meditation and medication, technology and herbology, and a whole lot more. During the evening portion of the event on Saturday November 21st, taking place at and sponsored by The Open Center, there will be vendors, workshops, DJs, Visual Projections, Dancing, Art Spaces, Tea Service, Performances and more. And expect a weekend full of comedic intermissions.<\/p> <p>Learn to take charge of your health in a way that\u2019s accessible, affordable and enjoyable. This is your chance to be part of something big. If you are interested in participating as a volunteer, coming on as a sponsor, presenting as a speaker, showing off your art or offering your medical services by donation, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us through the contact form on our website, or at [masked]<\/p> <p>We will have a very small number of press passes and scholarship\/discount tickets available, so please reach out to us if you are under severe financial duress.

Each headset has a color LED that shows what you are listening to, so you can dance along with those listening to the same music as you. If you need to leave at any point, just hand your headphones into any staff member.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/GET-YOUR-DANCE-ON-NYC\/events\/226663964\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":14400000,"name":"Underground Party \u2013 Subway Tour!","id":"226663964","time":1448064000000,"updated":1448079352000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1260806580000,"name":"GET YOUR DANCE ON NYC!","group_lon":-74,"id":1569267,"urlname":"GET-YOUR-DANCE-ON-NYC","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"153 East 53rd Street","name":"Atrium at Citigroup Center ","lon":-73.970444,"id":4611332,"state":"NY","lat":40.758438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.18020117283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434143344000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u30fc NEW MEMBERS ARE WELCOME \u30fc<\/p> <p><b>What is J-Kuru?<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>These evening events are for those who want to learn Japanese \u00a0&amp; \"\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u305f\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\" \u3002\u00a0Beginner intermediate, and advanced levels are all welcome!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/b\/8\/600_398215992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Practice &amp; improve your Japanese\/English in a fun, casual environment--and make a few friends along the way!

This revolution, unlike any revolution that has come before it, is a celebration. It is a festival.\u00a0<\/p> <p>And you are invited.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This is a festival and conference for people who are done with festivals and conferences. This is for the people that are scientifically minded but know enough to know that contemporary science doesn\u2019t have all the answers. This is for the people that want to explore traditional topics in medicine in a fresh, contemporary, young and modern way. This is where east meets west in an opportunity to learn from and engage with open-minded, eye-opening, idea-evolving, self-improving, community-building and thought-leading doctors, researchers, practitioners, patients, artists, performers, cultural innovators, movers and shakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our mission is to introduce humanity to modern and traditional medicinal, musical and movement-based arts. We believe laughter is the best medicine, we reject all dogma, the only thing we know is that we know nothing at all, and we think that Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Consciousness Hacking, Western Biomedicine, Quantum Physics, Psychedelic Research, Freudian and Jungian Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, Art and Sound Therapy, Nutrition, Plant Medicine, Yoga and Meditation are all topics worthy of our consideration.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The East Meets West Medicine Fest is not only where the eastern mindframe meets the western, it is where the east coast meets the west coast. We are inspired by the explosion of the west coast music festival culture, the art, the music, the workshops and talks, and we are bringing it to the east coast in a novel form that focuses on the lectures and workshops as much as the music. We are breathing new life into the archetype of the festival so come here to engage, to listen, to be inspired and also to dance. Come here to meet your new physician, one who genuinely cares about your physical and mental well-being.<\/p> <p>There will be Dr.\u2019s and DJ\u2019s, meditation and medication, technology and herbology, and a whole lot more. During the evening portion of the event on Saturday November 21st, taking place at and sponsored by The Open Center, there will be vendors, workshops, DJs, Visual Projections, Dancing, Art Spaces, Tea Service, Performances and more. And expect a weekend full of comedic intermissions.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Learn to take charge of your health in a way that\u2019s accessible, affordable and enjoyable. This is your chance to be part of something big. If you are interested in participating as a volunteer, coming on as a sponsor, presenting as a speaker, showing off your art or offering your medical services by donation, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us through the contact form on our website, or at [masked]\u00a0<\/p> <p>We will have a very small number of press passes and scholarship\/discount tickets available, so please reach out to us if you are under severe financial duress. We have made these tickets as affordable as possible, and we don\u2019t want anyone to be turned away for lack of funds, but seating is limited at this event, so we will do what we can to accommodate.

(This doesn't give a lot of time to read but it's a fast one and obviously reading the book is not required!) I'm inviting another book club I'm a part of, as well as some friends and superfans, and am hoping this will be more entertaining and inclusive than a traditional book launch party and have the same laid back and fun vibe as book club. Feel free to invite anyone. Location is TBD depending on how many people it seems like will show up, so if you can let me know if you think you might come that would be great! I won't post the location on here because the Internet is creepy but will figure out the best way to let people know.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal. We constantly monitor registrations and amp up promotion to try and ensure and equal gender ration. Sometimes there's 1 or 2 more men or women. Sometimes it's even numbers. This is heavily dependent on the age range and weather. <i>We will NOT host an event if there isn't AT LEAST 7 of each gender registered, and we will NOT let there be an excessive (more than 3) amount of one gender versus the other.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>*This is not a guaranteed number of dates.<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b><i>See other RSVPS posted on our other groups.

Two of his admirers are Richard Gere and Lou Reed, who provide the narration for his dangerous journey out of China and the subsequent spread of his influence around the world. Brilliant Moon was filmed in Tibet, India, Bhutan, the United States and Nepal, and uses animation, rare archival footage and interviews with some of Tibet's great thinkers, to tell his moving life story, from birth to death to rebirth.

We're taking the opportunity to work with Neesy before the New Year and we have a few sexy looks in store.<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Max. 4 photographers) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (Me and Joe will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About this Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three looks planned. (with a possible 4th pending time) We are planning a \"shower\" look, with a more dramatic lighting scheme. We have a boudoir, lingerie\/implied look. (Bed setup) We are also bringing Christmas a little early with a Christmas modern pinup look.

From here on in, we have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. This will ensure that we have the\u00a0minimum\u00a0amount of RSVP to actually hold the Meetup. So, please only sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit. Your spot is not held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page.<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$70<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(Balance due at time of shoot: $50, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.)<\/p> <p>(Non-Commercial Release provided onsite or PDF version to email registered upon check-in.)<\/p> <p><b>Models:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Neesy Rizzo:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/officialneesyrizzo\/\">Instagram<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/anaisneesyrizzo\">Facebook<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/2\/7\/600_444306951.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/3\/3\/600_444306963.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/3\/b\/600_444306971.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/b\/5\/1\/600_444306993.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Policy and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p>One-on-One:\u00a0The model will be available for one half hour one on one shoot after the first two hours in the Meetup. If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p>Shared One-on-Ones:\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. So, at the very least give us\u00a03 days notice\u00a0that you will not be able to attend or in case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up past the 3 days notice, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the models beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup.<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a wait list, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels within the 3 days before the shoot, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\". Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/226860437\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Glamour & Implied Shoot w\/Neesy Rizzo - Nov. 20th","id":"226860437","time":1448064000000,"updated":1448110246000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"Disclosed on tickets","name":"nyc","lon":-74.005943,"id":24213378,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447725455000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let Stephanie Shapiro help you prepare for your next social function (wedding, birthday parties, corporate events).

And for more than 50 years, these Q Branch creations have developed into a sort of shadow technological history that has both been inspired\u2014and been inspired by\u2014real-life tech. Here, journalist Seth Porges takes a look at the surprising stories behind many of Bond\u2019s most famous\u2014and infamous\u2014toys.<\/p> <p>Bio: Seth Porges is a technology journalist, entrepreneur, TV commentator, and co-founder of Cloth for iOS. A former editor (and current contributor) at Maxim and Popular Mechanics, he also contributes to InStyle, Fast Company, Self, Men\u2019s Journal, Mashable, and Forbes. In addition to making regular appearances on cable news as a science and technology analyst, he appears on four series currently in rotation on History, Discovery, and National Geographic. His recently produced documentary series \u201cThe Most Insane Amusement Park Ever\u201d was based on a prior Nerd Nite talk.

The trips below are priced as one of the most affordable trips on the market. \u00a0They are also the most fun in my\u00a0opinion! \u00a0Cuba is a bit more expensive as you need to have a charter flight from Miami to Havana.

As many of you know those sanctions are being slowly lifted and the door has opened allowing Americans to finally discover this amazing country and its people. Cuba offers a diverse and colorful history as well as a unique view into a country that has had little to work with over the last 50 years and yet with so little the people remain optimistic towards the future.\u00a0 Come see Cuba before McDonalds and Starbucks move in!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/9\/b\/600_436121115.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The trips offered by Globe Drifters are some of the most affordable legal Cuban trips on the market for Americans.\u00a0We work with an overseas company that has specialized in Cuba travel for over 10 years, therefore you know you are getting a quality product. <b>The max amount of travelers in a group is 12 people<\/b>.\u00a0Most other tour groups have an average of 15-30 people in their groups and with this many people it does NOT allow for easy travel and is more \u201ctour groupish.\u201d Large groups are less able to integrate into a society and generally have less authentic contact with the locals. The more people in the tour group, the more the group experiences their own culture rather than the one of the country they are visiting. \u00a0We are committed to keeping our groups at 12 travelers or less in order to keep the trips authentic. Also, in order to stay at the local \u2018casas\u2019 (guesthouses) where there are limited rooms we need the group to remain intimate and small. Due to the high number of people that want to travel to Cuba \u00a0your group will be relatively full with 10-12 people in each trip.<\/p> <p>If you would like to stay abreast of trip details join the Cuba Facebook Event!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/850481545009517\/\">Cuba Facebook Event<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/0\/a\/0\/600_436121120.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The trips offered above fall under the United States Department of Treasury\u2019s guidelines for legal travel to Cuba for American citizens.

Paladar means\u00a0\u201cpalate\u201d\u00a0and is named after a chain of restaurants in a Brazilian soap opera popular in Cuba.

Havana\u2019s Old City is one of the best preserved colonial cities in all of the Americas, and was designated a World Heritage Site in 1982. The streets are lined with colonial architecture, 16th century fortresses and countless churches. The guided walking tour of Old Havana will take you visit La Catedral San Cristobal de la Habana, the Palacio de los Marqueses de Aguas Claras and the Plaza de Armas. We will also visit the Museo de la Revolucion, to learn about the history of the Cuban Revolution and see the infamous Hall of Cretins. After lunch we visit the fishing village of Jaimanitas and the home of the famous artist Jose Fuster. Fuster has made his entire home, and much of the surrounding neighborhood, into an artwork using tiles in mosaic forms. Now referred to as Fusterlandia, it is a unique work of public art with over 80 houses decorated with ornate murals and domes to suit the personality of each of Fuster\u2019s neighbours. You will be able to meet with the family to discuss their art projects and view the gallery in Jose Fuster\u2019s home.

Get an insight as to how the communist system works, how much tobacco they will keep, how much produce they give back to the government and how they make ends meet! You will learn about the process of tobacco planting to rolling the final cigar. We will share in the secret recipe from one family passed down through 3 generations of how they cure their leaves for cigars, drink some freshly roasted coffee from the farm while we watch an expert roll us some cigars. Vi\u00f1ales is one of the more agriculturally productive areas, so an abundance of local seasonal fruit and vegetables is always on offer such as enormous avocados and mangoes, pineapples, papaya, guava, and a several varieties of sweet potatoes. In the afternoon we learn to cook Cuban-style with a cooking lesson from a local chef. We will accompany the chef to the local markets to buy the ingredients for our platos tipicos Cubanos like congri, potaje, garbanzo soup, ajiaco, and flan. After the cooking lesson we can sit back and relax to enjoy the well prepared meal.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/4\/e\/2\/600_436122210.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Included:<\/p> <p>Activities:\u00a0Visit a local Tabacco farm.

Like Havana, Cienfuegos has a beautiful Malec\u00f3n, where you can pass a peaceful evening watching fisherman cast nets and locals socialize. On the way to Cienfuegos we visit the Korimakao Cultural Project in Ci\u00e9nega de Zapata, an area famous for its wetlands. Korimakao is a project founded in 1992 to bring theatre, music, and dancing to remote areas of Cuba. Here we will meet with the teachers, directors who will talk to us about the importance of this project and the number of students that benefit from such a project in this area.<\/p> <p>After lunch, we drive along the picturesque Bay of Pigs past the site where the landing of U.S. sponsored counter-revolutionary exile militia occurred in 1961. Today there is a museum here that recounts the events of this conflict which resulted in the first defeat of a U.S backed take-over in Latin America. There are some beautiful places to stop for a swim along the way including a sink hole which resembles a huge natural tropical fish tank, so make sure to pack your swim wear and snorkeling gear if you have any (or you can rent it!).<\/p> <p>On arrival to Cienfuegos we settle into our homestays before taking a walk around the city to learn its history. In the evening we join together for another delicious home cooked meal with a local family.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/a\/8\/4\/600_436123652.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Included:<\/p> <p>Activities:\u00a0AM: Visit Korimakao.

We are near the lovely Valle de los Ingenios (Valley of Sugarmills) and Playa Anc\u00f3n. We begin with a cultural tour of Trinidad where we will visit various museums including the Afro Cuban temple to Yemaya and learn about the Afro-Cuban religion. We will be invited to sit and learn about the religion and it\u2019s deities from the official caretaker -a priest called Israel. After lunch we will learn about the dancing scene in Cuba. We\u2019ll start by meeting the Afro Cuban Folkloric dance group that perform Afro Cuban shows at the club Palenque. We\u2019ll learn about the cultural and social importance that dancing has to Cuba. We\u2019ll be welcomed into the venue where they train and perform before taking on a Cuban salsa class. Nightlife in Trinidad is probably the most accessible and intense in all of Cuba, with numerous live music venues and many dance performances every day of the week, all amongst the enchanting setting of old colonial buildings and the cobblestone streets.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/3\/3\/600_436123827.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Included:<\/p> <p>Activities:\u00a0AM: Orientation walk of the city &amp; Cultural tour of Trinidad.

On the way we stop in a very simple campesino\u2019s home to learn about life in the rural areas of Cuba. After cooling off in the natural pools, we return to Trinidad where you\u2019ll have the rest of the afternoon to relax and explore. For dinner tonight we have a special bonfire BBQ at Playa Ancon with a local musician and a delicious array of local Cuban specialties prepared by our favorite local chefs.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/9\/9\/600_436123929.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Included:<\/p> <p>Activities:\u00a0AM: Walk to waterfall.

A 44m tower was built to look over the slaves as they worked. It has a sugar cane press that the slaves used to operate, and the village around the mansion is inhabited by direct descendants of the slaves. Here we will learn more about the slave trade. Continuing onwards, we stop in at the town of Santa Clara,\u00a0a key city in the Cuban Revolution. Upon entering Santa Clara, we will see the iconic statue of\u00a0Ernesto Ch\u00e9 Guevara, built\u00a0to commemorate his death and that of the revolutionaries who died along with him in Bolivia. We will have our lunch at a small family farm near Santa Clara and head back to Havana where we will have some free time to freshen up before our farewell dinner, and of course, one final fun-filled night of music and dancing!<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/b\/7\/600_436123959.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Included:<\/p> <p>Activities:\u00a0AM: Manaca Iznaga Sugar mill visit.

It tracks his artistic evolution from the 1930s and early 1940s, when he made loosely figurative images based on mythical or primeval themes, to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when he pioneered the radical abstractions for which he is best known by pouring and dripping paint onto canvas or paper. The exhibition features approximately 50 works\u2014paintings, drawings, and prints\u2014from the Museum\u2019s collection, which is unparalleled in the breadth, depth, and quality of its Pollock holdings. Among the paintings on view is\u00a0One: Number 31, 1950\u00a0(1950), arguably Pollock\u2019s greatest masterpiece, and one of his largest canvases. Exceedingly rare and little-known engravings, lithographs, screenprints, and drawings are also included, highlighting an underappreciated side of one of the most important and influential American artists of the 20th century. By bringing together works made using a range of materials and techniques\u2014both traditional and unorthodox\u2014the exhibition underscores the relentless experimentation and emphasis on process that was at the heart of Pollock\u2019s creativity.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nIf there is interest, we will have a conversation over coffee afterwards.\u00a0 There are two Starbucks withing walking distance.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/artsake\/events\/226870204\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"POLLOCK AT MoMA - You MUST be a MoMA member to RSVP for this event.","id":"226870204","time":1448116200000,"updated":1448147273000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1332267201000,"name":"ART FOR ART'S SAKE","group_lon":-74,"id":3514092,"urlname":"artsake","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07450","country":"us","city":"Ridgewood","address_1":"90 E Ridgewood Ave","name":"Ridgewood Coffee Company","lon":-74.118335,"id":1165414,"state":"NJ","lat":40.979372,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":17.243560791,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447698278000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This will be a 5 mile route that goes through the streets of Ridgewood. \u00a0We will meet outside Ridgewood Coffee Company, just across from the big clock in Ridgewood at the intersection of E.

Typically, we see it as a combination of knowledge, insight and judgment that work together. But a more expanded view is needed.<\/p> <p>If we imagine a wisdom spectrum, we might start on one end with \"common sense,\" that kind of everyday know-how formed from experience and some native ability. On the other end of the spectrum there would be the expanding breadth and depth of understanding and acquired knowledge that is creative and intuitive. This expanded ability makes it possible to see and tolerate the big picture with all of life's ambiguities and constantly changing nature with a sense of balance and equanimity.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In the Buddhist context there are some specific and particular focal points that are foundational to the development of wisdom. The first important element, particularly from Tibetan traditions, is that wisdom travels with and is deeply intermingled with compassion. The image they use is the two wings of a bird of awakening. Diana Gould writes that \"wisdom without compassion can be dry and indifferent; compassion without wisdom an be mushy, saccharine and maudlin.\" Compassion is our natural inclination and readiness to share with people who are suffering because, just like them, we have known suffering. Buddhist tradition is always aimed at living a life that is beneficial to other beings and to ourselves. Working together, Wisdom and Compassion are a powerful force.The Ten Perfections are important mind\/body qualities or strengths that we can cultivate in any life situation and on the cushion. \u00a0When we make these Perfections our priority in life, they support us on our journey toward awake awareness. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p>The Ten Perfections or qualities of mind are:<\/p> <p>Generosity (Giving)<br\/>Virtue (Morality\/Ethics)<br\/>Renunciation (Letting go of obstacles to awakening)<br\/>Wisdom (Discernment)<br\/>Energy (Effort)<br\/>Patience (Endurance)<br\/>Truthfulness<br\/>Determination\/Resolution<br\/>Loving Kindness\/Goodwill<br\/>Equanimity (Impartiality and balance)<\/p> <p>The brief topic discussion will be followed by a guided meditation and time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.

We are a group of tennis enthusiast of 2.5 to 4.0 levels that have the fundamental parts of the game down and like to hit against different styles of play.<\/p> <p><b>WHY PLAY HERE?<\/b><\/p> <p>Well, first of all it is a nice serene location (i.e. no basketball courts, grandstands, or any other type of distraction). Secondly, consider the cost options to play else elsewhere in-and-around the city...<\/p> <p>1) unless you have endless tennis competitors on your roll-a-dex, you'll need a web-based database\/system to find people. Most of these tennis databases\/systems charge in different ways. Fact, Meetup charges me a premium every month because of the member pool size and this has to be\u00a0 prepaid just to keep the group alive.<\/p> <p>2) if you play elsewhere, you will need a permit which will currently cost you $15 for a single day (or $200 for a yearly). To be more specific, these two options really only entitle you to one hour of singles play (vs. 2 hours here), meaning your partner will also need a permit.<\/p> <p>3) new balls are provided at the beginning of each day. Typical extra-duty balls run about $3 per can off-the-shelf, so if you are an avid player...you'll save time and money running around picking-up tennis balls.<\/p> <p>4) if someone were to break a string, or you just want to try a different racquet for an evaluation (i.e. lighter weight, bigger head, tighter strings, etc), racquets are available at no addition cost.<\/p> <p>5) seasonally \"clean\" courts. Throughout the year tennis courts pile up with blowing leaves, pollen, acorns, etc. I get here early every session to ensure the courts are clean. I do this with a battery-powered blower and if any body knows anything about batteries...its that they don't last! Each time I have to replace one (which only does one court), it cost me nearly $100 for each.<\/p> <p>6) portions of fee here actually go repairing the courts and\/or nets. Case-and-point the cement required to fill cracks which was recently done by myself.<\/p> <p>7) there are port-a-potty's and 2 drinking fountains available for all to use<\/p> <p>8) no dress code required like some places...but proper edict is appreciated<\/p> <p>9) based on the talent that signup, I may ask people to move around to establish a competitive session for all those involved<\/p> <p>Hopefully this addresses all those questions like: is it free or why does it cost.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>WAYS TO RSVP... <\/b><\/p> <p>Within Meetup, just click RSVP for the time slot that works best with your schedule and be resposible to attend.

But it's under construction this weekend. So here's the revised itinerary, including an earlier meeting time (11:45 AM):<\/p> <p>We'll take the free ferry (plus a 20-minute MTA train ride) to the fascinating heart of Staten Island. (Don't be late: Ferry leaves promptly at 12 noon.) \u00a0<\/p> <p>First we'll walk about 30 minutes from the train station to\u00a0a heavily wooded LaTourette Park, part of the S.I. Greenbelt. Then\u00a0we'll walk through the forest for about an hour and a half; we'll have lunch outdoors in the woods. Next we'll walk through a lovely neighborhood to the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art, with buildings and gardens designed to resemble a Himalayan mountain monastery. Jacques was actually a pioneering woman who designed the museum and amassed its collection during the\u00a01930s and '40s. To me, this \"museum\" is more authentic and inspiring than Manhattan's glitzier but more sterile Rubin Museum of Tibetan Art. Then we'll visit the only home in NYC built by Frank Lloyd Wright. Finally we'll\u00a0return to the ferry terminal by a bus near the Tibetan museum.\u00a0<\/p> <p>NOTE: Don't worry about the seemingly huge group.

WE MUST WALK MODERATELY OR WE'LL END UP WALKING IN THE DARK.\u00a0<\/p> <p>ENDING TIME: We'll probably get back to the ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan at around 6:30 PM. But you can leave earlier, by catching a bus after the Tibet Museum if you wish; it leaves somewhere between 3 and 3:30 PM.<\/p> <p>COST: $4 (special group rate) for the Tibetan museum, $5.50 round trip for the train and bus (unless your metrocard is unlimited), and $2 for me, in part to cover Meetup's organizer fee.<\/p> <p><br\/>TRANSPORTATION TO FERRY TERMINAL: The number 1 train is not running to the ferry terminal.

(1 John 4:14)\u00a0The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes whether Jew or Greek (Rom\u00a01:16-17) to all them that call upon him (Rom\u00a010:12-15). For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to\u00a0faith.\u00a0 The Gospel declares that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, he was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures, that he was seen of\u00a0Cephas, the twelve and then of five hundred brethren at once. (1 Cor 15:1-3)\u00a0Through the Gospel we understand that\u00a0that the stone which was rejected is become the head of the corner.\u00a0 Jesus\u00a0Christ who was rejected and crucified rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and is now exalted\u00a0far above all principalities and powers (Ps\u00a0118:22-23, Mat 21:42, Acts 4:10-12, 1\u00a0Cor\u00a015:1-3,\u00a0Eph\u00a01:20-21).\u00a0We must know with all assurance that God hath made Jesus both Lord and Christ. (Acts 2:36, 4:26)\u00a0This tried stone is none other than Jesus Christ; whose name is called Wonderful,\u00a0Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u00a0(Is\u00a07:10-14,\u00a0Mat 1:21-23;\u00a0Is\u00a08:10-18,\u00a09:6-7;\u00a01 Pet 2:4-8). This is the true God and eternal life. (1\u00a0Jn\u00a05:20)<\/p> <p>\n\n\u00a0 Jesus Christ came preaching repentance and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat 4:17). In order to enter into the kingdom of God we must be born again of the water and of the Spirit as Jesus told\u00a0Nicodemus\u00a0(Jn\u00a03:3-5). Those early disciples in the book of Acts were born again when they repented, were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and received the infilling of the Holy Ghost. (Acts 2:37-41, 8:12-17, 9:17-18, 10:44-48, 19:1-6) The baptisms in the book of Acts were done in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 4:12, 8:12, 10:48, 19:5, Gal 3:27,\u00a0Rom\u00a06:3-4,\u00a0Col\u00a02:12). In order to obey the Gospel and enter into the kingdom of God we too must do what those early disciples did and what Jesus commanded.
