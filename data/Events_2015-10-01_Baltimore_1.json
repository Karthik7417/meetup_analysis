Gilbert, long before he worked with Arthur Sullivan, was Victorian England's leading dramatist. In this hilarious topsy-turvy send-up of Victorian \"Sensation Novels\" (a genre still with us today as Romance Fiction), Gilbert gives us 5 \"stock characters\" who refuse to conform to society's expectations or the novel's author's plans for them -- they turn the story upside down, break all the conventions of the stage, and indulge in some VERY modern activities. This musical play, with a new score by British composer Michael Nash that incorporates some of the original (mostly lost) music, is both outrageous, touching and funny -- a window into an 1871 that was FAR from stodgy and predictable!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Midtown-Theatre-Meetup\/events\/223091824\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"A SENSATION NOVEL","id":"223091824","time":1442534400000,"updated":1442631759000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1348575885000,"name":"Midtown Theatre Meetup","group_lon":-76.5899963379,"id":5097352,"urlname":"Midtown-Theatre-Meetup","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Theatre Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Odenton","address_1":"8266 Lokus Rd","name":"Odenton Sports Center","lon":-76.697739,"id":23541089,"state":"MD","lat":39.098236,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":13.9164428711,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441035666000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"www.odentonsc.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Odenton-Futsal-Meetup\/events\/225016438\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Bring Flats & $5 for court fees","id":"qzbkklytmbwb","time":1442534400000,"updated":1442546949000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1419699062000,"name":"Odenton Futsal Meetup","group_lon":-76.6999969482,"id":18276500,"urlname":"Odenton-Futsal-Meetup","group_lat":39.0699996948,"who":"Futsalers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21209","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"6080 Falls Road","address_2":"in the back","lon":-76.650403,"phone":"410-377-4800","name":"BYV, Mt.

The most noticeable changes were that it really pushed me passed my plateau in my growth by helping me clear out some energetic blocks and feelings that I thought I had taken care of. If your true goal is to elevate your vibration, this will do it. The 2nd time and probably the most amazing was getting the spheres to relieve pain. I was having joint pain and migraines. I was about to go on a 2 week vacation with lots of walking, so Jenn gave me the spheres and I didn\u2019t have any hip\/joint pain or migraines the entire time!! It was so good that I told her next time I travel, I\u2019m booking a session with her and asked that she also add spheres to my feet!\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cJenn is too awesome to put into words. Humble, sweet, and loving\u2026she uses these in Holistic Metamorphosis to be a catalyst for the change you seek. If you have tried Reiki, MDH, or other healing work and still need to dig deeper- definitely make an appointment or take the classes being offered. You won\u2019t be sorry. At worst, you will end up freeing some things which have been bothering you. At best, you will see a total transformation\u2026something that has come through for me as a result of the work Jenn has facilitated with me.\u201d<\/i><\/p> <p><i>\u201cI really did feel the energy from the spheres that Jenn does\u2026I was lying down receiving my session (Jenn is a wonderful intuitive and a great healer!) with my eyes closed and I could literally feel the heat above my forehead.\u00a0 I told Jenn what I was feeling and she said it was a sphere of energy\u2013and it was amazing that I could\u00a0actually\u00a0feel that with my eyes closed!\u00a0 I highly recommend Jenn and her new amazing healing modality!\u201d<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Enter Dunkin Donut driveway","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CAMHealing\/events\/222944947\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":198000000,"name":"Holistic Metamorphosis\u2122 Foundation","id":"222944947","time":1442584800000,"updated":1442791018000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1256063651000,"name":"Maryland Healers and Enthusiasts","group_lon":-76.8499984741,"id":1543672,"urlname":"CAMHealing","group_lat":39.1699981689,"who":"CAM Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21409","country":"us","city":"Arnold","address_1":"618 Broadneck Road","name":"Broadneck Park","lon":-76.454155,"id":15805392,"state":"MD","lat":39.03233,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.9380245209,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441372998000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Nothing says fall is coming like delicious apples!

No matter what else we do, the primary focus of life \u2013 thoughts, words and actions- should be on the growth of the heart in all its different realms.As we grow in the realms of the heart, we become able to see, feel and understand people around us. Therefore, our relationships with others become deeper and more harmonious.

Meet at the culdesac\/circle at the end of the road. 5400 Landing Road, Elkridge, MD, 21075 (Pinned location is shown correctly at the end of the road)<\/p> <p><b>What time:<\/b> Meet between 8:30 and 9:00 AM at parking lot. Wheels rolling by 9:00.<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be approx. 7-9 mph moving average (some of the climbs I'll be as slow as 3 mph, just a warning). Please note people tend to lose about 1 mph average in Patapsco as compared to Rosaryville, or Fairland. These paces are appropriate for most average riders who have good cardio endurance, but not for beginners, due to terrain and mileage. Attitude is laid-back and friendly. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait up for slower riders, this is NOT the ride for you. It is NOT a training ride, and Racer X will be disappointed).<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but some sections may be loose and\/or soft, i.e., plan on some mud spots. There are a few steep\/long climbs, rocks and technical sections, and a stream crossing or two. A couple of sections may be a hike-a-bike for some of us. There are also active road sections. This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. This video of Patapsco represents most of the area we will hit:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/qv1184Tv8-M?list=FL5Gf8RkapzRQZhvhSiQr8Ng\" class=\"embedded\">http:\/\/youtu.be\/qv1184Tv8-M?list=FL5Gf8RkapzRQZhvhSiQr8Ng<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b> Approx. 28 miles, give or take a few. Exact route may change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, etc., but we will be on single track most of the day. Only about 2 miles of this route is paved (grist mill trail, and river road). Please understand this will be demanding. Please also note we will be climbing about 2,600 feet in elevation. This is the anticipated route. We will hit the valley view and chute trails twice, but in different directions (makes it feel new. LOL)...For those of you whose legs give out, there are intersections at around 6, 8, and 12 miles where you can bail, and it is fairly easy to get back to Rockburn. The PDF below shows most of the trails in the park in red, and the route in yellow (close, but will add a little to it to get to 28).

The Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, have\u00a0helped make Sandy Spring a prosperous farming and commercial center. The Friends Meeting House, built in 1817, is the center of religious and community life. Even though slavery will not\u00a0be abolished in Maryland until 1864, Maryland Quakers outlawed the owning of slaves by its\u00a0members in 1777. In Sandy Spring, free blacks own their own homes and have organized churches,\u00a0schools, and an array of social clubs although such public gatherings are extremely dangerous in this\u00a0anti-abolitionist county.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Local patrols and slave catchers stalk the fields and woods. Quakers and free\u00a0blacks assist escaping slaves via the secret \u201cUnderground Railroad\u201d\u2014 a system of people and places\u00a0organized to help slaves escape to freedom. Rumor has it that the fugitive slave, Dred Scott, is\u00a0staying in the log cabin home of Enoch George Howard while the US Supreme Court deliberates whether or not Scott\u00a0should be returned to his owner in Missouri. (A county attorney, Montgomery Blair, unsuccessfully defends him.)\u00a0You are escaping to freedom and have made it to Woodlawn (the start of the trail). Now you must\u00a0travel through woods and skirt the edges of farm fields to safely reach the Sandy Spring itself.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Can you do it?<\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i><br\/><\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Program Overview<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Underground Railroad Experience Trail hikes commemorate the involvement of Montgomery County residents in the Underground Railroad and celebrates the Quaker heritage and traditions of Sandy Spring.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Our guided hike will last 2.5 hours and is provided by talented and trained \"conductors\" who will lead us on a simulated Underground Railroad experience covering 2.0 miles from Woodlawn Manor Cultural Park along a wooded, natural surface trail to the historic Sandy Spring, then back to the park.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Hikers learn about various techniques that \"freedom seekers\" used to elude trackers, find food, and navigate their way North to freedom.

These meditation sessions are secular and available to anyone wishing to meditate. All experience levels are welcome. During this session, I'll be offering 4 rounds of 10 to 15 minutes of Shamatha Meditation (also known as Calm Abiding, or Mindfulness meditation). If you are new to meditation and you would like to discuss the technique one on one, please send me a message, and we can schedule time before meditation to go over the technique.

The festival is sponsored by the local merchants association which works to keep the neighborhood close to its roots. John Waters still gets his mail at the Atomic Bookstore, which tells you what you need to know about the continuing hip vibe of the Hampden area.<\/p> <p>The local streets are taken over with vendors, live music, and food stalls that augment the usual array of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. There are also contests for Hamden's Got Talent, Ms. Hampden, and assorted other categories. The live music entertainment starts at 11:00 am and continues till 7:00 pm on four stages.<\/p> <p>This is a do-your-own thing event where people can wander around to see what's happening and soak it all up. There's no need to stay with our SHR group, but you'll most likely bump into several of us during the afternoon.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

When I returned to the states, I resolved not to ride in cars in an effort to combat what I had seen. I kept that up for two years until I became involved in organizing and decided that if we want to shape our world then we have to engage with it more systematically.\u201d Now an undergraduate at Warren Wilson College in Asheville NC, he is double majoring in chemistry and in environmental education.

The Maryland Renaissance Festival is a recreation of a 16th century English village. Our village is named Revel Grove, and is set on a beautiful 25-acre wooded site with 85 acres of free parking. The village consists of craft and food booths, five pubs, ten major stages, a Jousting Arena and lots of games. Every day is a Festival Day in Revel Grove, in honor of a visit by Henry VIII and his Royal Court. As such, the village will have entertainment, crafts, food, and frivolity fit for a king! Once inside the gates, you may want to check your program for a listing of all the shows, but part of the fun of our Renaissance Festival is taking your time to stroll through the lanes and let the experience unfold before you. Pause for a moment to listen to a musician. Watch a demonstration of glass blowing. Quench your thirst with a mug of ale and whet your appetite with a gigantic turkey leg, or the many food offerings on a stake (everything tastes better on a stake.) Pick up the latest gossip from the fishmonger. Thrill to the combat joust and then browse through the wares at one of the many fine craft booths. Watch authentic jousting in full armor, listen to music and choral groups, thrill at jugglers, magicians, and comely wenches. Our streets and stages are filled with nonstop entertainment.<\/p> <p>We will meet near the Porta Potties near the main gate at 11:00 to beat the crowds. Closer to the date I will post a list of acts that I will be attending so members of the group can find us if\/when they get separated. You are welcome to see those act, or branch off and see other acts and meet up with the group later. Tickets will be discounted at $17.00 a person, if we have a large enough group we will get them for $15.00.<\/p> <p>Hope to see all you Lords and Ladies there,<\/p> <p>Doug<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/rennfest.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/rennfest.com\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BaltimoreNewbies\/events\/224695696\/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"name":"The Maryland Renaissance Festival","id":"224695696","time":1442761200000,"updated":1442790752000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286047757000,"name":"Baltimore Newbies","group_lon":-76.5899963379,"id":1716109,"urlname":"BaltimoreNewbies","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Newbies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":7.87730836868,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438214196000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come and pay tribute to the life giving rivers of our region at this Festival of Rivers.

It unites mind and body through awesome moves. The dance has spread... worldwide and is now spreading like fire in the US. It is a derivative of traditional Angolan Semba. On this basis, Kizomba music emerged as a more modern music genre with a sensual touch mixed with African rhythm. Unlike Semba, Kizomba music is characterised by a slower and usually very romantic rhythm, sung generally in Portuguese. It is described as an \"Open mind dance\", a rhythmical body expression, very smooth, relaxed and sexy at the same time.<\/p> <p>Event Schedule:<br\/>2 - 6 PM Workshops<br\/>6 - 9 PM Dancing Outdoors, sand, palm trees, evening sky and lights<\/p> <p>Choice of three 2 hour workshops followed by outdoor dancing at the CC Beach.<\/p> <p>Workshop A: 2 - 4 PM - Kizomba for Beginners, Learn how (David &amp; Guida)<\/p> <p>Workshop B: 4 - 6 PM - Intermediate Kizomba Stylings (David &amp; Guida)<\/p> <p>Workshop C: 2 - 4 PM - KizAsOne Kizomba, Ladies and Men's Styling, Musicality &amp; Creativity (Kaem &amp; Marine)<\/p> <p>Pricing:<\/p> <p>*\u00a0Each 2 hour Workshop: $25 online\/$30 at door, includes the dance social<\/p> <p>* Dance Social only: $10, includes Kizomba Now plus the admission to Sunday Salsa Latin Night at Cancun Cantina<\/p> <p>To purchase: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventbrite.com%2Fe%2Fdance-kizomba-now-workshops-and-dancing-with-david-campos-guida-rei-from-nycportugal-and-kaem-tickets-18466389468&amp;h=eAQFA4j8R&amp;enc=AZPQJC9JvLhxEFJkUqELhoY59vSo6AEXIg_KVIENxaq49mmlP8pTchajfT03sRBWrvE&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/dance-kizomba-now-workshops-and-dancing-with-david-campos-guida-rei-from-nycportugal-and-kaem-tickets-18466389468\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/dance-kizomba-now-workshops-and-dancing-with-david-campos-guida-rei-from-nycportugal-and-kaem-tickets-18466389468<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SalsaNow.net%2F&amp;h=KAQHgEEIV&amp;enc=AZM_TXInH-ZaCGsHa1SJj7yp7yVxy3RSq2b3cmxYujwJLgc07s2ng0r84g1ujd28DfQ&amp;s=1\">www.SalsaNow.net<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Fthesalsaclubandbachata&amp;h=wAQEndQFg&amp;enc=AZPtQbHj4sTe6W2qgJdvOD5vS_JJWtchNIHBF_JHaOXjXK2Ppjwmqm16pu9-Yv8O2Ew&amp;s=1\">www.meetup.com\/thesalsaclubandbachata<\/a><\/p> <p>About Instructors:<\/p> <p>David Campos and Guida Rei<\/p> <p>David Campos, kizomba instructor, Dj and a promoter, is French\/Portuguese, he comes from Paris, France where he has been trained.

Since then he spread his love and knowledge for kizomba MAINLY IN NEW YORK CITY, but also all over the US &amp; Internationally throughout differents Festival, congresses and workshops.<\/p> <p>Of Franco-Portuguese descent, David is first and foremost impassioned by the stage, where he practiced for over 15 years as an actor and dancer, expanding his capacity for body language. Gradually this attention turned towards dance, mainly Latin, such as Cuban Salsa, but also the Kizomba . For him the body is able to express as much emotion as the voice. Since then, he seeks to find in those two complementary disciplines a way to transmit and share them with movement, precision, connection and grace.<\/p> <p>Guida Rei is Portuguese born and raised in Portugal. Together they bring their unique style, passion and kizomba dance skills to hundreds of dancers.<\/p> <p>David and Guida inspire the feeling, passion and connection the Kizomba Dance brings to live in the moment and to Follow the Beat of your Heartwhere the perfect synergy between two dancers gives birth to harmony, exaltation of senses and sensuality.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidcampos.fr%2F&amp;h=gAQElbnR8&amp;enc=AZNlomXMtdfrWqQ02jP2cADllA1_PmKDXoCeTz8LfACZDK48p9Ymcexf1yS04af8G9k&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidcampos.fr\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.davidcampos.fr\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Kaem and Marine<\/p> <p>For the 1st time in USA, these two are amazing dancers!

Washington Conference Center campus (up the hill), and it is a totally amazing building. Check it out:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/charlesbrickbauer.com\/images\/usfg1.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>To get to the venue, use the Smith street entrance (and not the entrance that weaves its way through the Mt. Washington Conference Center). See below map for detail.<\/p> <p><b>Parking<\/b><\/p> <p>Parking is plentiful and there's a lot right next to the building, with plenty of room for all attendees. And it's free. <b>Use the UPPER LOT.<\/b><\/p> <p>Leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p><b>DON'T PARK ON THE CURB IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - YOU WILL BE TOWED!<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation<\/b><\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM.

To win, players must stop enemy forces from building up as well as collect cards with which to fight the generals of each army. Ultimately each of the four generals must be defeated, usually by multiple players pooling their resources of cards which add dice or special powers. Defeating a general removes the risk of that army overrunning the capital and allows the player who landed the killing blow to automatically defeat minions of that army in future battles.

A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

Apache NiFi is a new Top-Level Apache project and is a dataflow platform designedwith Big Data and the IoT in mind. The project was developed for 8 years by the National Security Agency before it was granted to the Apache Software Foundation in November of 2014.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About the Speaker<\/b><\/p> <p>A dataflow enthusiast, Mark worked for several years as the Lead Developer for a platform that has revolutionized the way in which data is ingested, processed, tracked, and distributed throughout the NSA's Global Enterprise. In 2014, the U.S. Government open-sourced this platform as Apache NiFi. Since then, Mark has co-founded Onyara, Inc. (now Hortonworks). He now leverages Apache NiFi and lessons learned from working with one of the largest data-driven organizations in the world, to help other companies and organizations improve how they handle their ever-increasing volumes of data.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"https:\/\/jailbreakbrewing.com\/","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Apache-Spark-Maryland\/events\/225063316\/","yes_rsvp_count":113,"duration":10800000,"name":"Spark GraphX and Streaming","id":"225063316","time":1442955600000,"updated":1443123134000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409096659000,"name":"Apache Spark Maryland","group_lon":-76.7900009155,"id":16621912,"urlname":"Apache-Spark-Maryland","group_lat":39.1199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21076","country":"us","city":"Hanover","address_1":"7051 Arundel Mills Blvd","name":"Joe's Crab Shack Anne Arundel","lon":-76.719803,"id":9152972,"state":"MD","lat":39.155857,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.719622612,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442275685000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come out and indulge in a drink or two.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

It is about clearly specifying your requirements in advance and in detail, in fact, in code! But writing tests <i>before<\/i> you add a feature has other advantages as well. Anyone who has tried to write unit tests for existing code knows how difficult it can be -- often impossible without significant refactoring. But writing tests ahead of the code not only ensures that your code is indeed testable, but helps to keep your code concise, clean, and readable. Afterwards, the detailed tests you have created reap multiple benefits, including providing future programmers with detailed documentation as to how your code is supposed to be used.<\/p> <p>This meeting will include an introduction and demonstration of TDD. The presentation will use the Ruby programming language and the RSpec testing framework, but we may also have time to provide other examples in C# and\/or Java. However, regardless of your preferred platform, the principles presented in this meeting should help you get started with TDD or improve your TDD skills.<\/p> <p>The presentation will be led by Jeff Waltzer. Jeff has been a software developer for more than two decades and has been doing Ruby on Rails development for the past eight years. Since 2000 he has been an advocate for Agile development practices, including test-driven development and refactoring for clean simple code that is robust and easy to work on.<\/p> <p>We will meet at TEKsystems in Linthicum.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

Of course, Lucious is thrown for a loop when his fiery ex-wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) returns home following a long-term prison stint \u2014 one she endured after taking the fall for his illegal activities so that he could continue to build their empire. After being diagnosed with ALS, Lucious must decide which of his three sons \u2013 Andre (Trai Byers), Jamal (Jussie Smollett), or Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) \u2013 will take over the business. Every family member has their own agenda, and tensions quickly rise as the epic power struggle threatens to tear the Lyon family further apart. Who will be stopping by Empire this season?<\/p> <p>The Fox hit brought a number of big-name stars to its season one guest roster including Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige, and Snoop Dogg. The reported line-up for season two \u2013 so far \u2013 includes: Chris Rock, Pitbull, Alicia Keys, Lenny Kravitz, Marisa Tomei, Ludacris, Kelly Rowland, Al Sharpton, Andre Leon Talley, Swizz Beatz, and Ne-Yo.<\/p> <p>A new love interest for Cookie? Adam Rodriguez will be cozying up to our girl this season as recurring character Laz Delgado, a concert promoter and expert hustler.<\/p> <p>Additional casting includes Andre Royo (as reported by TVLine) and Tyra Ferrell (as reported by Deadline), who will both be featured in recurring roles.<\/p> <p>News circulated back in March that Oprah and Common would potentially guest star, though showrunner Ilene Chaiken noted in a recent interview with Deadline that as of now, she was not aware of any episodes featuring Oprah for season 2. Most recently, Smollett told People Mariah Carey would also make an appearance, though that has yet to be officially confirmed. Sources told EW at the time that while she would certainly be welcome, a deal had not yet been inked.<\/p> <p>What can fans expect this time around?<\/p> <p>Fox released the first full trailer in early August with a look at how the Lyon family is shaping up now that its patriarch is behind bars. Andre makes moves to remove his father as the CEO of Empire Entertainment, but Lucious has a few special instructions for his other son, Jamal. And as Cookie and Andre move forward with their own plans, Jamal and Hakeem just can\u2019t seem to get along \u2013 but what else is new?<\/p> <p>While the first season tackled a few timely industry happenings, some of the biggest stories of the summer, such as the Drake\/Meek Mill feud, will reportedly be incorporated into the next season. Fans will also be treated to more Cookie \u201chair moments\u201d as Henson told Andy Cohen during a recent interview: \u201dWe\u2019re incorporating blond, and not just in the flashbacks but in present time.\u201d<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Fierce-and-Fabulous-Divas\/events\/225091468\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":6300000,"name":"Empire Season 2 Premiere Party","id":"225091468","time":1443053700000,"updated":1443447361000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1362962335000,"name":"Fierce and Fabulous Divas","group_lon":-76.7699966431,"id":7554772,"urlname":"Fierce-and-Fabulous-Divas","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Fierce Divas"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21054","country":"us","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"740 Route 3","name":"Athletic Performance Inc","lon":-76.663811,"id":11010062,"state":"MD","lat":39.051575,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"distance":16.6738166809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1435081492000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NEW TIME UNTIL THE SPRING - 9PM - 11PM \u00a0(pass the word to everyone)<\/p> <p>We will be running a small drop n play Wednesday night.<\/p> <p>The playing surface will be on the turf.<\/p> <p>We have pinnies available.

L. Stedman.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Synopsis<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\nAfter four harrowing years on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns to Australia and takes a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day\u2019s journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby\u2019s cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nTom, who keeps meticulous records and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel insists the baby is a \u201cgift from God,\u201d and against Tom\u2019s judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nM. L. Stedman\u2019s mesmerizing, beautifully written novel seduces us into accommodating Isabel\u2019s decision to keep this \u201cgift from God.\u201d And we are swept into a story about extraordinarily compelling characters seeking to find their North Star in a world where there is no right answer, where justice for one person is another\u2019s tragic loss. \u00a0The Light Between Oceans\u00a0is exquisite and unforgettable, a deeply moving novel.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Book Availability at the Howard Count Public Library<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>The Light Between Oceans<\/b> is available for checkout at the Howard County Public Library. The Howard County Public Library has:<\/p> <p>(39) Copies of the book; 345 pages.<\/p> <p>(4) ebook copies.<\/p> <p>(1) Copies as a sound file.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Howard County Library, Savage Branch<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n9525 Durness Lane<\/p> <p>Laurel, MD 2072<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Discussion Questions<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n1. Discuss the novel\u2019s title,\u00a0The Light Between Oceans. Why do you think the author selected this title? What do you visualize when you hear or read\u00a0The Light Between Oceans?<\/p> <p>2. The novel is rich with detailed descriptions of the ocean, the sky, and the wild landscape of Janus Rock. Is there a particular passage or scene that stood out to you? What role does the natural world play in Tom and Isabel\u2019s life?<\/p> <p>3. \u201cThe isolation spins its mysterious cocoon, focusing the mind on one place, one time, one rhythm\u2014the turning of the light. The island knows no other human voices, no other footprints. On the Offshore Lights you can live any story you want to tell yourself, and no one will say you\u2019re wrong: not the seagulls, not the prisms, not the wind.\u201d (page 110) Discuss the impact of living in seclusion on both Tom and Isabel. Why do you think each of them is drawn to live on Janus Rock? Do you think, in the moments when we are unobserved, we are different people?<\/p> <p>4. When Isabel tries to get Tom to open up about his family, he responds: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you really want. It\u2019s just I\u2019d rather not. Sometimes it\u2019s good to leave the past in the past.\u201d(pages 44-45) Do you think it is possible to leave the past in the past? What do you think of Tom\u2019s opinion that it\u2019s a \u201cpity\u201d that we\u2019re a product of our family\u2019s past? What does this tell you about his character? Discuss the impact of family history on Tom, Isabel, Hannah, and Frank.<\/p> <p>5. Tom is haunted by what he witnessed\u2014and what he did\u2014during his enlistment in World War I. The narrator reflects that he\u2019s not \u201cone of the men whose legs trailed by a hank of sinews, or whose guts cascaded from their casing like slithering eels\u2026.But he\u2019s scarred all the same, having to live in the same skin as the man who did the things that needed to be done back then.\u201d (page 10) How do you think Tom\u2019s experiences as a soldier impact his decisions throughout the novel? What other outside elements, like the war, influences the narrative?<\/p> <p>6. Janus Rock is named for Janus, the Roman God of doorways, \u201calways looking both ways, torn between two ways of seeing things.\u201d (page 65) How does this knowledge impact your reading ofThe Light Between Oceans? Who is \u201ctorn between two ways of seeing things\u201d?<\/p> <p>7. Discuss the theme of opposites in\u00a0The Light Between Oceans\u2014darkness and light; safety and danger; land and water; truth and lies. How do these opposing forces shape your reading?<\/p> <p>8. When Isabel brings Tom the map of Janus, complete with new names for all the locations on the island, Tom has an interesting reaction: \u201cJanus did not belong to him: he belonged to it, like he\u2019d heard the natives thought of the land. His job was just to take care of it.\u201d (page 62) Discuss the difference in Tom\u2019s point of view compared to Isabel\u2019s. Does this difference in opinion foreshadow future events? How does it relate to their conflicting opinions of what to do with Lucy?<\/p> <p>9. Did you sense that the silver rattle might turn out to play a pivotal role in the story?<\/p> <p>10. Tom believes that rules are vital, that they are what keep a man from becoming a savage. Do you agree with him?<\/p> <p>11. Which characters won your sympathy and why? Did this change over the course of the novel? Did your notion of what was best or right shift in the course of your reading?<\/p> <p>12. Tom and Isabel\u2019s deception impacts the lives of everyone around them. What did you think of the other characters\u2019 reactions when they discover the truth about Lucy? Consider Hannah, Gwen, Septimus, Isabel\u2019s parents, Ralph, Bluey.<\/p> <p>13. Discuss Hannah\u2019s reunion with Grace. Do you think she had fair expectations? Did you agree with Dr. Sumpton\u2019s advice to Hannah about completely cutting Lucy off from Isabel and Tom?<\/p> <p>14. M.L. Stedman makes it clear that there is no one perfect answer to the question of who should raise Grace\/Lucy. She seems to undermine all notions of absolutes. It is clear that she will not dismiss all Germans as evil either. There is Hannah\u2019s husband, ripe for persecution, and yet he is utterly innocent. Discuss the places in the novel where easy certainty turns out to be wrong.<\/p> <p>15. Were you surprised by Isabel\u2019s final decision to admit her role in the choice to keep Lucy\u2014freeing Tom, but losing her child forever? Why or why not? What would you have done?<\/p> <p>16. What did you think of the conclusion of the novel? What emotions did you feel at the story\u2019s end? Did it turn out as you expected? Were you satisfied?<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We meet in the Carl Sagan conference room.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/columbia-meetup-book-club\/events\/224982441\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"September Book Club Meeting","id":"224982441","time":1443133800000,"updated":1443206520000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1193699468000,"name":"Columbia Book Club","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":783965,"urlname":"columbia-meetup-book-club","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Book Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21014","country":"us","city":"Bel Air","phone":"410--838-3178","address_1":"1200 E Churchville Rd","name":"St. Matthew's Lutheran Church","lon":-76.326485,"id":217277,"state":"MD","lat":39.543415,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":23.5435085297,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440420780000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Please join us for Bel Air Toastmasters, every Thursday at 7pm, at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, inside of their chapel (faces Rt 22).

I've attached the review of this gem by Jamie Ford, the New York Times bestselling author of Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.<br\/>Some books change us. They change the way we look at ourselves, the way we interact with those closest to our hearts--the way we\u2019ve loved those people, or the way we\u2019ve missed them or honored them or taken them hopelessly for granted. This is one of those books. This is a book that alters the way we remember.<\/p> <p>I\u2019m an author, so this is where my own writerly fail-safes kick-in, warning of hype and hyperbole...but even in reflection...I\u2019m not speaking falsely.<\/p> <p>Please Look After Mom isn\u2019t merely a story of familial loss and longing, of the many veils of shame and surrender beneath one roof. This tale is a door, and once you cross its threshold, you\u2019ll never be able to go back to that comfortable place you came from. Your perceptions will be transformed. Permanently.<\/p> <p>When Park So-nyo, an elderly mother from a rural town visiting her children on her birthday, vanishes over the event horizon of a crowded Seoul train station, four narratives unfold--four dimensions of loss, anger, blame, and sacrifice--four angles of persistence. (Perhaps it\u2019s no mere coincidence that the number four in Korean is a homonym for \u201cdeath.\u201d)<\/p> <p>But as the four pillars of one family are shaken by this mysterious disappearance, we are also enriched as we learn about the wealth of emotional currency that has been exchanged over one lifetime--tender payments, and the debts owed, from children to parent, from husband to wife, from an aged mother to...herself.<\/p> <p>This book is four stories, four echoes, four promises, and four lamentations--that make a whole.<\/p> <p>This is your gentle warning, dear reader.<\/p> <p>And an invitation, to the kind of book I wish I could read again for the first time.<\/p> <p>Books will be in the shop Thursday!<br\/>Hope to see you there!<br\/>Jinny<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Annapolis-Bookstore-Book-Club-The-Drunkards-Walk\/events\/225044639\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Please Look After Mom by Kyung-Sook Shin","id":"225044639","time":1443135600000,"updated":1443147742000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1424799003000,"name":"Annapolis Bookstore Bibliophiles and The Drunkard's Walk","group_lon":-76.5100021362,"id":18458279,"urlname":"Annapolis-Bookstore-Book-Club-The-Drunkards-Walk","group_lat":39,"who":"Bibliophiles"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"Gambrills","address_1":"1506 Defense Hwy","name":"Elks Lodge","lon":-76.683044,"id":23569420,"lat":38.992088,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.9017124176,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422341678000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Friends,<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0 I will be hosting a dance every Thursday for our Bowie Ballroom, Latin, Swing meet up at he Bowie Elks Lodge.

She locks her huge brown eyes with a client\u2019s and asks directly, but respectfully, \u201cDo you really need this? Why? How does it make you feel when I take it away?\u201d And very occasionally, when a person seems unreasonably attached to a shopping bag of old birthday cards or an ugly ashtray pilfered from a restaurant in Greece, she pulls out the tough love: \u201cAre you going to give me trouble with this?\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>As the host of the Discovery Home Channel\u2019s hit show\u00a0Neat, Buttigieg provides clutter control and guidance to a new household every week. She\u2019s something between an organizer and a headshrinker, with certifications as a professional organizer and as a life coach. She simultaneously cleans out closets while slowly uncovering subconscious \u201cblocks\u201d that make a person want to hoard junk or prevent them from putting their dirty clothes in the hamper.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Her gentle leadership made a lifelong fan out of client Denise Fujiwara, who says Buttigieg \u201cis a living example of what you can do with an affirmative attitude.\u201d The Toronto-based choreographer was lost trying to sort out her home office to make room for a house renovation when she called in Buttigieg to help. As someone who runs her own choreography business and dance troupe, Fujiwara\u2019s office is prone to clutter. \u201cMy office was a horrendous mess,\u201d she says. She describes stacks of boxes, piles of unfiled papers, photographs, video tapes, press releases \u2013 essentially 15 years\u2019 worth of disorder and confusion.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tried to sort it out in the past, but I hadn\u2019t had the skills to do it properly until I worked with Hellen. In about 6 hours, she did what I couldn\u2019t do in 15 years,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The two went around the room in an orderly way, starting at the door and working clockwise. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d get stuck on something, and she\u2019d push me to make a decision,\u201d says Fujiwara. \u201cShe pushed through, and in the end I felt euphoric to be relieved of all that stuff.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg unloads stuff with a dancer\u2019s grace and a politician\u2019s diplomacy. Anyone would think she was born taking charge of people\u2019s unruly environs, teaching them how to be better organized. In a way, that\u2019s true. She says she was always organized, even as a teenager, when most kids live among piles of laundry, music collections and notebooks. She was also always a confident speaker. In grammar school, she was the girl who narrated the school plays.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In fact, Buttigieg moves and speaks so naturally in front of the camera and with such calm assertiveness, no one would guess that not long ago she was at a loss for what to do with her life.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI had been out of the workforce for almost 10 years as a stay-at-home mom, but I lacked confidence, and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says from her home in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She graduated from Seneca College in Toronto with a degree in radio and television broadcasting, and worked briefly as an administrator and fitness instructor. But then she had two children and took off nearly 10 years from work to raise them. Those 10 years at home had slowly whittled away her confidence as a businessperson, but she still wanted to launch a new career \u2013 and have some adult conversation. Her solution? In 1999, she joined City Centre Toastmasters.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cToastmasters changed my life,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/p> <p>She means that in the most literal sense. It started with one of the first lessons any new Toastmaster learns: talk about what you know. Buttigieg started writing speeches about what she knew, and as someone who was naturally neat, she talked about organizing. And then at one contest she gave a speech called \u201cSimple Simon\u201d about simplifying your life by letting go of clutter, and it launched a new career.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cGiving speeches is a journey of self-discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cHow often in life do people really listen to us? At Toastmasters, people are truly listening; they\u2019re not thinking about what they\u2019ll say back. It\u2019s a safe place to speak, so I could use my speeches to work out what resonated with the audience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>And also what resonated with her. That speech was the nugget that now sits at the center of her professional life. In fact, she still uses parts of the same speech today when she gives presentations: \u201cIf you would like to get a taste of the simple life, don\u2019t let\u00a0stuff\u00a0complicate it. Commit to following these three simple steps: If you don\u2019t use it, lose it; if you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t buy it; and when you bring one item in, take one item out.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>This would become her mantra in several ways. It sparked her desire to become a life coach and also tapped into her abilities as an organizer. Starting her own organizing business, called WeOrganizeU, helped pay for the life-coaching certification. Soon, a group of producers approached her about a new show that would blend her gifts for tidying up with her ability to lead people, and by 2004\u00a0Neat\u00a0hit the North American airwaves.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Buttigieg credits Toastmasters with more than just sparking a good idea; she also says she honed her skills as a leader and built confidence. Shalini Alleluia, president of City Centre Toastmasters, says Buttigieg faced a short learning curve thanks to her take-charge attitude.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cHellen had lots of energy and was articulate and vibrant,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe always smiled and was willing to try anything.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>Alleluia says even though Buttigieg was a new member, she asked her to chair a speech contest and encouraged her to assume meeting roles. Soon Buttigieg was helping others to be better speakers.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u201cI think Hellen was more of a mentor to other people than other people being a mentor to her,\u201d Alleluia says. \u201cShe has a charisma that makes people want to follow her and to be like her in personality and capability. She\u2019s a good listener, and she always pays attention to the evaluation notes.

For those interested in performing, sign-up is at 6:00 pm and live performances begin at 6:30 pm.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe War &amp; Treaty\u201d will debut as the featured act for this event. Complementing their pure sound and exceptional musical talent, The War and Treaty experience includes one of our world\u2019s greatest yet lost art forms; the art form of Story-Telling. Each song is filled with experiences ranging from Michael writing on the banks of the Euphrates River while serving in the US Army in Baghdad, Iraq, to Tanya sharing stories about having one of the greatest producer\/song writers of our time, Arif Mardin, compose a song just for her, or having tea time with Julie Andrews, Whoopi Goldberg, and the late James Colburn while filming on the set of the hit movie Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit. The War &amp; Treaty is a sensational act and their performances are moving and memorable! Be sure to catch this act!<\/p> <p>The Open Mic will be hosted in the Gunpowder Room or on the covered deck when the weather is pleasant. The Gunpowder Room is a rustic, intimate structure carved from the remnants of an 1850\u2019s carriage building. It room provides an excellent setting for performers and listeners.<\/p> <p>For this event, Woodhall\u2019s in-house caterer will prepare special lite-fare menu selections and serve wine, sangria and soft drinks. Treat yourself to a relaxing evening of food, wine and musical performances.

By her side was her husband, Robb (known as Crash Test Dumb Ass in the Hash World) \u2013 it has been a journey that they have traveled together. The surgery saved Lynne\u2019s life, but came at a high price for Lynne and Robb out of pocket due to complications from the surgery and now Lynne is in kidney failure. She has been told by her doctors that she will probably need a kidney transplant in the near future. Lynne worked full time until three months before her lung transplant. After the transplant, she was \u201cspending more time in the hospital than at home\u201d so her career stopped. Due to her kidney issues and other complications from cystic fibrosis, she is now unable to work. Through friends and relatives money has been raised to support this courageous couple. But there is still a need for more money. You can help.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

The Waterman's Restaurant next door has a fantastic menu for dinner, and\u00a0music on Sat. night.

If it turns out that there is no space for you, your fee will be returned. If you cancel less than 72 hours prior to the trip, you are still obligated to pay the fee, since CSA has to pay for the marina slips and motel.<\/p> <p>This event is for paid CSA Organization members only.

Please observe the festival's rules: No pets, no weapons (even costume), and no non-contract performances are permitted.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/f\/7\/a\/event_60344922.jpeghttp:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/8\/9\/event_49142441.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>*While this is an open event, and guests and friends are welcome, IF you commit to participating in the carpool and fail to show up at the allotted time to depart or return, you will be counted as a no-show.

If you no-show after committing to drive others in carpool without sufficient advanced notice to make alternative arrangements, then you may be removed from the group (barring special and emergency circumstances, of course).

Participants are asked to bring their drums to class with them. Drums are also available to borrow in class.<\/p> <p>Jaqui's Bio:<br\/>Jaqui MacMillan discovered her passion for African drumming thirty years ago. Over a span of fifteen years, she studied privately with many African drum masters and at the Tam Tam Mandingue School in Washington, DC. She began sharing her joy of drumming with others by performing, teaching classes and facilitating community drum circles. For over twenty years, Jaqui has taught thousands of students across the USA, both privately and through her Drum For Joy!\u2122 workshops. Jaqui has performed and recorded with some of the top names in the business and has an extensive discography. The Washington Area Music Association, (WAMA), awarded her the \"World Music Instrumentalist Award\" every year from 1995 through 2002. Jaqui has facilitated drum circles for hundreds of conferences, corporate team building events, elementary and high schools, hospitals, programs for \u201cat risk\u201d children, juvenile detention centers and programs for homeless and battered women. She is a founding board member of the Drum Circle Facilitators Guild (DCFG), an organization dedicated to professionalism in the field of drum circle facilitation. After twenty years in Washington, DC, Jaqui moved to Westminster, MD where she created Magnolia House Arts, Crafts &amp; Music Studios. She is also the director of The Drum For Joy!\u2122 Orchestra<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"(410) 775-8237 or   Email Kim at Fairyfreshfarm111@gmail.com","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/andsoitis\/events\/224789678\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":10800000,"name":"Drum for Joy Workshop!","id":"224789678","time":1443286800000,"updated":1443300190000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409763879000,"name":"And So It Is....

If you\u2019ve ever wanted to start meditating, but didn\u2019t know how, this is the class for you! Held once\/month at KMC Maryland, this introduction is designed for beginners so that you can have a personal experience of meditation and inner peace.<\/p> <p><br\/>The purpose of meditation is to make our mind calm and peaceful. If our mind is peaceful, we will be free from worries and mental discomfort, and so we will experience true happiness; but if our mind is not peaceful, we will find it very difficult to be happy, even if we are living in the very best conditions. If we train in meditation, our mind will gradually become more and more peaceful, and we will experience a purer and purer form of happiness. Eventually, we will be able to stay happy all the time, even in the most difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>Usually we find it difficult to control our mind. It seems as if our mind is like a balloon in the wind \u2013 blown here and there by external circumstances. If things go well, our mind is happy, but if they go badly, it immediately becomes unhappy. For example, if we get what we want, such as a new possession or a new partner, we become excited and cling to them tightly. We are like a child making a sand castle who is excited when it is first made, but who becomes upset when it is destroyed by the incoming tide. By training in meditation, we create an inner space and clarity that enables us to control our mind regardless of the external circumstances. Gradually we develop mental equilibrium, a balanced mind that is happy all the time, rather than an unbalanced mind that oscillates between the extremes of excitement and despondency.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/events.constantcontact.com\/register\/event?llr=9veapdsab&amp;oeidk=a07ebiatxhua83ca42e\"><b>Registration\u00a0here!<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>Walk-ins welcome.\u00a0Cost: $12 \/ $8 for students, seniors 60+, unemployed.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/KMC-Maryland\/events\/225356689\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Introduction to Mindfulness and Meditation","id":"225356689","time":1443290400000,"updated":1443297972000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1328837005000,"name":"Kadampa Meditation Center Maryland","group_lon":-76.6100006104,"id":3267012,"urlname":"KMC-Maryland","group_lat":39.3300018311,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":13.8469734192,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441143553000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Come join Rodney as he gives his lecture and Power Point Presentation: Ghost\u00a0 Modern Paranormal Techniques and Equipment.

Usui Reiki has been passed on from Master to Student for many, many years. The Reiki Teacher acts as a channel for the Reiki energy to pass to the student. During the this sacred ceremony, the Reiki Master will touch the students head, shoulders, and hands and use one or more special breathing techniques. During the attunement, some students feel warmth in the hands, others may see colors or have visions of spiritual beings. However, it is not necessary to have an inner experience for the attunement to have worked. Most simply feel more relaxed or peaceful.

Rosie Ferguson is seventeen and ready to enjoy the summer before her senior year of high school. She's intelligent-she aced AP physics; athletic-a former state-ranked tennis doubles champion; and beautiful. She is, in short, everything her mother, Elizabeth, hoped she could be. The family's move to Landsdale, with stepfather James in tow, hadn't been as bumpy as Elizabeth feared. But as the school year draws to a close, there are disturbing signs that the life Rosie claims to be leading is a sham, and that Elizabeth's hopes for her daughter to remain immune from the pull of the darker impulses of drugs and alcohol are dashed. Slowly and against their will, Elizabeth and James are forced to confront the fact that Rosie has been lying to them-and that her deceptions will have profound consequences. This is Anne Lamott's most honest and heartrending novel yet, exploring our human quest for connection and salvation as it reveals the traps that can befall all of us.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55\/events\/224996154\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Let's Read & Discuss a Book:  Imperfect Birds by Anne Lamott","id":"224996154","time":1443360600000,"updated":1443406509000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1422713755000,"name":"Towson Area Inquisitive Women over 55","group_lon":-76.5800018311,"id":18398926,"urlname":"Towson-Area-Inquisitive-Women-over-55","group_lat":39.4099998474,"who":"Curious women over 55."},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":12.586265564,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421620159000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0Please come out and join us in helping to walk, nurture, and help train a number of rescue dogs that are located at the Tail End Kennel in Reisterstown. \u00a0While this can be a fun and extremely gratifying activity, \u00a0safety is of the utmost importance.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u00a0<b>Due to liability, the management asks that you don't bring children, or your own dogs out to the kennel. \u00a0Thanks for your understanding.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Keira<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/4\/0\/600_415656672.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Watson<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/c\/f\/2\/600_415656082.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Karly<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/8\/f\/6\/600_431743254.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Bandit<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/2\/4\/600_431743300.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Lucky<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/e\/0\/600_433134240.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Christopher<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/3\/7\/f\/600_433134143.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Twinkie<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/c\/e\/e\/600_436819694.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Chevy<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/c\/f\/600_434851951.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Reds<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/b\/a\/600_439271450.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Gretta<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/e\/f\/600_439271247.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Domino<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/1\/1\/600_439271281.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Maryland-Rescue-Dog-Walkers-Group\/events\/225272387\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":9000000,"name":"Sunday  New Volunteer Orientation and\/or regular dog walker sign up,","id":"vmmwdlytmbkc","time":1443362400000,"updated":1443373875000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330101247000,"name":"Maryland Rescue Animals Care Group","group_lon":-76.7699966431,"id":3357142,"urlname":"Maryland-Rescue-Dog-Walkers-Group","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Volunteers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21131","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"12460 Dulaney valley road 21131","name":"corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road","lon":-76.546143,"id":7931402,"state":"MD","lat":39.468628,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.9834098816,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1411925238000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/6\/e\/event_139181582.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>One of the best kept secrets here just north of Towson is the public access to a \"protected\" area of Loch Raven Reservoir park on the weekend.\u00a0 On both Saturday and Sunday, park police close off Loch Raven Drive (some maps call it Loch Raven Rd.) between Morgan Mill Road and Providence Road. The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road.

However, the Ravens play at 1p.m. \u00a0on the 27th, and no one relevant is playing at 8:30 that night (unless you think the Broncos and the Lions are relevant. but you'd be wrong...)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>So....here's the NYT review of Odds Against Tomorrow. I'll be posting a poll soon for our next set of books:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Natural calamity has long occupied a central role in our stories; there\u2019s a pretty good one about a guy escaping a flood with some animals on a boat. After this past fall, expect several more, with Nathaniel Rich and his intelligent, exhaustively researched second novel, \u201cOdds Against Tomorrow,\u201d at the vanguard of post-Sandy catastrophe lit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Rich is no arriviste. Not only has he been writing nonfiction articles on similar subjects for years, but according to publicity materials, galleys of his prescient book, whose cover depicts Manhattan underwater, were delivered when his publisher\u2019s offices reopened after Sandy\u2019s devastation. (Rich also made some technical revisions after the storm to reflect reality more accurately.)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The hero of \u201cOdds Against Tomorrow\u201d is Mitchell Zukor, a peerless disaster forecaster, the world\u2019s best worst-case \u00adscenarist. In the novel\u2019s near-future, semi-alternate universe that could easily pass for 2013, an earthquake leveled Seattle while Mitchell was in college. Firms are now concerned about disaster-induced losses, since, in this fictional rendering, insurance companies stopped offering catastrophe coverage after 2001. Mitchell lands a postgraduate job as a low-level quantitative analyst at a financial monolith, Fitzsimmons Sherman, where he is assigned to the Department of Equities, Assets and Derivatives \u2014 he notices the morbid acronym only some time into his tenure. His first task is calculating the price tag for each employee\u2019s life; his is a mere $266,213.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>It\u2019s a perfect grunt job for this natural-born worrywart, who never met a silver lining on whose dark cloud he couldn\u2019t fixate. Fearing the worst \u2014 and, perversely, hoping it will come true \u2014 is all that provides meaning for Mitchell, a compulsively neurotic, friendless solitary: \u201cIf you devoted your life to the contemplation of disaster,\u201d he wonders, \u201cthen wasn\u2019t an incident-free existence an empty one?\u201d Woody Allen has made a career out of such musings (as has the author\u2019s brother, the comedy writer Simon Rich, to whom this book is sweetly dedicated).<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The novel is narrated in the third person, although it uses an unnecessary framing device of a Wall Street Journal reporter and former classmate to tell it. Rich is himself best known for his high-profile reportage for The New York Times, Harper\u2019s and other publications, and his precise, journalistic prose is that of, in Saul Bellow\u2019s words, \u201ca first-class noticer.\u201d On Mitchell\u2019s titan-of-industry boss at his first job: \u201cHe had that animal\u2019s dangerous, false languor in his eyes, a stare that lulled its object into quiescence before, all of a sudden, it attacked. Sherman saved his fangs for those further up the food chain, but Mitchell still viewed him with the quaking insecurity of a grazing imbecilic herbivore.\u201d Or this repulsive catalog of teeming life Mitchell later observes inside a tree: \u201ca flesh-colored worm as long as his arm; a fiery procession of red mites snaking between piles of school-bus-\u00adyellow spores and thick, translucent bubbles of slime; a downy pink fungus like a speck of cotton candy.\u201d Flesh-colored, fiery red, school-bus yellow, cotton-candy pink: this is the palette of both a first-class noticer and wordsmith.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>I\u2019m not spoiling anything the cover doesn\u2019t by revealing that a storm does arrive, called Tammy, making Mitchell\u2019s dire premonitions come true and turning him into a media star, the Nate Silver of his field. Rich homes in on the profoundly American exploitation of fear for profit. Though \u201cOdds Against Tomorrow\u201d is not directly about the terror-mongering years of Bush and Cheney, it\u2019s a byproduct of them and of contemporary culture, from overhyped foreign threats that boost sales of helicopters, to $40,000 nursery schools that prey on helicopter parents.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The second half of the book pivots from this highly intellectualized, DeLillo-meets-Dreiser interrogation of our psychoses and portrait of a young striver into something of an action-adventure narrative backed up by a wealth of scientifically plausible developments. Mitchell and his colleague and paramour, Jane, brave the rising tides of the city and beyond while Rich deftly sidesteps political critique \u2014 no charges of presidents not caring about minorities \u2014 with the exception of illustrating FEMA\u2019s ineptitude. Instead, we see citizens banding together as best they can while Mitchell goes on a quest to reunite with the elusive Elsa and, in the process, undergoes a significant \u00adtransformation.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Before that, however, he\u2019s a less than fully engaging protagonist. \u201cHe sometimes wondered whether he could remember details about emergencies more vividly than anecdotes from college or childhood,\u201d we\u2019re told, and at points the book, in both its emotionally detached language and its focus, does read like one of Rich\u2019s essayistic forays, and not a novel about a flesh-and-blood character with affective responses besides fear. Depending on your perspective, this can be an asset or a shortcoming. From one representative section:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cManhattan\u2019s highest natural elevation was Bennett Park, an outcropping of schist in Washington Heights, 268 feet above sea level. . . . A fault line ran across 125th Street and any day could trigger a magnitude 6 earthquake. Mitchell memorized the Richter scale and its equivalencies. An earthquake measuring 4.0 was equivalent to the detonation of a small atomic bomb.\u201d<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The exacting, quantifiable details continue for another full page, with a lone insight into Mitchell: He is \u201cterrified\u201d by the tornado-like phenomenon of microbursts \u2014 an expected response for this fraidy-cat. As a result, when the story takes a more harrowing turn, I never quite believed that life and death were truly at stake, for either Mitchell or New York, and didn\u2019t find myself as engrossed by Elsa\u2019s fate or the frisson with Jane as Rich asks us to be.

If you can bring a core game please list that with your RSVP so we can expand the number of player seats.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Adventure 0-2 - A Pirate's Life<\/b><\/p> <p>Yo ho! A pirate\u2019s life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there\u2019s more to a pirate\u2019s life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what\u2019s fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate\u2019s Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain\u2019s orders, every captain has to answer to the council.<\/p> <p>Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that\u2019s not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there\u2019s power, there\u2019s intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You\u2019ll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you\u2019ll attract a host of powerful enemies.<\/p> <p>If you can\u2019t earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won\u2019t ask questions. They\u2019ve got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.\u00a0<\/p> <p>According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there\u2019s chum in the water, you\u2019ll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you\u2019re eager to earn her patronage, then you\u2019d best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>A few notes about ACG OP:<\/b><\/p> <p>1.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long).

This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

Lol<\/p> <p>Hello All! I have finally gotten a new location for this rescheduled Meetup to expand our practice.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Let's make more money by doing what we love! I was recently told Jeff Young, the founding father of the MD Chapter of the AMTA, used to say, \"At any given time, there is a new client 10 feet away from us\". Isn't that true when we are out and about? It's called networking. We have the privilege of having another founding father of one of the biggest business networking organizations in the state of Maryland, speak with us about what it means for our business\/practice to network. His name is Jerry Schwartz. Jerry is one of the most positive, nicest and unstoppable people I know! He assisted us, myself and Bill Pearce, in establishing the Downtown Chapter of BNI, Business Networking International, back in the late 90's. After we got going, I doubled my income through this illustrious group of businessmen and women. Jerry has agreed to share the wealth of why and how networking is so vital to building our massage practices. Also, if you are hungry, Barcocina (www.barcocina.com) has a very interesting menu to select from .\u00a0 Again,\u00a0Jerry Schwartz usually gets $500 per speaking engagement and he is doing this for us for no charge. Therefore, I don't want to abuse the privilege of having him speak to such a small crowd. \u00a0If we do not get a reasonable response, I will cancel again, assuming that this is not a topic everyone is interested in.

And it's free. What can be better? One favor, tho -- leave the few visitor spots that are right in front of the building available for the use of the offices. They have some elderly clients who aren't able to walk up the walkway to the building. The lot is really big and very close so you shouldn't need those spots anyways.<\/p> <p>Public Transportation<\/p> <p>The Mt. Washington campus is located very conveniently near the Light Rail stop, which is literally just down the hill from the venue. Get off at the Mt. Washington Light Rail station, and then climb the steps to the Octagon Building at Mt. Washington and from there you can get to the DLA Piper building. It's a 15-20 minute walk at most.<\/p> <p>There are also shuttles from the JHU Homewood and JHMI campuses right to the Mt. Washington Conference center, including one that leaves at 7:40AM from Homewood getting in by 8AM, and leaving at 9:35AM to return to Homewood. Very convenient.<\/p> <p><b>Consent to Recording and Photography<\/b> By attending this event, you consent to having yourself and\/or your presentation video recorded and\/or photographed by the TechBreakfast organizers and\/or anyone else attending.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:<\/p> <p><br\/>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!
