Her photos are references to a past epoch, a final look back. In the exhibition at the German Consulate General in New York 40 photos will be on display from March 3 \u2013 April 15.<\/p> <p>Sabine von Breunig works exceed the purely documentary. Her photographs make the atmosphere of the shown spaces perceptible, they impress by an artistic look, the subtle handling of light and the almost abstract appearing composition of color and structure.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe headquarters of the American Forces in Berlin was one of the hot spots of the Cold War. Here, history was made and substantial contributions towards international understanding and to the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany were achieved. This was where General Lucius D. Clay initialized the famous Berlin \u201aLuftbr\u00fccke\u2019 with which 2 million citizens of Berlin were given necessary supplies from the air. US-presidents and famous decision makers visited the headquarters in Berlin, including President John F. Kennedy. His remarks made in berlin are legendary: \u201cAll free men wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words: Ich bin ein Berliner!\u201d<\/p> <p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, within the scope of the reunification of Germany, the allied sovereignty in Berlin expired on October 3rd, 1990, the era of the military governors came \u00a0to an end, and their administrations closed down. After nearly 50 years of residency, the Americans handed their headquarters back to the German Federal Republic.<\/p> <p>The area has been lying idle since 1994 and has only been sporadically used as backdrop for Hollywood film productions. \u201cInglorious Bastards\u201d starring Brad Pitt and \u201cOperation Valkyrie\u201d with Tom Cruise were shot here.<\/p> <p>In May 2011, the five hectar property was sold for 15 million Euros to an investor and the seven for-preservation buildings were remodeled into luxury flats and the signs of history vanished.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>About the artist<\/b><\/p> <p>Sabine von Breunig attended the master class of Prof. Arno Fischer, Berlin. Her work has been shown in Berlin, K\u00f6ln and New York.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713538\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713538","time":1457046000000,"updated":1457050873000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"150 Kenilworth Pl, ","name":"Caffe Bene","lon":-73.948845,"id":24314847,"state":"NY","lat":40.632328,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.42862319946,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452719457000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Caffe Bene is a new, delicious atmosphere on Kenilworth, right across the street from the back of Brooklyn College. \u00a0It's also near the Junction of Flatbush Ave and Nostrand Ave, and the 2 and 5 trains.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We'll probably be towards the back of the store (furthest from cashiers).

As the Director of Digital Innovation at Macmillan Learning, he is leveraging his broad skill set and experience to help the organization accelerating it's learning, reduce risk and identifying opportunity. Part of this success has been through meticulously introducing a much more consumer centric approach to product development. Inspired by the Lean Startup movement, Design Thinking, and several other problem-solving frameworks, he has designed various tools to help create a process that is both flexible and repeatable. This has resulted in a positive shift in culture, where ideas are placed in front of customers quickly, and the learning loop starts almost immediately.<\/p> <p>During this session, Alex will introduce how he runs Product Design Sprints at Macmillan Learning. Design Sprints have been a hot topic, sparked by the talented individuals at Google Ventures, that combine pieces of agile, lean startup and design thinking.

Minnesota student Joe Talbert discovers this when he is tasked with writing a senior citizen\u2019s biography for a college English class. Short on options and time, Joe heads to Hillview Manor nursing home in search of potential subjects. There he meets Carl Iverson, a dying Vietnam vet who\u2019s out on parole after serving a 30-year sentence for the rape and murder of 14-year-old Crystal Hagen. Joe dreads writing his story: \u201cI had come to Hillview looking for a hero, and instead, found a villain.\u201d<\/p> <p>But the man whom his research reveals is far from a one-dimensional bad guy. Joe meets Carl\u2019s army buddy, Virgil, who witnessed Carl\u2019s acts of heroism and insists that his friend is no killer. Then Joe spots a telling detail from an old crime scene photo\u2014one that was overlooked at the trial. He begins to suspect there\u2019s much more to the story than the secretive old man is telling him. But if Carl didn\u2019t murder Crystal, why did he never proclaim his innocence? What really happened to him in Vietnam? And is the real killer still walking free?<\/p> <p>Joe turns amateur sleuth, aided by his attractive but standoffish neighbor, Lila. Then his mother is jailed for DUI, leaving him to care for his autistic brother. As his search for clues becomes more dangerous, he begins to wonder if he\u2019ll have to choose between college and the claims of family. Allan Eskens\u2019 compulsively suspenseful first novel reveals that guilt takes many forms\u2014and that getting the story right is essential.(bookpage review)<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MysteryBookClub\/events\/228640618\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"The Life We Bury, By Allen Eskens","id":"228640618","time":1457047800000,"updated":1457361874000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1189739629000,"name":"The New York Mystery Book Club","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":683131,"urlname":"MysteryBookClub","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Mystery Fiction Fans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"11 Times Square (42nd St @ 8th Avenue)","name":"Microsoft","lon":-73.98555,"id":18309292,"state":"NY","lat":40.757809,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.588667094707,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450892290000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>NOTE: ALL ATTENDEES MUST REGISTER ON EVENTBRITE TO GET PAST SECURITY -\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/class-writing-for-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-game-worlds-tickets-20107146015\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/class-writing-for-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-game-worlds-tickets-20107146015\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/class-writing-for-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-game-worlds-tickets-20107146015<\/a><\/a><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/a\/9\/a\/600_438023194.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Class: Writing for Sci-Fi, Fantasy &amp; Horror Game Worlds<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Thursday, March 3rd @ 6:30pm<br\/>Microsoft (11 Times Square)<\/p> <p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/class-writing-for-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-game-worlds-tickets-20107146015\">Register here!<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>Visit <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/class-writing-for-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-game-worlds-tickets-20107146015\">Eventbrite<\/a><\/b>\u00a0to see the class description, lesson plan, and to purchase a ticket.<\/p> <p>Seats are limited.\u00a0<\/p> <p>---<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/gaming\/events\/227591867\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Class: Writing for Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Horror Game Worlds","id":"227591867","time":1457047800000,"updated":1457055835000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1235153267000,"name":"Playcrafting NYC Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1388429,"urlname":"gaming","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Playcrafters"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10001","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"153 East 53th Street","name":"Citigroup Center: lower level Atrium","lon":-73.97048,"id":701175,"state":"NY","lat":40.758217,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.17122232914,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1308862006000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is an opportunity to practice Japanese conversation, and discuss and study the grammar, particles, Kanji, and culture.

A study in contrasts from birth, they had been compatriots, colleagues, and even friends. But above all they were rivals. Matching each other\u2019s ambition and skill as lawyers in New York, they later battled for power along political fault lines that would not only decide the future of the United States, but define it.<br\/>A series of letters between Burr and Hamilton suggest the duel was fought over an unflattering comment made at a dinner party. But another letter, written by Hamilton the night before the event, provides critical insight into his true motivation. It was addressed to former Speaker of the House Theodore Sedgwick, a trusted friend of both men, and the author\u2019s own ancestor.<br\/>John Sedgwick suggests that Hamilton saw Burr not merely as a personal rival but as a threat to the nation. Burr would prove that fear justified after Hamilton\u2019s death when, haunted by the legacy of his longtime adversary, he embarked on an imperial scheme to break the Union apart.<br\/>John Sedgwick is a journalist, novelist, memoirist and biographer who has written or co-written numerous books ranging from his psychological thriller, The Dark House, to his multi-generational family memoir, In My Blood. He has also written many articles for GQ, the Atlantic, Newsweek, Vanity Fair, and other magazines<br\/>Thursday, March 3, 2016 - 6:30 PM<br\/>| Open to the Public | Members' Room<br\/>| $10 with advance registration, $15 at the door<br\/>[masked]<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Manhattan-Lectures-Conversations\/events\/228810428\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"John Sedgwick, War of Two: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, & the Duel Host: Mila","id":"228810428","time":1457047800000,"updated":1457558523000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367970596000,"name":"\"Manhattan Lectures & Conversations\"","group_lon":-74,"id":8392492,"urlname":"Manhattan-Lectures-Conversations","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Life-long Learners"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10065","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"3 E 64th St","name":"Consulate General of India","lon":-73.969986,"id":2393471,"state":"Ne","lat":40.76733,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.59397482872,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454951378000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The Consulate General of India, New York and the Art of Living Foundation are partnering to bring \u2018Meditation Happy Hour\u2019 to the community every other Thursday.

And find yourself opening more to your unconscious, Divine Consciousness and Spiritual awakening.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/1\/b\/4\/600_439073684.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Imagine releasing the mental and energetic blocks that disconnect you from yourself and from the divine in times of stress and crisis.<\/p> <p>Imagine feeling the energies inspire the words, and the words guide your energies.<\/p> <p>Imagine opening your awareness to encompass the dance between these elements each time going deeper, and deeper, places you weren\u2019t even aware of, helping you create more change, more release.<br\/>Imagine feeling\u00a0 new hope, new ideas re-energized.<\/p> <p>What to Expect: We create a safe and comfortable space, and take the time to answer any questions you might have. Typically, there are 2-3 rounds of guided meditation and Vortex Healing\u00ae combined. In each round, Simon and Joel work together. Joel guides the meditation with words, creating trance. And Simon channels the Vortex Healing\u00ae energies.<\/p> <p>Each round, words, energies and trance will blend together, taking deeper into mind, body, energy and soul to create more profound effects. Who is this class for? This class is for anyone who is curious about experiencing hypnosis, energy work and wants to make change in their life. What\u2019s required for this class? Just bring yourself, an openness to new experience and the possibility of change.<\/p> <p>=================================<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelelfman.com\/hypno-vortex-group-meditation.html\">For more go here<\/a> or try the links below to answer more questions:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelelfman.com\">Joel Elfman\u2019s website<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelelfman.com\/faq\/\">Hypnosis &amp; NLP FAQs<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\">Simon Deacon\u2019s website<\/a> and more info about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vortexhealing.org\">Vortex Healing<\/a><\/p> <p>=============================<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/hypnotic-vortex-healing-guided-meditation-tickets-18470648206\">CLICK HERE TO REGISTER<\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/hypnotic-vortex-healing-guided-meditation-tickets-18470648206\">$35-regular price<br\/><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/hypnotic-vortex-healing-guided-meditation-tickets-18470648206\">$30-early bird (available until 1 week before event)<\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/e\/7\/2\/600_445567794.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>=============================================================<\/p> <p>Come share this journey, and experience these 2 amazing modalities, hypnosis and Vortex Healing blending together to help your unique goals and needs.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you.

Whether you\u2019re seeking to move up in your organization, looking for a new job, thinking about making a career change, launching a new business, wanting to attract new clients, or looking to scale your social impact, in today\u2019s rapidly-changing, hyper competitive working world a strong and consistent personal brand is key to creating new opportunities for your career or business.<\/p> <p>The truth is we all have a personal brand. It is how we are perceived by others - our friends, colleagues, and the public. It is what people think about when they hear our name and what people say about when we are not in the room. The key question we need to ask is: do we take charge of our personal brand or do we leave it up to chance?<\/p> <p><b><i><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/PersonalBrandNov16\">Personal Branding with Purpose<\/a><\/i><\/b> is not about learning how to \"create\" a personal brand.

We'll be in the cafe. Look for our red Meetup sign. Please feel free to arrive late or leave early. It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll often have set topics, like gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.

Here's our synopsis:<br\/>Two things threaten Marais\u2019 dissertation on Virginia Woolf: her hot new girlfriend and her own dark past. Confronted by echoes of sexual trauma in Woolf\u2019s work, Marais races to write her own way into a happier future. She\u2019d give body and soul to claim a love greater than any she's known before. But after you learn to guard against life, can you open again? Trigger warning: brief descriptions of sexual violence.<\/p> <p>SKIN is a frank and funny collage on sex, danger, Virginia Woolf and the transformative power of art. Tickets on March 3 are just a suggested donation of $15, with a talkback and reception to follow, and proceeds will benefit the Fund for a Safer Columbia (FSC). The March 3 presentation of SKIN is actually being co-sponsored by Columbia Pride, as well.<\/p> <p><br\/>I imagine you may have heard about Emma Sulkowicz's inspiring Carry That Weight mattress project last year, and the student activism that sprang up around it. The FSC was founded when activists started running into costs that outpaced their personal finances (like when they delivered 28 mattresses to Columbia's president and were charged for their disposal).<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's the Facebook event page for the SKIN benefit, where you can learn more about the show: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/952631481484770\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/952631481484770\/<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Tickets can be reserved by emailing [masked]<\/p> <p>Thanks so much for any support!<br\/>I look forward to hearing from you soon!<\/p> <p>All our best,<br\/>the creative team of SKIN<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LGBT-History-and-Culture\/events\/229078853\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"SKIN-A Lesbian Play With Music on Sex, Danger, Virginia Woolf & the Power of Art","id":"229078853","time":1457051400000,"updated":1457093752000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1286895187000,"name":"LGBT History and Culture","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1720782,"urlname":"LGBT-History-and-Culture","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10710","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Yonkers","address_1":"78 Market St.","name":"L.L.

How does it work? And, what practical place does it have in day-to-day life?<\/p> <p>The purpose of this group is to answer these questions, as well as bring like-minded people together to form a network of support in living with clear intention. You'll learn about the Universal Laws and Abraham Hicks' processes and practices. This will help you shift your energetic vibration, align with your higher self and empower you to deliberately create a life you love.<\/p> <p>Coming together as a group to do this type of work is incredibly powerful.

We will be playing one of our favorite games, Hot Seats!\u00a0<\/p> <p>Hot Seats is a fun communication game where one person at a time can volunteer to have the attention the rest of the group placed on them for 1-2 minutes while they can be asked any question on any topic. You can chose to lie, tell the truth, or pass, but it's always encouraged to let your true self come out in a safe a fun environment.<\/p> <p>Whether you are someone who already OMs, you are curious and want to meet some of the OM community, or you just want to enjoy a warm and electric evening of connection, come join us!!<\/p> <p>Bring an item of food if you desire, and we will provide some extra food too!

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713544\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713544","time":1457132400000,"updated":1457137225000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07002","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bayonne","address_1":"Kennedy Blvd","name":"Jewish community center","lon":-74.110471,"id":767047,"state":"NJ","lat":40.68338,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":7.82562065125,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454546924000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/5\/e\/1\/600_447286561.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Social NJOP <b>Shabbat Across America<\/b> @ JCC<\/p> <p>Join three rabbis for Live music and\u00a0 Great Kosher Food\u00a0 catered by<\/p> <p><i><b>Lox, Stock &amp; Deli<\/b><\/i>\u00a0 - Munchmobile visits five Kosher delis, picks this as\u00a0 winner of<i> Best Deli in NJ!<\/i><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.com\/entertainment\/dining\/index.ssf\/2013\/08\/its_all_kosher_munchmobile_visits_five_kosher_delis_picks_a_winner_best.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.com\/entertainment\/dining\/index.ssf\/2013\/\/its_all_kosher_munchmobile_visits_five_kosher_delis_picks_a_winner_best.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.nj.com\/entertainment\/dining\/index.ssf\/2013\/\/its_all_kosher_munchmobile_visits_five_kosher_delis_picks_a_winner_best.html<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>and<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Mike Goldstein<\/b> - EZ Dating Coach, who will speaking briefly on relationships....<\/p> <p><br\/>Mike Goldstein helps clients through one-on-one coaching.\u00a0 He has been featured on the <b>Today Show, NJ.com, Patti Knows of Millionaire Matchmaker, and Shape Magazine<\/b>.\u00a0 <b>83%<\/b> of Mike's clients enter relationships during coaching and he currently has <b>100%<\/b> client satisfaction.\u00a0 To learn more about Mike please visit his &lt;a&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt; for specific, straight to the point dating advice.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nThis Friday night March 4 @ 2016\u00a0 starts at 6pm !!<\/p> <p><br\/>Location: JCC's Social Hall<\/p> <p>Easy Parking by JCC &amp; next to Bayonne Park across street.<\/p> <p>Cost: $10.00 p\/p\u00a0\u00a0 All Inclusive. \u00a0 Please call JCC[masked] to Guaranty Food reservation.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"@ JCC Social Hall","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hudson-County-Jewish\/events\/228594788\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":10800000,"name":"NJOP Shabbat Across America @ JCC","id":"228594788","time":1457132400000,"updated":1457289723000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449267344000,"name":"Hudson County Jewish Project","group_lon":-74.1200027466,"id":19182484,"urlname":"Hudson-County-Jewish","group_lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Humans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":7,"distance":12.7534132004,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453931168000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>**PLEASE READ ENTIRE DESCRIPTION FOR TICKET INFORMATION**<\/b><\/p> <p>Hi Everyone,<\/p> <p>At the suggestion of one of our members (Dee) please come join us for a Tricky Tray Fundraiser (this Tricky Tray is a fundraiser for JDRF tohelp find a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its complications through the support of research) at SS.

As entrepreneurs and professionals, it is imperative that we stay around like minded individuals. Relationships are the\u00a0catalyst for success.\u00a0<\/p> <p>2. In this\u00a0ever so growing competitive\u00a0job market, you will quickly learn that it is not always what you know, but who do you know.<\/p> <p>3. You never know what personal connection or business deal is hidden in a little conversation.\u00a0<\/p> <p>4. If you are seasoned, you can meet a young pup with\u00a0a lot\u00a0of pep to do heavy lifting for you.<\/p> <p>5. If you are new, you can meet an expert in your\u00a0field and skip a lot of mistakes just by listening to their experiences.\u00a0<\/p> <p>There are many advantages to networking. Here at the NJ Networking Circle we like to keep things fun and innovative. What better way is there to wind down a hard work week then with a little professional party and networking. We like to consider ourselves the transition group because we are not in an up tight work atmosphere, nor is it a full blown out night at the club. You can consider it to be either the cool down of a long week or the warm up to a great weekend; the choice is yours. We just want you to take a load off and have a great time meeting great people.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please RSVP the event and post comments or suggestions.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NJ-Entrepreneur-and-Professional-Networking-Circle\/events\/228621522\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"name":"NJ Networking Mixer","id":"228621522","time":1457132400000,"updated":1457144114000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1407589521000,"name":"NJ Entrepreneur and Professional Networking Circle","group_lon":-74.1299972534,"id":16280592,"urlname":"NJ-Entrepreneur-and-Professional-Networking-Circle","group_lat":40.8600006104,"who":"Pioneers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","phone":"212-665-9460","address_1":"215 E. 99th St.","name":"El Taller Latino Americano ","lon":-73.947456,"id":24023743,"state":"NY","lat":40.78698,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.3957760334,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447861838000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us at El Taller Latino Americano\/The Latin American Workshop for Spanish Conversation Meet-up!

Having reached Stresa they happen to meet Goffredo and Lavinia, a pair of siblings who live there: the former is about to embark in architectural studies, the second is suffering from a nervous disorder. Reviving a maternal instinct that has lain dormant within her for so many years, Alienor feels the need to stay by Lavinia\u2019s side to help her overcome her anxiety and suggests that her husband continue on his travels with Goffredo.

Critics Consensus: Earnest without being didactic and uplifting without stooping to sentimentality, Pride is a joyous crowd-pleaser that genuinely works.<\/p> <p>\"PRIDE is inspired by an extraordinary true story. It's the summer of 1984, Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers is on strike, prompting a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists to raise money to support the strikers' families. Initially rebuffed by the Union, the group identifies a tiny mining village in Wales and sets off to make their donation in person. As the strike drags on, the two groups discover that standing together makes for the strongest union of all. (C) CBS \"<\/p> <p>This film touches on the themes of income inequality by its focus on labor unions (one of the key factors promoting the economic strength of the middle class.) as well as the LGBTQ community.

Temptations, distractions and uneasy feelings often delay the development. Soul purification, the process to a transparent consciousness of Presence, is obtainable through regular soul exercises.

In this class we will examine reasons and remedies to assist one in spiritual advancement through a proven path to spirit.

Miller (Ven. Lobsang\u00a0Chodren) first encountered Tibetan Buddhism in the spring of 1987 during a course at Kopan\u00a0Monastery in Nepal. Since then, she has spent a great deal of time engaged in meditation retreats,\u00a0study, teaching, and Buddhist center management throughout the world. Ven. Amy has been\u00a0teaching extensively since 1992 and was ordained as a Buddhist nun in June 2000 by the great\u00a0Tibetan master, Ven. Choden Rinpoche. She has also directed several FPMT centers and projects for decades and has completed a seven-month solitary retreat.

The film inspires its audiences with a sense of purpose and possibility, and is bringing school communities together in re-imagining what our students and teachers are capable of doing. \u00a0After seeing this film, you\u2019ll never look at school the same way again.<\/p> <p><br\/>The current educational system in the United States was developed a century ago during the rise of the industrial age and was once the envy of the world. However, the world economy has since transformed profoundly, but the US education system has not. Schools are attempting to teach and test skills, when mastered, that still leave graduates woefully unprepared for the 21st Century. After presenting this problem, the documentary focuses on the story of a school in San Diego that is completely rethinking what the experience of going to school can look like. As we follow students, parents and teachers through a truly unorthodox school experience, the audience is inspired to consider what sort of educational environment is most likely to succeed for the 21st century?\u00a0<br\/>Featured in Film festivals in 2015 including Sundance, TriBeca, Seattle, Dallas...<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/mltsfilm.org\/\">\"I have not seen a clearer examination of the underlying assumptions about the real skills students need to succeed in today\u2019s world.\" \u00a0Jordan Ronson, NYC English teacher, The Bronx High School of Science<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>\"I<a href=\"http:\/\/mltsfilm.org\/\">ncredible!

How often do we get an opportunity to be real with each other in NYC?<\/p> <p>We play 3 communication game (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). Imagine meeting new people in an environment where people felt comfortable to be themselves. That's what we have created.<\/p> <p>It's a refreshing change from the typical networking or bar conversation.<\/p> <p>You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can have the life that you want.<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. In an hour and some you may even forget for a moment you are in New York City.<\/p> <p>OneTaste NYC is an organization teaches Orgasmic Meditation, otherwise known as OM. The games we play at TurnON are designed to create the visceral sensation of Orgasm\/OM in your body, without having to actually do the practice (or remove any clothing!).<\/p> <p>It's a friendly invitation to play and push your edges in a way that feels good. This allows you to stretch yourself and inspires self-discovery!<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:40p.

There are no \u201cliability waivers\u201d or other written agreements to sign. By signing up you agree not to hold anyone responsible if something goes wrong for any reason.<\/p> <p>The Group Leads. The Organizer Organizes.\u00a0<br\/>We do not have \"trip leaders.\" There is, however, always an organizer who gives out as much trip event information as possible and practicable on the website event post prior to an event. Nothing replaces the collective wisdom of the group, especially in the wilderness. We work hard to strengthen our post information and advice to ensure our trip groups are matched for our hikes and that everyone in the group is ready mentally or physically for the hike and that everyone has all relevant facts before the event. As a member you can do your part - read the post carefully prior to your attendance. If you have questions, suggestions or comments, email them to your organizer well beforehand.<\/p> <p>Hike Preparation\u00a0<br\/>You are solely responsible for researching each event and for selecting and bringing appropriate gear and supplies, including clothing, food and water, to each event. If you have any questions regarding appropriate gear or supplies, please contact the event organizer for the event. You understand that any guidance given by an organizer is done as a courtesy based on the organizer's personal experience and physical capabilities, which may not be the same as yours, and will not hold any organizer liable for guidance provided. You remain responsible for you.<\/p> <p>Leave No Trace:\u00a0<br\/>Outdoor skills and ethics - protect our hiking resources.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/lnt.org\/learn<\/a><\/a>...<\/p> <p>Children:\u00a0<br\/>Children are allowed on hikes or other events at the sole discretion of the event organizer as indicated in the event posting. You are solely responsible for all children under your care.<\/p> <p>Identification and Insurance:\u00a0<br\/>We strongly encourage all hikers to bring along identification, medical insurance card and emergency contact names and phone numbers.<\/p> <p>Pets:\u00a0<br\/>Domestic pets are allowed on hikes or other events at the sole discretion of the hike organizer as indicated in the hike posting. All pet owners must bring a leash along in case needed for the safety of all hikers, other pets, or your own pet. Pets must be leashed on the request of the event organizer. Pet owners are solely responsible for their pets and their actions. If you are afraid of dogs, and are attending a hike that permits dogs, please advise the hike organizer ASAP, so we can try to accommodate your needs.<\/p> <p>Event Updates:\u00a0<br\/>By signing up to an event, you agree to check the event posting often for any updates to the event.<\/p> <p>Waits at Trail Junctions:\u00a0<br\/>The group decides where and when to wait up for those behind - but no one joining us should always count on that. It's easy for trail junctions to be overlooked. By going with us, you agree to research the trip on your own, know where we are going and how to get back, even if for some unanticipated reason you may wind up having to do that by yourself.<\/p> <p>Hike Pace:\u00a0<br\/>There is no set pace - you set your own. HYOH - Hike Your Own Hike.<\/p> <p>Any hike over 10 miles will not be done as a large group hike, we will leave the parking area together but then split apart as our pace allows us to do so. All hikers are encouraged to hike at a pace they are comfortable with. Please make sure you know the route and can make it out alone if needed. If you have concerns please see the organizer before the hike starts. The organizer will wait at the end of the hike to make sure all hikers complete the hike safely.<\/p> <p>Attendance and Lateness Policy:\u00a0<br\/>Be on time. At the discretion of the organizer, we may wait 15 minutes only for late attendees that have already signed up for an event.<\/p> <p>Group Size:\u00a0<br\/>The group size will be determined based on the hike and the rules of the land we will be hiking on. Please update your 'YES'- or 'MAYBE' RSVP if your plans change so members on the waiting list can attend the hike.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Hammock-Backpacking-Group\/events\/227378321\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":102600000,"name":"Winter Backpacking on  Hunter Mountain","id":"227378321","time":1457184600000,"updated":1457375791000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1420817106000,"name":"The Hammock Backpacking Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18316342,"urlname":"The-Hammock-Backpacking-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Trail Junkies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Manhattan","address_1":"Broadway\/59th St-Columbus Circle","address_2":"Subway: A\/B\/C\/D\/1\/9","name":"Time Warner Atrium Entrance","lon":-73.981949,"id":1010048,"state":"NY","lat":40.767647,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.29250895977,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429482791000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>PLEASE NOTE: WE WILL MEET AT 8:30AM .\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Route: <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/view\/1001126511\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/view\/1001126511\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/view\/1001126511<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Reminder:<\/b> Please post your pace and expected distance when RSVPing.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/dashing-whippets\/events\/227584941\/","yes_rsvp_count":28,"name":"Manhattan Weekend Run","id":"fxbsplyvfbhb","time":1457184600000,"updated":1457197261000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1242098830000,"name":"Dashing Whippets Running Team","group_lon":-74,"id":1454408,"urlname":"dashing-whippets","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Dashing Whippets"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Mamaroneck","address_1":"154 E Boston Post Rd","name":"Push Fitness of Westchester, Inc.","lon":-73.731873,"id":23829497,"lat":40.949238,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.3136844635,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455742746000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Weekly, relaxed group 5k!

This will save us a lot of time on the field.<\/p> <p><b>RULES OF THE GAME:<\/b><\/p> <p>First and most important rule of the game is to have fun and enjoy the time on the field! Rough play and offensive language will absolutely not be tolerated!!! In plain words, no slide tackling, no pushing and no telling off.<\/p> <p>No power shots allowed. No power shots means; you can shoot the ball but not as hard as you can. This doesn't mean that you can not take the shot at all. Kicking the ball or taking the shot on the goal, is of course allowed.<\/p> <p>If you don't sign up for the game, do not show up.<\/p> <p>If you are late for the game, you must wait until the game in progress is over to join your team.<\/p> <p>Those that don't comply with these rules, will kindly be asked to leave the field so others can enjoy the game and maybe a two game ban.<\/p> <p>Any other questions regarding the rules of the game or anything else, should be directed to the organizer directly or to the assistant organizer\/s!!!<\/p> <p><b>Location:<\/b><\/p> <p>Riverside Park\u00a0at West\u00a0107 &amp; 108 Street<\/p> <p>Take the 1 RED Line Train to Cathedral Pkwy an walk two blocks down,\u00a0to 108th Street and Riverside Dr.<\/p> <p>The field is down the lower level near the river.

Thinking, on one hand, is an amazing tool we have for remembering, discerning, planning, goal-setting, strategizing, and problem solving. On the other hand we also know\u00a0thinking as a jumbled, wandering, repetitive, and rebellious storm of mental activity that is anything but helpful or useful.\u00a0We know the \"Monkey Mind.\"<\/p> <p>It sometimes seems that the goal of meditation must be to get rid of our thoughts, but that is not really the case. The goal is to expand our awareness and understanding of actual experience and develop our mental\u00a0skills so we can actually stay present and engaged and not be led astray by that monkey. Thoughts will always continue to come and go, but with practice they will not distract us.<\/p> <p>It is important to remember to bring compassion, kindness, gentleness and patience to our\u00a0work with the thinking minds and thoughts.\u00a0 A sense of humor doesn\u2019t hurt either. By remembering that everyone faces the same challenges of mind (it's not a\u00a0personal failing),\u00a0we all can realize a peaceful co-existence with those challenges - with practice.<\/p> <p><b>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation. There is time for discussion and Q&amp;A. \u00a0Please note that while there is benefit in participating in regular sittings and practice, you do not have to attend every class to find value.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Fee by donation<\/i><i>: Suggested starting donation is $10 and your generosity is greatly appreciated. \u00a0No one is ever turned away for lack of funds. \u00a0The donation box is on the sign-in table.<\/i><\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p>\n\n<b>Foundations of Mindfulness<\/b> Mindfulness is more than just paying attention. It is powered by intention, but we also have to get out of our own way to experience clearly what\u2019s actually appearing. We have to find an openness of heart and mind and suspend our judgements and theories and rationales so we can see more than what we always see. We have to begin to relinquish the \"I\" and \"mine\" kinds of ownership over what arises in our experience. We also have to unhook from the time line that may bind us to the past or project us to the future and be mindful now.<\/p> <p>Over the next few weeks we will explore of the traditional Foundations of Mindfulness.<\/p> <p>Introduction to Mindfulness<br\/>Mindfulness of the Breath<br\/>Mindfulness of the Body<br\/>Mindfulness of Emotions<br\/>Mindfulness of Thinking<br\/>Mindfulness of the Mind<br\/>Mindfulness in Daily Life<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meditation-and-Mindfulness-in-Bay-Ridge\/events\/228197754\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":4500000,"name":"Foundations of Mindfulness - Thinking","id":"qsqbplyvdbkc","time":1457193600000,"updated":1457214646000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1430952109000,"name":"Meditation and Mindfulness in Bay Ridge","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":18579743,"urlname":"Meditation-and-Mindfulness-in-Bay-Ridge","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11201","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn ","address_1":"Tillary St and Cadman Plaza W ","name":"Cadman Plaza (Turf Fields) ","lon":-73.99128,"id":15573482,"state":"NY","lat":40.696358,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":3.71463751793,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413340512000,"fee":{"amount":10,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a co-ed adult soccer lesson with Coach Moe.

After we finish our hike and make it back to where we began, we will get down into a local eatery to cool down, chat, relax, and regain our energy from our successful hike before we break off and say our farewells. No one is obligated to stay if they are scheduled to be somewhere else though ^^.<\/p> <p>Note that there is another meetup following later in the day at 7PM for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bronies-NYC\/events\/228109159\/\">Zootopia Movie Viewing<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Check over on event page for ticket details.<\/p> <p>Notice about necessary fare: For use, the NYC subway will cost $2.75 per ride.<\/p> <p>As a recommendation it is important to keep well hydrated.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713561\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713561","time":1457204400000,"updated":1457209016000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"97 Warren Street","name":"Outside of the entrance to Barnes and Noble","lon":-73.99958,"id":22642112,"state":"NY","lat":40.688686,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":5,"headcount":21,"distance":4.27475214005,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":48,"created":1455629956000,"fee":{"amount":2,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><b>PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY, ESPECIALLY THE BOLD TYPE.<\/b><\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you are registered for this walk and can't attend, please change your RSVP online from \"YES\" to \"NO\".\u00a0 THERE IS NO NEED TO POST WHY YOU CAN'T MAKE THE EVENT.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>HAVE EXTRA LAYERS OF CLOTHING.\u00a0PLEASE DRESS PROPERLY FOR THE WINTER CONDITIONS.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>I also scheduled this same walk on Sunday, March 6th.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a sociable walk along a very scenic route filled with interesting places.

Each month a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed and debated. This group, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Freemasons.<\/p> <p><b>Study Topic<\/b><br\/>March's topic will be conducted by Brother Anouk van Opstal on a study of Freemasonry: \"Symbols: philosophical and intellectual speculations or tools of daily life?\" After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.<\/p> <p>Whether we realize it or not, we are surrounded by symbols on our daily lives. But what are symbols? And more importantly are we still able to decipher them and what do they mean to us? Our society privileges the usage of the scientific method to explain our Universe and its working to us. Although it has assisted in the development of great discoveries and advances it is evident that it does not allow space for the imaginary and the symbolic. We are becoming more and more aware that our Universe, just like our lives, are more complex than science can explain. Is it possible to have another perspective and have a more complex thinking that allows for symbolic thinking? It is no secret that Freemasonry is based on rituals and symbols so what is its contribution in this regard?<\/p> <p><b>Directions:<\/b><br\/>[masked]th Ave Whitestone, NY 11357<\/p> <p><b>Mission Statement<\/b><br\/>The Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education. We further embrace the concept of a community environment, where ideas can be shared and debated in an open forum. From the seven liberal arts to the arcane, we seek to gain and to share the knowledge that is the legacy of mankind.<\/p> <p><b>More Resources<\/b><br\/>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.philosophicalsociety.org<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Facebook:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masonicphilosophicalsociety<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>Learn more about Freemasonry: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.co-masonry.org<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City\/events\/228096075\/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Symbols: philosophical and intellectual speculations or tools of daily life?","id":"228096075","time":1457208000000,"updated":1457302392000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1378747138000,"name":"Freemasonry for Men and Women in New York City","group_lon":-73.8099975586,"id":10179932,"urlname":"Freemasonry-for-Men-and-Women-in-New-York-City","group_lat":40.7799987793,"who":"Seekers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"241 West 30th Street, 2nd FL, A101 ","name":"Edgar Cayce Center","lon":-73.993797,"id":24268738,"state":"NY","lat":40.749275,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.205450728536,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451695904000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>ARE Center NYC<\/p> <p>Saturday March 5th, 3-5 pm<\/p> <p><br\/>Medical Intuition<\/p> <p><br\/>All Illnesses have a frequency and vibration to them. Similarly,\u00a0thoughts, emotions, events etc. also reflect a vibration. The energy\u00a0field of every living thing contains cellular memory embedded in the\u00a0core of its very existence. This cellular memory holds those patterns\u00a0in place until a shift occurs, whether conscious or not. Everything we\u00a0experience has a ripple effect as we are all interconnected.In this class we will learn about our own ailments through palpation\u00a0on an energetic level, and work on tracking their origins, their\u00a0projections, and their present state of manifestation. By doing so,\u00a0the shifts will become more conscious then unconscious, and we can\u00a0learn to be more in control of how to maintain balance when we are\u00a0struggling physically.

Organized in a rough chronological sequence beginning on the seventh floor, the presentation is divided into eleven thematic \u201cchapters.\u201d Each chapter takes its name not from a movement or style but from the title of a work that evokes the section\u2019s animating impulse. The exhibition elaborates some of the themes, ideas, beliefs, and passions that have galvanized American artists in their struggle to work within and against established conventions, often directly engaging their political and social contexts. Works of art across all mediums are displayed together, acknowledging the ways in which artists have engaged various modes of production and dissolved the boundaries between them.<\/p> <p>As a collection presentation, the works on view necessarily reflect the Whitney\u2019s record of acquisitions and exhibitions, which constitutes a kind of collective memory\u2014one that represents a range of individual, sometimes conflicting, attitudes toward what American art might be or mean or do at any given moment. Works that have rarely, if ever, been shown appear alongside beloved icons in an effort to unsettle assumptions about the American art canon. The presentation also underscores the difficulty of neatly defining the country\u2019s ethos and inhabitants, a challenge that lies at the heart of the Museum\u2019s commitment to and continually evolving understanding of American art.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Taken from the Whitney Museum's website.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/whitney.org\/Exhibitions\/FrankStella\"><a href=\"http:\/\/whitney.org\/Exhibitions\/TheWhitneysCollection\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/whitney.org\/Exhibitions\/TheWhitneysCollection<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/American-Sign-Language-League-of-Nassau\/events\/227683538\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":7200000,"name":"Whitney Signs:  The Whitney's Collection","id":"227683538","time":1457211600000,"updated":1457221017000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1399129219000,"name":"American Sign Language League of Nassau and Queens","group_lon":-73.6200027466,"id":14245302,"urlname":"American-Sign-Language-League-of-Nassau","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Signers' Delight"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10014","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"165 West 4th Street","name":"Four Faced Liar","lon":-74.001404,"id":3570062,"state":"NY","lat":40.732132,"repinned":false},"headcount":5,"distance":1.37416768074,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455655801000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Arrive at four, but we often start late.

Any skill level and any style is welcomed!<\/p> <p>Follow and join our facebook page for updates on the group, art relating to the theme, and more at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/ImaginativeIllustratorsNYC\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/ImaginativeIllustratorsNYC\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/ImaginativeIllustratorsNYC\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Imaginative-Illustrators-Of-NYC\/events\/229298889\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":12600000,"name":"Lets Draw Together!
