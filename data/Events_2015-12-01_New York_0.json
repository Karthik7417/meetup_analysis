By volunteering, you\u2019re agreeing to stand on your feet from 7:00 am- 4:00 pm and help pass out water to runners, clean up cups and do other volunteer-y sorts of tasks. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. It could be cold, wet or windy\u2026or all three.<\/p> <p>On the other hand, you get to be part of an amazing event which features runners from all over the world coming to NYC for the most well known race on the planet.<\/p> <p>There are also lots of good beer places nearby so afterwards, we could all probably use a beer.<\/p> <p>So, if you think you can commit, here\u2019s what you need to do:<\/p> <p>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/mynyrr.nyrr.org\/login\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/mynyrr.nyrr.org\/login<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n-If you are a NYRR member and have a login, log in.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME. \u00a0YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT. \u00a0NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP. \u00a0IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p>1) You can not add \u00a0guests to your RSVP. \u00a0Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group. \u00a0It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP. \u00a0There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go. \u00a0If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually. \u00a0YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub. \u00a0Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game. \u00a0Games will be to 2 scores. \u00a0If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to score and tie the game. \u00a0If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more\u00a0possession\u00a0to try to tie the game. \u00a0If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again. \u00a0For example:\u00a0If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p>6)\u00a0On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down. \u00a0For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years. \u00a0This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an\u00a0defensive\u00a0player. \u00a0This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p>8) Donations: \u00a0I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone. \u00a0All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc. \u00a0You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/226295210\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlytpbcb","time":1446386400000,"updated":1446398820000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":14,"distance":5.09583377838,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1370538278000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pickupsoccer-202\/events\/226200145\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"name":"GAME","id":"dnkzcgytpbcb","time":1446386400000,"updated":1447689963000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1214915969000,"name":"Bay Ridge FC Get back in shape pickup soccer","group_lon":-73.9599990845,"id":1206990,"urlname":"pickupsoccer-202","group_lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Pick-up Soccer Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":22,"headcount":8,"distance":9.24234104156,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1370538368000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Ridge-Futbol-Club-FC\/events\/226317129\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Game","id":"qqkzcgytpbcb","time":1446386400000,"updated":1447690054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1215363535000,"name":"Bay Ridge Futbol Club (FC)","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1213586,"urlname":"Bay-Ridge-Futbol-Club-FC","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Bay Ridge Futbol Club Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10606","country":"us","city":"White Plains","phone":"914-686-9000","address_1":"200 Central Ave","name":"City Limits Diner","lon":-73.780175,"id":999703,"state":"NY","lat":41.036492,"repinned":false},"headcount":3,"distance":22.6720314026,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446069530000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-vintage-motorcycles\/events\/226380524\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":97200000,"name":"Bikes and Breakfast - November","id":"226380524","time":1446386400000,"updated":1446507740000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340482106000,"name":"Westchester vintage motorcycles","group_lon":-73.8000030518,"id":4151322,"urlname":"Westchester-vintage-motorcycles","group_lat":40.9900016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10013","country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"West Street and North Moore","name":"Pier 25","lon":-74.012032,"id":1576885,"state":"NY","lat":40.720306,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":13,"headcount":0,"distance":2.35855054855,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445950312000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>This event is proudly brought to you by Soccer Beyond!<\/b><\/p> <p>Learn more on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/soccerbeyond.com\">SoccerBeyond.com<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond\">Facebook.com\/SoccerBeyond<\/a>.<\/p> <p><b>Details\u00a0-\u00a0<i>Fun, interactive, effective.<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>90min.

This fascia restriction can make one more prone to having injuries, abnormal posture, and inefficiency, as well as asymmetrical weakening. By targeting rotated key areas in weekly Yin Yang Yoga class, one can better release tension, move with ease, and benefit from improved posture and injury prevention. \u00a0In addition, increased respiratory control and focus have been reported by students.<\/p> <p><b>The Yin Yang Yoga for Runners <\/b>class begins with series of held Yin floor postures to open the meridian\/chakras pathways of the body. While surrendering into the edge of each pose for 2-5 minutes, students are guided in the cultivation of observance and breath, as they experience release of connective tissues and the stagnant energy around the hips, thighs, and lower back. Awareness is emphasized to sensations in the body that are grounding and powerful experience of the NOW. The Yang or moving practice allows students to integrate the newly released energy, joint spaces for circulation, and flexibility, into vigorous strengthening postures and movement sequences. Freedom of breath, alignment, and mental clarity will be elicited deeply during, after the class, and into one's training.<\/p> <p><i><b>After our INTRO CLASS ON 9\/10: <\/b>\"Jennifer is an awesome instructor.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/226321511\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Morningside Park","id":"gjrzflytpbcb","time":1446397200000,"updated":1446410309000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":3.18494486809,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445731739000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Announcement: As of today, I have and am still getting a lot of comments\/complaints regarding the details of this meet up.

We will first walk past the beautiful and unusual Armour-Stiner House. We'll\u00a0then view Villa Lewaro, a palatial white stucco red-tiled roof mansion with 34 rooms.\u00a0Later on, we'll be going to the Lyndhurst Estate. Overlooking the Hudson River, the 67-acre\u00a0Lyndhurst Estate (named after the Linden trees planted on the estate) has a\u00a0Gilded Age, Gothic-style mansion, huge carriage house, two-lane bowling alley, rose garden, and greenhouse.\u00a0The Lyndhurst Estate has more\u00a0grassy lawn space than\u00a0medium-sized parks in NYC (including Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Below is Lyndhurst's\u00a0romantic rose garden where we will have lunch.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/b\/d\/8\/600_438172184.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/2\/e\/c\/600_438013036.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We'll be having lunch at about 1:50 PM at the rose garden of the\u00a0picturesque Lyndhurst Estate. For lunchtime, bring a blanket or something to sit on the grass. There are not many benches or rocks to sit on around the estate. There also is no place to buy lunch at the Lyndhurst Estate. After we eat lunch, we'll explore the beautiful grounds of the Lyndhurst Estate.<\/p> <p><b>We don't have to pay to enter the grounds of the Lyndhurst Estate because there is no\u00a0admission fee for\u00a0those who walk in.<\/b> However,\u00a0those who drive into the estate\u00a0have to pay an admission fee of $5 per\u00a0person in the vehicle, but this fee does not apply on a weekday or in the winter months.<\/p> <p>Below is the Old Croton Aqueduct path with a ventilator. The Old Croton Aqueduct is an easy, leveled dirt path. We'll occasionally\u00a0be walking on the Old Croton Aqueduct, which will connect us to\u00a0historic mansions\/houses. But we'll mostly be walking on paved trails or sidewalks. In 1992, the Old Croton Aqueduct was awarded National Historic Landmark status.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/f\/3\/5\/600_437980757.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Bring lunch, sun protection, water, EXTRA LAYERS OF CLOTHING, and comfortable walking shoes. <\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is a sociable walk along a very scenic route filled with interesting places.

No sailing experience is required, but preference is given to experienced sailors since the trips can\u2019t happen without them.\u00a0 As space is limited on the boat, simply RSVP\u2019ing \u201cYes\u201d to an event does not guarantee a spot on the boat.\u00a0 If a spot is available, you will be contacted directly with event details.<\/p> <p>Sailors can take their first trip to get acquainted and enjoy the party.\u00a0 From then on, sailors can choose to (1) work the morning shift and help out with the launch or (2) work the evening shift and help out with the return.\u00a0 Generally, sailors spend less than a third of the trip working and can take the rest of the time to relax and socialize.<\/p> <p>The current crew is made up of young, educated Manhattan professionals. We are looking to meet new people who will enjoy the atmosphere and company of everyone on the boat.\u00a0<\/p> <p>If you and\/or your friends are interested, please copy, paste, and fill out the questionnaire below in an email and send to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a>.

Since we\u2019re meeting on Nov 1, Tamara thought it would be ideal to have a Samhain gathering that day. As many folks know, Samhain is the day when the veil between the worlds is not only its thinnest, but when it is actually lifted. It is a day when we honor our ancestors - both family and magical bloodlines, our loved ones and our pets who have crossed over. And because the veil is so thin, we take a lot of time to communicate with and divine with those who have crossed.<\/p> <p>Liz will be giving a brief talk on the history Samhain - as well as some of its modern day traditions. We are too large a group to perform a \u201cdumb supper,\u201d but Liz will describe it from the standpoint of a traditional Wiccan and will also share about mediumship and methods of communicating with the dead (Liz is mainly spiritualist trained, but have been a psychic medium since I was quite young). On Samhain, it is customary to dress up as goddesses, gods and the fae, because the fae are so intensely present during this point of the wheel of the year (the veil is at its thinnest both on Samhain and Beltaine - May 1). Feel free to dress up or just come as you are - witchy-ness and all. Liz will bring down her scrying tools (talking board, black mirror, crystal ball) and cards. Liz thinks it would be awesome to read each other for the New Year and to see what messages come through from the shide (pronounced SHEE uh - or SHEE - meaning the mound or burial mound). God and Goddess bless and see you everyone soon.

Also, we have extended this meeting time one more hour till 5pm because of the huge scope and details of Rebekah's research and to allow more time for a Q&amp;A, so the DNNY meeting will be running from 2pm to 5pm!<\/p> <p><b>Bio: <\/b><b>Rebekah Roth<\/b> enjoyed a nearly thirty year airline career working as both a flight attendant and an international purser. She was trained as an emergency medical technician and served as a volunteer firefighter.<\/p> <p>Her expertise and training as a flight attendant allowed her to research the events of September 11, 2001, with an insider\u2019s knowledge that eventually lead her to discover details and answers to some of the most haunting questions surrounding that infamous day in our history.<\/p> <p>Rebekah enjoyed a very exciting life both in the air and on the ground and because of that, was encouraged by co-workers to write a book. As she began to do that, she discovered that ten of the accused 9\/11 hijackers were still alive. Several of them were also airline employees employed with Saudi Arabia Airlines and that they had had their identifications stolen years prior to 9\/11. At least four of the accused hijackers threatened to sue the U.S. Government and the FBI if they did not stop using their names and identities.<\/p> <p>That discovery, along with the refusal by the U.S. government to discontinue their false accusations, ignited her curiosity. After thousands hours of research, using official government documents, print and video media from 9\/11, and several books, Rebekah discovered that there were also at least two women involved in the 9\/11 event. Using her personal knowledge of in-flight procedures, FAA hijacking protocols, the state of Massachusetts and cell phone technology, she discovered yet to be exposed details concerning the planes, the passengers and the perpetrators which are woven into \u201c<b>Methodical Illusion\u201d<\/b>.<\/p> <p>In the months following the release of Methodical Illusion, Rebekah had several people contact her with more information that had never been made public, so she decided to weave that new information into a sequel and the <b>\u201cMethodical Deception\u201d<\/b> was born.<\/p> <p>The novel format helps the reader to learn about the FAA protocols and behaviors that would be expected by the flight crews, along with other information about people and corporations Rebekah discovered were involved in the planning or execution and\/or the financial gain from the fourteen years of wars in the Islamic countries of the Middle East.<\/p> <p>Rebekah's mission in choosing to write these books was to help the person who had never investigated 9\/11 or had always had some doubt about the official story, to see the event through the eyes of an airline professional as her main character, very much like herself wakes up to the truth and discovers what happened to the planes, the passengers and crew members that unforgettable day in our history.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Format:<\/b> The meeting will be done on either Skype and will start promptly at 2pm so please be on time.

For a week, you'll be given daily readings and exercises to learn the basics of Stoicism and how to put it to practice in the modern world. They also test Stoicism's efficacy by administering validated psychometrics before and after Stoic Week to see if and how Stoic practice works.<\/p> <p><b>Stoic Week 2015 runs from November 2-8<\/b>. And, as we've done for the past couple of years, the NYC Stoics will have meetups bracketing Stoic Week to help give you extra support for your practice.<\/p> <p>This meetup is intended to help you sign up for Stoic Week if you haven't already (I'll try to bring a computer). We'll also cover the introductory material. Finally, we'll have plenty of time for open discussion to answer both basic and advanced questions about Stoicism.

Act I is set in British colonial Africa in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victorian_era\">Victorian era<\/a>, and Act II is set in a London park in 1979. However, between the acts only twenty-five years pass for the characters. Each actor plays one role in Act I and a different role in Act II - the characters who appear in both acts are played by different actors in the first and second. Act I parodies the conventional <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Comedy\">comedy<\/a> genre and satirizes Victorian society and colonialism. Act II shows what could happen when the restrictions of both the comic genre and Victorian ideology are loosened.<\/p> <p>The play uses controversial portrayals of sexuality and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obscene_language\">obscene language<\/a>, and establishes a parallel between colonial and sexual oppression.<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cloud_9_%28play%29#cite_note-oxford-2\">[2]<\/a> Its humour depends on incongruity and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carnivalesque\">carnivalesque<\/a>, and helps to convey Churchill's political message about accepting people who are different and not dominating them or forcing them into particular social roles.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"F train to 7th Avenue Stop.

There are at least four tournaments we compete in each year and practices will adjust in the weeks before the tournaments to prepare participating players.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Walk in.

Be aware Argo closes at 10pm.<br\/>If you're spending too much time THINKING about writing, come and join us for a session of focused writing. It may just be \"pipe-cleaning\" for now, but you'll feel better showing up at the page. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice.<\/p> <p>WHERE: Argo Tea Cafe, Columbus Circle Subway Station. 1792 Broadway.<\/p> <p>SOME TIPS:<\/p> <p>Argo has plenty of outlets - we will be on the back, large table.<br\/>Seats are hard to come by, and I can only save so many, so please, come on time! If you come late, we might have already started.<br\/>The music and occasionally nonmember conversation can be loud, so bring headphones too.<br\/>WiFi is available with purchase.<br\/>It's a little chilly, so if you get cold bring a sweater.<br\/>And it goes without saying that buying a cup of joe or a snack from Argo for being nice enough to host us will bring you good writing karma.<br\/>If you aren't sure you can make it, please don't RSVP!

When you RSVP you will be contacted for an approximate start time.\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>Be prepared to be interviewed like you are applying for a job, not a modeling position. I am not looking for one time models but models that want to work consistently; that are team players; can collaborate with other models and have traits to work independently.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>What I look for in the interview:<\/b> personality, personality, personality! It is imperative that applicants be naturally hospitable! Models must be honest, with a good sense of street smarts and have business sense; be a problem solver and resourceful; have a creative mind; and be a good communicator and responsible. ( RELIABLE with punctuality at the top of the list falls in line with being responsible).\u00a0<\/p> <p>Bring a resume if you have. I\u2019m looking for experience in any job or school. Have you ever volunteered for community service, helped organize events, played in a band, or do you have dancing experience, etc..?<\/p> <p><b>What to expect as a model in TheModels\u2019Den:<\/b><\/p> <p>If you think that getting paid $200 for 2-1\/2 hours is what it\u2019s about, Then this job is not for you. You are an independent model with TMD promoting you. You will only succeed if you put all your effort into the events. It means: taking the time to be creative, research and scout venues, contact studios, make reservations, post your events and be in constant contact with members to listen to their suggestions and see if you can produce an event they request.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This takes time and the photographers know it.\u00a0Take shortcuts and it can be clearly seen at the events. That is why I am actively involved with the planning process until the model develops a constant work flow.\u00a0<\/p> <p>In most cases for every hour an event is in length: it takes just a long to plan it and then some.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>STOP!<\/b> If you want to model only and not put the work into it the prep, you best not apply.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TMD offers models<\/b> the opportunity to choose their own hours, pay, location and the type of modeling they want to do. All in the environment they choose. They decide whether to use a hairstylist or use a make-up artist.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TMD offers photographers<\/b> the opportunity to attend an event that is not overcrowded but an event that is well managed with photographers limited to a specific amount ( typically 3) where only one photographer is shooting at one time.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Photographers are not required to provide pictures to models, saving the photographer countless of hours of editing. Editing only because they feel obligated to!<\/p> <p>TMD recognizes that events like these are the photographers safe haven where they can come and practice, experiment, try new techniques or new equipment without having to be committed to anyone. Beginners and pros come for that purpose.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>WHY FREE MODELING IS NOT GOOD For anyone<\/b>:\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>For the photographer -<\/b> Free model means trade for pictures. The problem is that time is money and editing pictures end up costing more money than paying a model.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>For the model - <\/b>waiting for a trade in most cases ends up being a disappointment. The photos are not what they expected and in many cases they just don\u2019t receive pictures.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>TRANSPARENCY is important at TMD<\/b> - we value everyones time! We find the best models that can model effectively that show up, are willing to accommodate reasonable requests that permit the photographer to try new approaches that allows the photographer to improve their skills.<\/p> <p>And sometimes the images just don't come out as expected!

The pilot study showed that detailed materials, paced appropriately with proper support, yielded positive results for teachers and students who had never written code before. TeachCode was developed to address the needs of business teachers or others who want to help children learn about code and STEM, but who do not have the skills in technology to develop age appropriate, differentiated curriculum and assessments.<\/p> <p>The TeachCode curriculum is created by educator, software test engineer, and TeachCode founder Dr. Jessica Ingrassellino. Jessica has taught the teach code curriculum in schools to students from sixth through twelfth grades, and she feels strongly that learning to code should be available to both teachers and students for low or no cost.\u00a0<\/p> <p>TeachCode seeks to bring the opportunity to learn code to people in the most underserved communities: people who are consumers of technology, but who might not get to create with or for that technology. Additionally, TeachCode seeks to bring communities together through partnerships between colleges, K-12 schools, and TeachCode, to create a supportive learning environment that inspires students, supports teachers, and encourages lifelong learning for all.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/vantagon.com\/\">Vantagon<\/a>\u00a0is a technology company focused in developing software solutions for collaboration and research.

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.<\/p> <p>Fifteen years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from Star Trek: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.<\/p> <p>Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it .<\/p> <p><br\/><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Editorial Reviews:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Station-Eleven-Emily-John-Mandel\/dp\/0804172447\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442677471&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=station+eleven\"><i>from Amazon.com<\/i><br\/><\/a><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b\/?node=390919011\">An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2014:<\/a> A flight from Russia lands in middle America, its passengers carrying a virus that explodes \u201clike a neutron bomb over the surface of the earth.\u201d In a blink, the world as we know it collapses. \u201cNo more ballgames played under floodlights,\u201d Emily St. John Mandel writes in this smart and sober homage to life\u2019s smaller pleasures, brutally erased by an apocalypse. \u201cNo more trains running under the surface of cities ... No more cities ... No more Internet ... No more avatars.\u201d Survivors become scavengers, roaming the ravaged landscape or clustering in pocket settlements, some of them welcoming, some dangerous. What\u2019s touching about the world of <i>Station Eleven<\/i> is its ode to what survived, in particular the music and plays performed for wasteland communities by a roving Shakespeare troupe, the Traveling Symphony, whose members form a wounded family of sorts. The story shifts deftly between the fraught post-apocalyptic world and, twenty years earlier, just before the apocalypse, the death of a famous actor, which has a rippling effect across the decades. It\u2019s heartbreaking to watch the troupe strive for more than mere survival. At once terrible and tender, dark and hopeful, <i>Station Eleven<\/i> is a tragically beautiful novel that both mourns and mocks the things we cherish. \u2013<i>Neal Thompson<\/i>\u00a0 --This text

Beyond Faith is for the person who doesn't quite fit in with\u00a0the pack, a person whose ideals and beliefs do not jive with their\u00a0peers, family members, or loved ones. This can be a tough journey,\u00a0especially for those whose family and friends are unsupportive of\u00a0their doubts and lack of belief. Our group aims to create a safe space\u00a0of support, community, inclusiveness, and encouragement on this\u00a0journey away from Christianity and towards a reason-based worldview.\u00a0For some, just the idea of entertaining serious doubts about faith can\u00a0be dangerous and overwhelming, and Beyond Faith seeks to ease the\u00a0process and create a warm, welcoming and optimistic environment for\u00a0like-minded folks on the same path.<\/p> <p><br\/>Beyond Faith is open to any young people who identify as atheist,\u00a0agnostic, Humanist, or who are having doubts about Christianity. We\u00a0are open to any and all denominations of Christianity.\u00a0Beyond Faith is\u00a0a safe space for women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who\u00a0are differently-abled. Because of this, the facilitators and\u00a0participants of this group will be expected to keep member identities,\u00a0meeting locations, and content confidential to protect everyone\u00a0involved.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure the confidentiality and safety of our group members, please email [masked] with the following questionnaire for the location details.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>New Member Questionnaire:<\/b><br\/>In an effort to ensure all members of this group are respectful and\u00a0open to others, we ask that you fill out this short questionnaire so\u00a0the organizers can tailor the group to its members.

We do this in an\u00a0effort to protect our members and ensure that our group is a safe\u00a0space for all attendees.<\/p> <p>This is NOT an application, all serious members will be invited regardless of answers to the questions below.<\/p> <p>1. Why are you interested in\u00a0Beyond Faith?<\/p> <p>2. Can you tell us a\u00a0little about yourself (including name\/age\/where you're from), and how\u00a0your experiences have brought you the point you're at now?

Do you define yourself as any\/all of the following: atheist,\u00a0agnostic, humanist, nontheist, or any other term?<\/p> <p>\n\n4. Where would you consider yourself on your journey out of Christianity and into atheism\/agnosticism\/nontheism\/etc?<\/p> <p>\u00a0<\/p> <p>Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

It can provide fundamental and often unseen insights that, once seen, create new and exciting opportunities. It provides a doorway into flow experiences and breathes life into sometimes vague spiritual concepts and ideas.<\/p> <p>Through Circling individuals can start to develop trust in a deeper intelligence in themselves and others. Part of what makes it special is that, although it is based on complex ideas, it is simple and empowering to take part in. We believe it to be one of the richest tools for human development in the world today because it works on so many levels.<\/p> <p>What is Circling?<\/p> <p>Circling is a practice where the attention of a small group is skillfully focused on an individual. This person gets to feel the impact of being supportively seen by others while also experiencing their honest in the moment feelings. The process revolves around connection, understanding and a deep authenticity between people. It involves bringing a greater awareness and appreciation into our connections with others and can be considered a relational meditation because of this. It is a paradigm-shifting practice that is supported by wide ranging research in how adults learn and develop.

This is the place to excavate what you truly desire. Have you wondered how to create the relationships you want? Experience the intimacy you crave? Where you can say the honest truth to your partner, your family, your lover and yet stay grounded in yourself?<\/p> <p>We believe that no matter what type of relationship you desire, human connection is at the basis of genuine relating. We play a set of intimate communication games that let you sharpen your relating skills and hone your attention. You get to shed off the layers that keep us from being seen, be vulnerable and feel more alive. We play 3 games (you can play at whatever level feels comfortable to you). It's a refreshing change from the typical \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d conversation. You get the opportunity to examine yourself. Through other people putting quality attention on you, asking questions with genuine curiosity, and then listening - really listening \u2013 to your responses.<\/p> <p>What comes up might surprise you!<\/p> <p>It's amazing how connected we can end up feeling - even in a room full of strangers - when we are willing to say what's real. At the end of the evening we will tell you all about how you can learn the practice of Orgasmic Meditation. What class you can take and what we have to offer so you can work towards having the intimacy you want.<\/p> <p>Come early, doors close at 8:10p.

ONLY 3% of businesses have a strategy to generate those referrals. Our BNI networking meetings are a proven word of mouth marketing referral generating strategy. Last year, members of BNI (Business Networking International) passed millions of referrals that generated billions of dollars of business for each other.

Jung<\/p> <p>Ever since the first tools were created over 3 million years ago, humans and their ancestors have been designing. Yet, throughout human history, the archetype of the designer has been activated through the few, while remaining embryonic and in potentia for the many. Change is in the air. At this moment, in our time, the archetype of the designer is being activated throughout the world, through anyone who chooses to relate to it.<\/p> <p>Let us then consider the following: What is the archetype of the designer? How is it shifting contemporarily? Why is it emerging so vigorously now?<\/p> <p>David Walczyk, EdD, is the founder of The Center for Design + Consciousness and is in training at the C.G. Jung Institute of New York. An award winning designer for over 20 years, he has also served as a Visiting Scholar at the United States Library of Congress, a Policy Fellow at the United States National Academy of Sciences, and was a co-author of the evaluation criteria for the Buckminster Fuller Challenge, named socially responsible design's highest award.

Play.<br\/>_____________________________________________________<\/p> <p>What will we be doing at the Meetup?<br\/>We will be meeting at the tennis courts for some friendly rallying, doubles, and singles play*. This meetup is open to players at any skill level; from beginner to advanced.<\/p> <p>*For those of you who are interested in singles play, please keep in mind that the ability to play singles predicates on the amount of members who have RSVPed as well as court availability at the meetup event's venue. We cannot guarantee singles play in every instance.<\/p> <p>How long will the meetup be?<br\/>The time listed for the meetup event is when you can expect to the event host to be there. If you would like to arrive earlier or later than the start time listed, please leave a comment in the meetup event you plan to attend. This will give everyone in attendance a good representation of who is showing up at what time.<\/p> <p>What will it be like?<br\/>Our group is very friendly and loosely organized to allow for a fun experience.<\/p> <p>Upon arrival, our event host will announce which court they are on in the comments of the meetup event. If you have a smartphone, we strongly suggest that you download the Meetup app for iPhone or Android to make communication easier.<\/p> <p>When you arrive at the courts, look for the event host listed or other members of the group playing on (or near) the courts listed. Use the photos of each host\/member on the website as a frame of reference.<\/p> <p><br\/>Introduce yourself. Let the host know your level of play and you will be assigned to a court immediately.<\/p> <p>Do members need to bring anything?<br\/>All members must bring their own racquet. Unfortunately, we do not supply racquets.<\/p> <p>All members are encouraged to bring a fresh can of new balls. You can always use a marker to mark your initials on your ball if you would like to keep them for future play. Please keep in mind that tennis balls only last a couple of days after taking them out of the can before they lose their bounce.<\/p> <p>If you plan to donate to the group, you can leave your donation with the meetup event host or the head organizer, Frank, if he\u2019s in attendance. All donations go towards the fees required to organize the meetup.<\/p> <p>Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?<br\/>Our meetup event is open to all players whether they're an absolute beginner or an advanced player. Players will be matched up with others based on their skill level. Beginners will be given an opportunity to play with higher level players so they can gain more experience with higher consistency.<\/p> <p>It is a high priority for our group to help beginners increase their skill and become better players. If you are reading this and are an absolute beginner, please don't be intimidated. We want you to join us and have fun.<\/p> <p>What should a newcomer expect?<br\/>If you're new to the group, you'll learn very quickly that our community is extremely friendly. We have a colorful cast of characters from all walks of life who are ready and willing to have a good time.<\/p> <p>Whether you're interested in easy-going rallying or competitive play, we can accommodate you.<\/p> <p>Questions?<br\/>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments; please send them to our head organizer, Frank Tirado via email.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bronxtennis\/events\/226428925\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":14400000,"name":"68 Degrees Is Perfect For Tuesday Night Tennis @ Crotona Park","id":"226428925","time":1446588000000,"updated":1446604236000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1335455062000,"name":"Bronx Tennis","group_lon":-73.8499984741,"id":3746792,"urlname":"bronxtennis","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Tennis Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07090","country":"us","city":"Westfield","address_1":"Lamberts Mill Road.","name":"Tamaques Park","lon":-74.32431,"id":21510052,"state":"NJ","lat":40.6286,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":19.4592037201,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446426566000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>SLB Boot Camp has taken a little break but is back up and running this week!

Security depends on timely updates and monitoring and even though the stakes for enterprise are high, the necessary maintenance is often overlooked, exposing you and your clients to security breaches. We\u2019ll discuss the context of Drupal security today, common mistakes and oversights when implementing Drupal, easy steps that enterprises can take today in order to reduce risks and give a demo of the Lumturio platform.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Bios:<\/b><\/p> <p>Murielle Marie Ungricht, CEO<\/p> <p>Belgium born co-founder Murielle Marie Ungricht is a successful and soulful entrepreneur, mentor, coach, writer and business strategist. She has a heart for women causes and women empowerment. Together with Sam, she has been running her own web agency for more than a decade. After finishing a philosophy major at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium she found her way in the corporate world, working as a web project manager for national and international companies.Her latest consultancy position was with the European Union.<\/p> <p><br\/>Sam Hermans, CTO<\/p> <p>Belgium born co-founder Sam Hermans is a successful entrepreneur, technical specialist and developer for one of the largest and fastest growing CMS platforms.

The European Commission handles over 300M page views per month.<\/p> <p><br\/>Lumturio is derived from the Esperanto word for Lighthouse.

Rather than doing a broad re:Invent recap as we sometimes have in the past, we will be joined by Richard Threlkeld, an Solutions Architect from Amazon, to present and demo the capabilities of their new services. Following the IoT talk we will hear from Simulmedia who has accumulated a significant amount\u00a0of\u00a0leanings\u00a0from the development of their\u00a0ETL pipelines and Redshift based Datawarehouse. If you are interested in the Big Data space, don't miss this opportunity to benefit from their experience. For more on the sessions see below:<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>AWS IoT Services<\/b><\/p> <p>We will have a brief overview of the AWS IoT service and a demo using industry hardware. This scenario will leverage the Shadow functionality of AWS IoT and invoke automated processes based upon the built-in rules engine. Additionally we'll also dive into some of the finer service details such as MQTT, Pub\/Sub architecture and security controls.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Building a Data Warehouse in AWS<\/b><\/p> <p>Hear from Simulmedia's Data Engineering team about how they built out their Data Warehouse using AWS services like Redshift, S3 and EC2. This will be a deep dive into the stack that supports one of the largest collections of TV viewing data in the world. In addition to this, the data team will also explain two of their guiding principles that have made their lives much easier - immutability in ETL pipelines and maintaining state within the Data Warehouse.<\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Logistics<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Food and beverages will be served.

Salted meats and preserved vegetables are also commonly used to enhance the dish. Sugar is an important ingredient in Shanghai cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Another characteristic is the use of a great variety of seafood. Rice is dominantly served over noodle or other wheat products.<br\/>Shanghai cuisine stresses on using condiments and keeping the original flavors of the materials and has features of being fresh, smooth and crispy. It aims at lightness in flavor, and beautifulness in decoration. The raw materials of Shanghai dishes are well cut, and the colors harmoniously arranged.<br\/>Now, special attention is being paid to low-sugar and low-fat food, a good quantity of vegetables and nutritional values.<br\/>Generally Shanghai cuisine is mellower and slightly sweet in taste. Sweet and sour is a typical Shanghai taste.<\/p> <p><b>MENU:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4?tab=menu<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FOOD GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Wu Xi Ribs<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/ngQ93gUmSLfrP2HWjAwG9Q\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Fried Pork Buns<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/svezeV3YmMnvNIct5Jl2Ew\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u2022 Braised Fish Belly<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-Gwk0JwyO2Pw\/Ta51jKqv08I\/AAAAAAAAAWk\/l3doIDd0jrE\/s1600\/5.P1011777+-+Copy.JPG\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-Gwk0JwyO2Pw\/Ta51jKqv08I\/AAAAAAAAAWk\/l3doIDd0jrE\/s1600\/5.P1011777+-+Copy.JPG<\/a><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Basil eggplant<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/6UghINfpUk-1nVznsJ5CIQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT GALLERY:<\/b><\/p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Dining Room<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/rLdqUVA1DnLqUTuICU3OkQ\/o.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>RESTAURANT REVIEW:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><b>DISCLAIMER:<\/b><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/pages\/Disclaimer<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>END<\/b><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Inside the Restaurant","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCAsianMeetup\/events\/226148508\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Dinner @ 21 Shanghai House (Shanghainese Cuisine)","id":"226148508","time":1446593400000,"updated":1446688166000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1421303761000,"name":"NYC Asian Meetup","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18338455,"urlname":"NYCAsianMeetup","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Asians"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"New York","address_1":"355 West Broadway","name":"littleBits Pop-Up Store","lon":-74.003052,"id":24159174,"state":"NY","lat":40.722866,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":100,"headcount":0,"distance":1.9996560812,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445220011000,"fee":{"amount":7.5,"accepts":"wepay","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Get Creative with IoT @ littleBits\u2122 with littleBits\u2122 Lab + More<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Learn about littleBits and get a chance to create cool creations at the new littleBits Pop-Up Store!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About littleBits<\/b><\/p> <p>littleBits\u2122\u00a0is on a mission to\u00a0Democratize Hardware\u00a0by empowering everyone to\u00a0Create Inventions, large and small, with a platform of easy-to-use\u00a0Electronic Building Blocks.

Here, your mind can come to rest and you can remember true peace. No experience with meditation is required, and everyone is welcome. We ask only that you make it your intention to sit still, quiet in body and mind, and to listen to; receive and follow my instruction to the best of your ability. You will learn to meditate as you practice. Please arrive for Meditation before 6:30 pm as we don't allow latecomers to enter.<\/p> <p>We at CRS are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing. We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in your life. Each week I will share with you a different inspirational message from Holy Spirit. This may take the form of creative visualization exercises, or instruction about the nature and purpose of meditation, or about our true nature and relationship to ourselves, to one another, and to the world. In a sense, this is both a meditation practice and a meditation class.<\/p> <p>Some students have been coming regularly for a number of years. Others drop in and out as they have time or need. Some come to learn and grow, others more so simply to calm down, to take time out from the frenetic pace of their busy lives. If you are new and feeling uncertain or shaky, do not hesitate to introduce yourself to some of the other students, to ask questions before or after. Try to observe and emulate the stillness and concentration of others around you whom you sense are most grounded. Soon, you, in turn, may provide inspiration and guidance for others.<\/p> <p>While the principles are based on ACIM, it does not matter if you are unfamiliar with ACIM or are not prepared to study it outside of this meditation. You can still take from this practice some very practical, effective lessons, tools, and experiences that can enable you to lead a more peaceful, purposeful, fulfilling and loving life.<\/p> <p>Namaste,<\/p> <p>Yasuko Kasaki,<br\/>Founder<br\/>CRS (Center for Remembering &amp; Sharing)<br\/>123 4th Ave, 2nd FL (between 12th &amp; 13th streets, above Think Coffee)<br\/>New York, NY 10003<br\/>[masked]<br\/>www.crsny.org<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ACIM-meditation\/events\/226369999\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","id":"qrgwjjytpbfb","time":1446593400000,"updated":1446606178000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1195080150000,"name":"ACIM-Based Guided Meditation","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":819043,"urlname":"ACIM-meditation","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"Meditators"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"distance":4.68076229095,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420483385000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Due to low number of turnout recently, I'm trying something new.

If he fails, he will die. The most recent suitor, the Prince of Persia, is to be executed at the moon\u2019s rising. Among the onlookers are the slave girl Li\u00f9, her aged master, and the young Cal\u00e0f, who recognizes the old man as his long lost father, Timur, vanquished King of Tartary. When Timur reveals that only Li\u00f9 has remained faithful to him, Cal\u00e0f asks why. She replies that once, long ago, Cal\u00e0f smiled at her. The mob cries for blood but greets the rising moon with a sudden fearful silence. When the Prince of Persia is led to his execution, the crowd calls upon the princess to spare him. Turandot appears, and with a contemptuous gesture orders that the execution proceed. As the victim\u2019s death cry is heard from the distance, Cal\u00e0f, transfixed by the beauty of the unattainable princess, strides to the gong that announces a new suitor. Suddenly Turandot\u2019s three ministers, Ping, Pang, and Pong, appear to discourage him. Timur and the tearful Li\u00f9 also beg him not to risk his life (\u201cSignore, ascolta!\u201d). Cal\u00e0f tries to comfort her (\u201cNon piangere, Li\u00f9\u201d) but then strikes the gong and calls Turandot\u2019s name.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/9\/600_434702057.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Act II\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p><br\/>Inside the palace, Ping, Pang, and Pong lament Turandot\u2019s bloody reign, praying that love will conquer her heart and restore peace. The three let their thoughts wander to their peaceful country homes (Trio: \u201cHo una casa nell\u2019Honan\u201d), but the noise of the people gathering to hear Turandot question the new challenger calls them back to reality.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/1\/f\/600_434702079.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The old emperor asks Cal\u00e0f to reconsider, but he will not be dissuaded. Turandot enters and describes how her beautiful ancestor, Princess Lou-Ling, was abducted and killed by a conquering prince. In revenge, she has turned against men and determined that none shall ever possess her (\u201cIn questa reggia\u201d). Facing Cal\u00e0f, she poses her first question: What is born each night and dies each dawn? \u201cHope,\u201d Cal\u00e0f answers, correctly. Turandot continues: What flickers red and warm like a flame, yet is not a flame? \u201cBlood,\u201d Cal\u00e0f replies after a moment\u2019s thought. Shaken, Turandot delivers the third riddle: What is like ice but burns? Tense silence prevails until Cal\u00e0f triumphantly cries, \u201cTurandot!\u201d The crowd erupts in joy, and the princess vainly begs her father not to give her to the stranger. Hoping to win her love, Cal\u00e0f offers Turandot a challenge of his own: if she can learn his name by dawn, he will forfeit his life.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/7\/600_434702167.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><i>Act III\u00a0<\/i><\/p> <p>In the Imperial Gardens, Cal\u00e0f hears a proclamation: on pain of death no one in Peking shall sleep until Turandot learns the stranger\u2019s name. Cal\u00e0f is certain of his victory (\u201cNessun dorma!\u201d), but Ping, Pang, and Pong try to bribe him to leave the city. As the fearful mob threatens him to learn his name, soldiers drag in Li\u00f9 and Timur. Cal\u00e0f tries to convince the crowd that neither of them knows his secret. When Turandot appears, commanding Timur to speak, Li\u00f9 replies that she alone knows the stranger\u2019s identity and will never reveal it. She is tortured but remains silent. Impressed by such fortitude, Turandot asks Li\u00f9\u2019s secret. It is love, she replies. When the soldiers intensify the torture, Li\u00f9 tells Turandot that she, too, will know the joys of love (\u201cTu, che di gel sei cinta\u201d). Then she snatches a dagger and kills herself. The crowd forms a funeral procession and the body is taken away. Turandot remains alone to confront Cal\u00e0f, who impetuously kisses her (Duet: \u201cPrincipessa di morte!\u201d). Knowing emotion for the first time, Turandot weeps (\u201cDel primo pianto\u201d). Cal\u00e0f, now sure of winning her, reveals his identity.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/9\/600_434702089.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Once again before the emperor\u2019s throne, Turandot declares she knows the stranger\u2019s name: it is Love.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/e\/b\/600_434631435.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Tickets<\/b><\/p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metopera.org\">metopera.org<\/a>.\u00a0 Click on calendar.\u00a0 Select November 3's date.\u00a0 Select the Turandot evening performance.\u00a0 Then, select your seat of choice.<b>\u00a0<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>Meeting Details<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>7:00 pm We will meet in the lobby, in front of the gift shop. \u00a0It is located on the right side of the ticket office.\u00a0<\/b><\/i>I will send out my cell phone number via group email the night before the event.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/9\/3\/c\/600_434631516.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We will also meet at intermission on the lower level (parking level) lounge for drinks or tea.

As a member of the Skverers, one of the most insular Hasidic sects in the US, he knows little about the outside world\u2014only that it is to be shunned. His marriage at eighteen is arranged and several children soon follow. Deen\u2019s first transgression\u2014turning on the radio\u2014is small, but his curiosity leads him to the library, and later the Internet. Soon he begins a feverish inquiry into the tenets of his religious beliefs, until, several years later, his faith unravels entirely.<\/p> <p>Now a heretic, he fears being discovered and ostracized from the only world he knows. His relationship with his family at stake, he is forced into a life of deception, and begins a long struggle to hold on to those he loves most: his five children. In All Who Go Do Not Return, Deen bravely traces his harrowing loss of faith, while offering an illuminating look at a highly secretive world.<\/p> <p>Event followed by dessert reception<\/p> <p>About The Author: Shulem Deen is the founding editor of Unpious, an online journal for voices on the Hasidic fringe. His work has appeared in The New Republic, Salon, Tablet Magazine, The Jewish Daily Forward, and elsewhere. He serves as a board member at Footsteps, a New York City-based organization that offers assistance and support to those who have left the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.

a piece that for you evokes the essence of a particular Enneagram type (whatever type you choose).\u00a0 Ideally, you will know the actual type of a principal creator of your piece (presumably, this will be the same type evoked), but if this isn't possible, just focus on the human qualities the a given piece of music evokes for you.<\/p> <p>You shouldn't tell the group what type you have in mind - we'll just play the pieces contributed, and have a group discussion about how they strike all of us.<\/p> <p>Of course, if you can't think of a piece to contribute, you are still welcome to attend, but if as many people as possible pitch in, it would help make for an interesting meeting.\u00a0 There is no \"right answer\" - we're just looking for an example of a piece that means something human to you, in a type-identifiable way.\u00a0 If you can think of many examples, consider picking a historically-important piece of music - one that's likely to mean something to others in the group.<\/p> <p><i>Please pick a short piece of music <\/i>- say, around three minutes - or, if you are drawn to longer pieces - try to identify a 2-3 minute important segment we can excerpt.\u00a0 You can identify more than one piece if you like -we'll arrange as time allows.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Advance Submission Requested<\/b><\/p> <p>Given that we might receive a pretty wide variety of types\/genres, I think it would be helpful to arrange the contributed pieces thematically, rather than jumping all over the place - i.e., from classical, to rock'n'roll, to hip-hop (or, whatever) and back again.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, if you could please email me with one (or perhaps two or three) pieces at least a bit ahead of the meeting - say <i>by Monday, November 2, at noon<\/i> - that would be a great help towards preparing something easier and more interesting to listen to than a random jumble.<\/p> <p>You can email me by clicking the \"contact\" button below my picture under \"Organizer\" at left toward the top of the pages associated with our group.\u00a0 A pop-up window should appear.<\/p> <p>(There is no need to tell me what type of you have in mind, either.\u00a0 We'll get to that part later.)<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Media for Submitted Pieces<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Last time, we played music using several media - some CD's I prepared, YouTube videos, and pieces on one member's mobile device.\u00a0 I think the YouTube video medium probably worked best.\u00a0 It's a practical way to find a great variety of music (for those not familiar, you can find many, many pieces there).\u00a0 Also, the visuals add something to the group-listening experience - obviously, this is most significant for a singer-songwriter performing his\/her own music.\u00a0 But even for a long-dead classical composer, listening while watching an expressive soloist, group, or conductor can open up a another dimension.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, please <i>email me a YouTube link <\/i>(or two or three), if you can.\u00a0 You can copy and paste the link from another widow in your browser to the Meetup pop-up message-window.\u00a0 If you can't find the piece you want on YouTube, try bringing a CD - or your own device, if nothing else works.\u00a0 I will again have the large tablet-device I used last time, so we can all watch and listen together.<\/p> <p><br\/>Looking forward to see you,<\/p> <p>Nicholas<\/p> <p>(Group Organizer)<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPS - note on schedule - last time, I spoke of possibly moving our monthly meetings to first Mondays -\u00a0 this may still happen, but not until early next year at the earliest.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/enneagram-4\/events\/225743432\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Music Series (pt 2) -

After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" \u2014\u00a0<i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.
