I invite you to come to a local dining and other related event to break bread n' at with fellow foodies and gourmets. Discover new restaurants, enjoy delicious meals, listen to live entertainment and make satisfying conversation with friendly dinner companions. <em>This group is intended for singles and couples AGE 21 AND OVER.<\/em><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Facebook Group:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=18155435619\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><br>\n\n www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=18155435619<\/span><\/a><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Future Questions:<\/strong> If you ever have any questions about a specific event, please contact the event's HOST, listed in the event details under \"SELECTED BY\" or at the top of the RSVP list under \"EVENT HOST.\" Click on the person's name, which is a LINK to his\/her profile page. From that page, click \"Send Email\" to send that person your question. I am the main organizer for the group, but I can't answer questions about someone else's event. I have a wonderful team of event organizers who do a great job of planning a wide variety of dining and other events.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>RSVP Etiquette:\u00a0 Please honor your RSVP!<\/strong> Our event planners do a lot of work to organize events. Please treat the group with the same respect you would show your own family and friends. If you RSVP \"YES\" and later find you can't attend, please change your RSVP to \"NO\" ASAP. If something comes up at the last minute, please call the event planner (if he\/she has given a phone number) or call the restaurant or venue. Someone there can give your message to the event planner.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>FYI:<\/strong> It is not necessary to RSVP \"No\" for events you can't attend. This is ONLY needed when you change from a \"Yes\" RSVP to a \"No\" RSVP.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Wanted:\u00a0 Event Planners!<\/strong> I am always looking for new people to become Event Organizers for Dining N' At. If you are interested in planning events, please read my guidelines here:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-dining-nat\/messages\/boards\/thread\/28322002\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-dining-nat\/messages\/boards\/thread\/28322002<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>After reading the guidelines, if you are still interested, please send me an email with your phone number and the best time to reach you. I will call and discuss the duties of this volunteer position, as well as answer any questions you may have. It's fun and very rewarding, but there are some responsibilities involved. (Most of it is common sense, like making reservations at restaurants, asking in advance if they will write separate checks, etc.) My email is:\u00a0 dnalansky AT yahoo.com. You can also email me from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-dining-nat\/members\/3473332\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">my Meetup profile page<\/span><\/a>.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Wanted:\u00a0 Event Suggestions!<\/strong> If you have a great idea for a future Dining N' At event, please send me an email and share your thoughts. I'm always looking for new and interesting restaurants to dine in, and places to explore in the Pittsburgh area. You can also start a new post on the Dining N' At Message Board to solicit opinions and get feedback from our members:\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-dining-nat\/messages\/boards\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburgh-dining-nat\/messages\/boards\/<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Philosophy:<\/strong> It is my personal philosophy to avoid CHAIN RESTAURANTS like the plague, so you will not find any of my events taking place in that type of establishment. However, my assistant organizers are free to choose any location that suits them. I prefer to support small \"Mom &amp; Pop\" type local businesses here in the Pittsburgh area. The food is usually better, if not outstanding! Small, one-of-a-kind restaurants offer a unique experience that can't be duplicated IMHO.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>My Faves:<\/strong> Some new personal favorites of mine are Tin Front Cafe in Homestead near the Waterfront, Pan Alma Latin Kitchen in Regent Square, and Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park. I will occasionally go to a \"small chain\" restaurant, such as Mad Mex, or Emiliano's because they started in Pittsburgh, and still base their operations here...and their food is REALLY DELICIOUS!<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Thank you for your interest in Dining N' At. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, thoughts or suggestions for the group. I look forward to meeting you at future events.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Best regards,<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Deena Alansky, Main Organizer<br>\n\n Pittsburgh Dining N' At Meetup Group<\/p>","lon":-79.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/6\/highres_15887670.jpeg","photo_id":15887670,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/6\/600_15887670.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/a\/3\/6\/thumb_15887670.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":3473332,"name":"Deena","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/6\/6\/highres_256014374.jpeg","photo_id":256014374,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/6\/6\/member_256014374.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/4\/6\/6\/thumb_256014374.jpeg"}},"members":2819,"name":"Pittsburgh Dining N' At","id":504822,"state":"PA","urlname":"pittsburgh-dining-nat","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Hungry Diners"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1179688578000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"republican","name":"Republican Party","id":95},{"urlkey":"libertarian","name":"Libertarian","id":99},{"urlkey":"constitutionparty","name":"Constitution Party","id":9850},{"urlkey":"ron-paul","name":"Ron Paul","id":21458}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RonPaul2012PGH\/","rating":4.57,"description":"<p>This group exists to help organize the local level grassroots effort to support the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign.<\/p>\n<p>We will also endeavor to educate all people who seek knowledge about freedom, the Constitution, The Campaign for Liberty, Austrian economics, and\u00a0all liberty based issues.<\/p>","lon":-79.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/3\/2\/highres_94296402.jpeg","photo_id":94296402,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/3\/2\/600_94296402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/3\/2\/thumb_94296402.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":4312723,"name":"DaveP","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/3\/7\/highres_3129527.jpeg","photo_id":3129527,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/3\/7\/member_3129527.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/5\/3\/7\/thumb_3129527.jpeg"}},"members":296,"name":"Ron Paul for President 2012 - Pittsburgh","id":506522,"state":"PA","urlname":"RonPaul2012PGH","category":{"name":"movements\/politics","id":13,"shortname":"government-politics"},"lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Patriots"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1179772522000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"movies","name":"Watching Movies","id":1201},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pgh-Chick-Lit-Book-Club\/","rating":4.82,"description":"Listen up Fashionistas!

This group was started by Kellie to help women, who have not been here their whole lives, connect with other women.<\/p>\n<p>To join our group, we do ask for a few basics:<\/p>\n<p>1) You need a profile picture so that we can recognize you. Our organizers can sometimes find you quicker than you can find them in crowded places. Walking up to strangers and asking if they are there for a meetup gets you some funny looks (been there, done that).<br>\n\n 2) Please answer the profile questions so people can learn about the folks they are coming out to meet. People can send messages before and after they meet you. Sometimes it\u2019s fun to find a new member from your home country, state, or town.<br>\n\n 3) You have to agree to not SPAM the group in any way, shape, or form.<br>\n\n 4) We do everything possible to foster an open environment, and request that all members give everyone \u201cconsideration\u201d.\u00a0 Anyone making members feel uncomfortable will be\u00a0removed from\u00a0the group.<br>\n\n 5) Our group is as good as the people and the activities.\u00a0If you see someplace you'd like to\u00a0try out, add it to the message board and we can make a meetup of it. If you are interested in becoming an event organizer, please let me know. We welcome additional interest in organizing events.<\/p>\n<p>6) If you have not logged onto the group in\u00a0approximately 6\u00a0months or longer, we will remove you from the group.\u00a0 If you find this has happened, just resubmit a request to\u00a0join\u00a0and you can be added again.<\/p>\n<p>7) We\u00a0will charge\u00a0yearly $5 dues to be a part of this group. Many people don't realize that the organizer pays from their own funds to keep the site going. The dues will help cover costs of the meetup website. If we wind up with a surplus we will announce an event and the group will cover some or all\u00a0of the costs for all who attend.<\/p>\n<p>8) Out of respect to our organizers, we do ask that you change your RSVP\u00a0if you have to back out of an event. It is ideal if you can update 24 hours ahead, but if not, please contact the organizer (most will give their cell phone number to attendees, in case of changes).\u00a0 We will enforce a 3 no-show rule.\u00a0If you don't update your RSVP and\/or don't notify the event organizer prior to an event on 3 occasions, and \"no-show\", I will remove you from the group.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, just get out there and join us.\u00a0 Meetup face to face.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to come to every meetup or even a majority, but I hope to see you out there at some point.\u00a0 We\u00a0look forward to meeting you all and making new connections!!<br>\n\n All the Best,<br>\n\n Kristen<\/p>","lon":-79.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/9\/highres_441334793.jpeg","photo_id":441334793,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/9\/600_441334793.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/7\/e\/9\/thumb_441334793.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13964400,"name":"Kristen Priestley","photo":{"photo_id":11988263,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/c\/8\/7\/member_11988263.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/c\/8\/7\/thumb_11988263.jpeg"}},"members":73,"name":"The Non-Native Pittsburgher Women's Social Meetup","id":1024065,"state":"PA","urlname":"Non-NativePittWomen","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1203817985000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"beararms","name":"Right to Bear Arms","id":716},{"urlkey":"usconstitution","name":"United States Constitution","id":10503},{"urlkey":"ron-paul","name":"Ron Paul","id":21458}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/ronpaul-1834\/","rating":4.47,"description":"<p>\"Truth is treason in the empire of lies...

Occasionally we will have speakers, classes, field trips, open rituals, fundraisers, mixers, awesome picnics, just to name a few things. We also hold an annual Witches Ball &amp; Samhain Celebration with Ritual &amp; Spiral Dance. No one in the Pittsburgh area can hold a candle to our event. We give you top entertainment, food, beverages, and it will be held in the city of Pittsburgh. We ask for a dollar a month in dues or $12 dollars annually. Most of our events are free, or for a small offering, other than the discounted ticket for the Witches Ball if you are a member.

You may also belong to LinkedIn, or Facebook, you probably are also tweeting.  But are you really getting what your want or need from those organizations?  If not, read on...\r\n\r\nThese forums are all serve a purpose, but wouldn't it be better to have an opportunity to join forces with a small group of business owners that have complementary skills and are willing and able to promote you.\r\n\r\nThis is an exclusive group of carefully selected business service providers that complement each other and are willing and able to build strong \"business building\" relationships with the other group members.  \r\n\r\nMembership in this group is not taken lightly; there are business and personal requirements that are highly recommended to be eligible for membership.  In addition, this group will be limited to 8 members in the following industries.\r\n\r\n-- Accounting Professional (CPA)\r\n-- Lawyer \/ Attorney\r\n-- QuickBooks Solution Provider\r\n-- Marketing professional\r\n-- Computer Services \/ IT Professional\r\n-- Website Development Professional\r\n-- Employee \/ Human Resource Benefits Professional\r\n-- Management Consultant Professional\r\n\r\nEssentially, this group will provide a network of business services that are essential to all small and mid-market businesses that do not have internal business services at their finger tips.\r\n\r\nWhat we are not:  We are not a group that meets once in a while and hopes to meet someone that we can get business from.  Our efforts will go beyond that.  Our goals will be to really help the other members of the group to prosper by building strong mature relationships with one another, and by combining our marketing efforts and promoting additional services; we will strengthen our network and essentially provide a one stop shop for small and mid-market businesses.\r\n\r\nWe do not take membership lightly and to ensure that our network is top notch, there are a number of qualifications listed below.  Please read this list carefully before deciding if you should apply to be a member.  \r\n\r\nThere will be a monthly 1-2 hour meeting that all members are expected to attend.  \r\n\r\nYou should plan to host meetings (preferably at your office) so that we can get to know each other well.  If you do not have an office, alternative arrangements can be made.\r\n\r\nYou should belong to at least 1 Chamber of Commerce (we will attempt to reach out to all of the larger chambers through our marketing efforts.) and you should actively participate in at least one additional networking group of your choice.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to provide at least 5 business references\r\n\r\nOwn your own business because your ability to add referral pages to your website, provide printed marketing material, and provide complimentary workshops cannot be inhibited by a parent company or franchise.\r\n\r\nYou should be in business for at least 3 years on a full time basis.\r\n\r\nYour educational \/ background should be related to the field your are working in now.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing to promote other businesses (you will know these businesses well, and will feel comfortable doing so.)\r\n\r\nYour business should not compete in any way with another business on the list.  For example, an attorney that prepares income tax returns need not apply, because our group will provide CPA services.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing and able to add a \"references\" page to your website, with Bios and Photos of the group members.  You should also have a professional photo and a bio available to share with the members for posting.\r\n\r\nYou should treat all clients and referrals received through this group with respect and show integrity as you work with them.  And never degrade another business in the group.\r\n\r\nYou must be willing to provide a free \"workshop\", \"clinic\", \"seminar\", or other type of promotional event that will be marketed to each of the other member\u2019s clients or contacts.  This is one way where we will be able \"show our stuff\" so to speak and pick up new clients by providing valuable and relevant information to potential clients.  It will take some effort to market these events; however the results will be worth it.  Think about it...You'll have 7 people that are able to reach out to 25 contacts to let them know you are offering a free clinic.  It keeps them in touch with past clients too.\r\n\r\nYou have read this far, so we know you are interested.  And you know that this is a working group, not a networking group.  There will be efforts required on your part to make this work.  If you have the time to invest in the work and the ability to take on new clients, the desire to build strong relationships with folks that are in a similar situation to your own, can see the benefits of joining forces with others to increase your profitability, then you should apply today.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no fee to join; however, we may from time to time, collect modest fees for items such as printing, mailings, etc.","lon":-79.9499969482,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":3539976,"name":"Susan Ansell","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/6\/a\/highres_6797258.jpeg","photo_id":6797258,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/6\/a\/member_6797258.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/3\/6\/a\/thumb_6797258.jpeg"}},"members":1,"name":"Pgh Biz Services Network","id":1513174,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pgh-Biz-Service-Network","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Service Providers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1252253514000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"photoshop","name":"Photoshop","id":186},{"urlkey":"digcam","name":"Digital Photography","id":206},{"urlkey":"photo","name":"Photography","id":223},{"urlkey":"photography-classes","name":"Photography Classes","id":15043},{"urlkey":"group-photo-shoots","name":"Group Photo Shoots","id":15731},{"urlkey":"travel-photography","name":"Travel Photography","id":16207},{"urlkey":"nature-photography","name":"Nature Photography","id":16600},{"urlkey":"portrait-photography","name":"Portrait Photography","id":16613},{"urlkey":"safari","name":"Safari","id":19063},{"urlkey":"studio-photography","name":"Studio Photography","id":19646},{"urlkey":"landscape-photography","name":"Landscape Photography","id":22268},{"urlkey":"amateur-photography","name":"Amateur Photography","id":24533},{"urlkey":"street-photography","name":"Street Photography","id":49954},{"urlkey":"photo-walks","name":"Photo Walks","id":59343},{"urlkey":"photo-enhancement-photoshop-programme-needed","name":"Photo enhancement (Photoshop Programme needed)","id":1314252}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/pittsburghphotomeetup\/","rating":4.63,"description":"<p>This group is all about photography.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have online events and in-person events which include photo walks in the Pittsburgh area or driving trips to interesting venues.

Its purpose is to bring healing transformative energies into the world. It couldn\u2019t be simpler. Our group comes together and sounds The Great Invocation \u2013 a prayer given to the world in 1945 which essentially says \"let light and love and power restore the plan on earth\". As we recite this mantra, automatically through the law of invocation\/evocation, high-vibrational, spiritual energies begin to flow through the group then out into the world stepped down to a lower level so that the energies are more usable to more. It is a real service to perform and if you do so, your own life will be transformed. Why? Because you cannot open yourself to these spiritual energies and have them flow through you without having yourself blessed. We do it primarily for service, but Transmission Meditation has this wonderful secondary effect on the people who participate. If you believe in a spiritual world and that energies condition all life, Transmission Meditation is a wonderful complimentary practice. We\u2019re told hour for hour there is nothing better we could do for the world. So if you\u2019re looking for a way to serve, a way to help, please consider Transmission Meditation as a way. <\/p>\n<p>There are three Transmission Meditation groups in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; The main group meets Mondays at 7:00 pm (6:45 intro) at Friend\u2019s Meeting House located at 4836 Ellsworth Avenue in Oakland.

Support is offered through our daily activities, as well as through our message boards. We currently have over 100 moms in our club. Some of our mothers work part time or during the school year, but the majority stay at home full time. Therefore, our activities are typically during the weekday. We offer at least one activity a day ranging from playgroups and park playtimes to lunch bunches, mocha mornings, and field trips. Our moms participate as much or as little as their schedule allows. On our message boards moms dialog about everything from how to get your child to give up their binky to what to do when your toilet explodes!<\/p>\n<p>Socialization for our members develops from our daytime activities with children and our evening activities with just moms. We offer a monthly Moms Night Out, as well as several activity groups including the following clubs: Book, Health &amp; Fitness, Knitting, Movie, Scrapbooking, and Wine. We also have occasional events for moms and their significant others, as well as family events like picnics.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our mission of service is fulfilled by supporting our local community through service projects, monetary donations, and sponsorship in events. Service projects include things like making Halloween and Valentine crafts for senior citizens, a collection drive for the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter, and making cards for Veterans. We support organizations that help women and children, as well as causes that are important to our members. We also sponsor a team each year in Pittsburgh's March of Dimes Walk.<\/p>\n<p>The Mt. Lebanon Moms Network is a great way to meet people if you are new to the area, new to motherhood, or new to staying at home full time. We offer activities and support for mothers in and around the Mt. Lebanon, PA area (i.e. Upper St. Clair, Castle Shannon, Dormont, Scott Township, Carnegie, Bridgeville). We do not have any geographic restrictions, however, potential members should understand that the vast majority of our events are in the Mt. Lebanon area. If you are willing to travel to events in this area, you can join our group, regardless of where you live.<\/p>\n<p>We are not your typical Meetup group, but a registered non-profit organization that uses Meetup for their website. If you are interested in joining our group, please click Join Us! on our Meetup site. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">You will then be prompted to create a Meetup profile that will be sent to our organizers.<\/span> Our Membership Director will be in touch with you\u00a0within a week\u00a0with details about how to join. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">All potential members are required to attend one of our monthly business meetings or another public event that accommodates your schedule prior to being approved to join our group<\/span>. This is done to ensure the safety of our moms and our children. At this event you can find out more about our group and meet other members.

This group is for seekers who are looking to enhance their spiritual lives with discussions and information drawn from ancient and modern Paganism on the Italian Peninsula. This is a place for sharing (rituals, recipes, spells, prayers, family traditions, art work, inspirational stories \u2026), asking questions, and discussing issues. This group is also a way for Pagan Italo-philes to meet and build community. I ask only that the focus of the conversation be Italy. There are other groups dedicated to Wicca, Witchcraft, and Paganism. Above all things this is a place to show love and respect for others ... other paths, people, and perspectives. As Italy's history is one of cultural diversity, there was never one right way to anything. Keeping that in mind, we need to recognize the diversity of those who share our love of Italy and its Pagan past. So if Nonna used to have saints on her altar, it is fine to talk about that here. One needs to remember that one way Pagan traditions survived was by disguising it as Catholicism. It is a legitimate part of our Italian heritage. I know this was the case for my family\u2026 I will be posting links to other groups, websites, articles on Stregheria, Stregoneria, Traditional Italian Witchcraft, ancient mythology (Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and Lombard), Folk Traditions of Italian-American immigrants, Paganism as it exists today in modern Italy. Some of the links will be in English and others in Italian (I will write a quick translation in English). I will be posting summaries of books I have read on Witchcraft. These will cover books written in Italian and in English. For books that are available here, in the USA, I encourage discussions based on these books or any others that you might be reading. The point of this group is to keep the conversation focused on Italian Paganism, as practiced there and as practiced abroad by those who are drawn to its rich history. This is a place to forge new friendships and stretch the mind a bit ... both good things! Simply put ... anger and harmful words will not be tolerated.

We will each bring in a few brews and everyone will get samples until the bottles are empty. We don't want to bring standard beers that anyone can get everywhere. The idea is to bring in beers that are a little more unique: new releases, seasonal, special editions, one-offs, rare to Pittsburgh brews, home brews or even beers that you pick up out of the area... that sort of thing.\u00a0 This isn't meant as an exchange group as we will be drinking the brews at the\u00a0meetups.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There are basically two sides to what could be brought to the meetups. The first would be beers that you would be able to buy in the area but are a little uncommon. Those would be the seasonal, new releases, special releases, etc. It is possible that many people would not normally get a chance to try these brews either because they sell out or because people do not realize that these are available. Once we get a chance to try these beers we might be able to go out to find them and buy them for ourselves. This is nice because if you try something that you like, you can keep an eye out and get more.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The other side would be beers that we would not be able to buy in the area. Those would be home brews and beers brought in from out of the area. Home brews are obviously not available anywhere except at the brewer\u2019s house. When I travel I like to stop in at bottleshops to see what they have available. I often find beers that I have never seen before and that I know are not available in Pittsburgh. This is nice because you would be able to try or share brews that we might never see again, a unique experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We will be able to try each brew and discuss what we like or do not like about it. People\u00a0who know a lot about beer will be able to share insight that others might not know and help educate those new to craft beers. People\u00a0who are just getting into craft beers will be able to taste different styles. They will be able to hear what other like minded folk think about each and compare that to their own opinions.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Outside of not wanting commonly available brew brought in, we are NOT going to be a snob minded group. People of all levels of experience and all levels of taste are welcome. The only way to get the Pittsburgh beer scene to grow is to have new people learn about craft beers. The only way to learn about beer is to try a variety.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>If you like it, drink it!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>New Group Rules:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring some unique, unusual or rare (for the area) beer for everyone to try.\u00a0 Just 2 bottles of 12oz brews, or 1 of larger bottles.<\/li>\n<li>Have a good time.<\/li>\n<li>Repeat rules 1 and 2 at the next Strange Brew...<\/li>\n<\/ul>","lon":-79.9700012207,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/e\/2\/highres_133943522.jpeg","photo_id":133943522,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/e\/2\/600_133943522.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/b\/e\/2\/thumb_133943522.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":9981649,"name":"Jim","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/9\/highres_10885209.jpeg","photo_id":10885209,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/9\/member_10885209.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/2\/7\/9\/thumb_10885209.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"Strange Brew","id":3394792,"state":"PA","urlname":"Strange-Brew","category":{"name":"food\/drink","id":10,"shortname":"food-drink"},"lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"members","city":"Canonsburg","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1331177473000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"sahm","name":"Stay-at-Home Moms","id":1348},{"urlkey":"wahm","name":"Work at Home Moms","id":4082},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"workingmoms","name":"Working Moms","id":10555},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"work-from-home-mothers","name":"Work From Home Mothers","id":22934},{"urlkey":"moms-night-out","name":"Mom's Night Out","id":23946},{"urlkey":"preschoolers","name":"Preschoolers","id":30878},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/More4moms\/","rating":4.95,"description":"<p><strong>Welcome to More4Moms! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Connect \u2026 Relate \u2026 Rejuvenate with other Moms! <br> <br> <\/span> <span><span>Canonsburg\/McMurray More4Moms invites all mothers to attend our monthly Topic Night \/ Discussion Meetings.<\/span> These gatherings are a great chance for you to learn something new, to bond with other moms, or to just take a break for a few hours.

If you have been using a point and shoot camera for years and decided to get yourself a SLR camera you may be confused by all the controls you suddenly have. Don't continue to use pre-programmed settings on your camera. Learn what the F-Stop, Shutter speed and ISO settings mean and learn how your photos can be much more creative than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I have been shooting for almost 30 years. I have shot studio, weddings, seniors, sports (including the Steelers and Pirates). My wife, friends, and neighbor kids come to me to help them understand how to use a SLR. I discovered many people have been upgrading to SLRs now that they are under $700 for excellent camera kits. So I thought I would see if others would be interested in learning about using there cameras to the fullest extent.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So if you are excited about your new camera but confused about its capabilities and want to just get out and have fun and learn a little, this group is for you. The groups meetings will stay small so you will get individual attention. I will try to mix up locations and types of shoots so that new things can always be learned.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>***** Important Information for New Members ******<\/p>\n<p>In order to really go into detail about how to use F-Stop, Shutter Speed, ISO, and White Balance and how to shoot in all manual mode I need to keep the group down to just four people. \u00a0This allows for plenty of questions and hands on assistance, any more and its difficult to give you the attention that you initially need. \u00a0Also, in order to attend lager group meet ups you will need to attend at least one of the Photo 101 meet up events. \u00a0The Photo 101 is about 2 hours. \u00a0The cost of Photo 101 is $50 (because of time and small group with individual attention). \u00a0Also the fee is required to be paid upon reservation via pay pal. \u00a0If you cancel 24 hours in advance I can transfer the payment to a future Photo 101 course. \u00a0After you attend Photo 101 you might be interested in Photo 102 which goes into greater depth about white balance, using a gray card and how to make basic fixes in Raw Convertor and Photoshop.

Sounds too difficult? It is more simple than you would\u00a0 imagine. It is all about letting of what really does not matter...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome proves to be remarkably applicable to modern lives. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, one can avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility will be presented along with how to put these techniques to work in our own life. You will learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control. Stoic philosophers show us how to become thoughtful observers of their own life in a way that parallels the mindfulness techniques of Buddhism. This is an western path to reduce suffering, live a virtuous life (in the Roman sense) and attain a truly joyful life.<\/p>\n<p>I will use William Irvine's <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy<\/em> as a starting point for conversation because it is so accessible to newcomers to Stoicism. We will then read other texts (ancient and modern) to build on this modern guide and introduction. Many of these texts can be found online at no cost to you. I will present a short lecture at the beginning of each meeting based on recent readings I have been doing. This mini-lecture is meant to stimulate conversation and active participation by attendees.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n There is a sister group on Facebook called Pittsburgh Stoics Group https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/127844464042850\/<\/p>\n<p>On the Facebook page I will post links, articles, and book recommendations on Stoicism and other ancient philosophies that can be applied to modern living.\u00a0 I hope that we can also have some insightful discussions there as well.

Biophilia is expressed all over the world every day, through complex collaborations such as the design and construction of buildings and landscapes; and intimate, personal encounters including nature hikes and home gardening.<\/p>\n<p><b>What Will We Do?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It all starts with good conversation!

Over delicious small-plates and light refreshments, a discipline or behavior will be identified \u2014 often by an expert guest speaker \u2014 and discussed among the participants in the interest of sharing ideas and identifying opportunities. With your direction, we hope to expand the schedule to include off-site trips to biophilic regional destinations like nature preserves, green buildings, and urban gardens, and to plan and enact initiatives in our own community to make things better for people and the planet.

There is a rotating group leader and it is their task to ask to assure that no question is leading or having an agenda of any kind. No one is trying to solve problems for anyone else. We attend the group to support each other\u2019s self inquiry. For many people this format is challenging and takes several meetings to learn, but it is a format that we have found to be successful and useful over the course of many years. If you are genuinely interested in the topic of Philosophical Self Inquiry, with an ultimate goal of self enlightenment please join us.<\/p>","lon":-79.9499969482,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":10352549,"name":"Philip Garrow","photo":{"photo_id":140921252,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/2\/4\/member_140921252.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/1\/2\/4\/thumb_140921252.jpeg"}},"members":23,"name":"Philosophical Self-Inquiry Discussion Group","id":9879342,"state":"PA","urlname":"Philosophical-Self-Inquiry-Discussion","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.4399986267,"who":"Self Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1377063391000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"nightlife","name":"Nightlife","id":4392},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"cocktails","name":"Cocktails","id":10475},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"happy-hours","name":"Happy Hour","id":16800},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"pittsburgh-area","name":"Pittsburgh area","id":18879},{"urlkey":"30s-and-40s","name":"30s and 40s","id":19133},{"urlkey":"pubs-bars","name":"Pubs and Bars","id":19195},{"urlkey":"singles-20s-30s","name":"Singles 20's  & 30's","id":23012}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/412-Social-After-Hours\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p><strong>412 SOCIAL\/Pittsburgh Happy Hour: WHERE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE MEET, MINGLE AND SOCIALIZE AFTER-WORK, HAPPY HOUR &amp; AFTER DARK!&nbsp; Since we're a merging of several groups everyone is allowed in, just having fun! <br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Group is the merging of 5 Internet Party Groups:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/412-Social-After-Hours\/\"><strong>412 Social<\/strong><\/a> (This MEETUP GROUP!)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/202051093172763\/\"><strong>Pittsburgh Fine Drinking Society<\/strong><\/a> (Facebook)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/PubCrawlIntPgh\/\"><strong>Pub Crawl International - Pittsburgh<\/strong><\/a> (Facebook)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Social-Club\/\"><strong>The Pittsburgh Social Club<\/strong><\/a> (Meetup)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pittsburgh Happy Hour<\/strong> (Private Group)<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is a group where people can meet, mingle, and socialize in pressure-free upscale environments.

There is a minimum food purchase requirement to keep the room. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please keep in mind that this Meet-up is not a \"networking\" group or a place or \"opportunity to market a\/your business\".

We typically are not talking about the Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley games from your youth, when there were only a relative few games out there. Today's boardgames come in different themes, sizes, durations, components, and objectives. They come from all over the world, too. Our group plays just about all the kinds you may find. Some examples of the types of games we often play are...<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Party games like:&nbsp;Codenames, Spyfall, Camel Up, and&nbsp;Dixit.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Euro style games like:&nbsp;Five Tribes, Orleans, Puerto Rico,Viticulture,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lords of Waterdeep.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Abstract games like:&nbsp;Qwirkle, Blokus,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hive.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Card games like:&nbsp;Dominion, Glory to Rome, Diamonds,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Munchkin<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Dice games like&nbsp;Pickomino, Qwixx, and&nbsp;Roll for the Galaxy&nbsp;<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Cooperative games like:&nbsp;Pandemic, Forbidden Desert, and&nbsp;Shadows Over Camelot.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Family games Like:&nbsp;Carcassonne, Catan, Istanbul, Splendor, Lanterns, and&nbsp;Machi Koro.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>American Thematic\/Ameritrash games like:&nbsp;Blood Rage, Arkham Horror,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bootleggers<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>So our members certainly have diverse tastes in games. And they are diverse people. We welcome folks from all walks of life, and we host the young and the middle aged, as well as some of the older folks, but all seem to have a great time when we get together! If you have kids, bring them if you plan on keeping an eye on them. Kids, adults, as long as everyone behaves, we are glad to see all of you!<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>Our organizers try to be very accommodating to new players. We try to pick and teach games that might be appropriate to your skill level, and that we think you might enjoy. Our goal is to get you enthusiastic about the hobby. We know not everyone loves every game, but I bet we can find at least one game for anyone. We have plenty of games. What we need to make is more gamers.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>If there is a game that you would like to try out, just RSVP to one of our meetup events and suggest it down in the comments for that event. Chances are that one of us has it in our collection, and we can bring it out with us.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The spaces we utilize tend to have tables that would not be very satisfying to someone who wants to play a Miniatures Game or a Roleplaying Game. We know folks that are for sure interested in playing them; we often just don't have the space. We do have Discussion Forums that can be a place for you to arrange a spot and time to get some of those games played.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>There is often no admission to attend our events in public places. We just hope you support the businesses that allow us to use their facilities with your patronage.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>RSVPs are very appreciated, and allow us to know to not cancel an event. It is not a big deal if you need to change your RSVP later on, and do drop in last minute if that's how life is working out for you. It just really only takes one person other than the host to say they are certainly in. Hosts would hate to sit there alone with two bags of games like a dope, wouldn't they?<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>If you have ideas for venues and towns in which to hold an event, please do contact Our Co-organizer or Organizer.

This is a mixed terrain ride including paved street, loose gravel, and technical mountain bike single track sections in the woods. We will ride on the streets until we reach Schenley Park. Once in the park we will ride along the main gravel trail, exploring the shorter single track sections until we arrive at Panther Hollow Pond.

people use Computer Aided Design, CAD, software for product design and various forms of manufacture, specifically using AutoCAD, the industry standard CAD package. \u00a0Over time, AutoCAD has been extended to provide 3D Modeling capability, but this functionality is limited because the software was originally developed to be an extension of 2D drafting.<\/p>\n<p>Starting from the ground up, the makers of AutoCAD have developed AutoDesk Inventor, a 3D modeling software package specifically designed to meet the needs of 3D Computer Aided Manufacture, or CAM. \u00a0The basis of Inventor is that it uses parametric modeling, a powerful design innovation that allows parts to defined by their dimensions instead of dimensioned after the design process is complete. \u00a0The use of parametric modeling in AutoDesk Inventor is similar to another software package, Solidworks.<\/p>\n<p>However, the challenge of using a tool as powerful as AutoDesk Inventor is that because it uses a new design paradigm, it can be challenging to learn. \u00a0To facilitate training in the many features of Inventor, representatives from AutoDesk and members of TechShop have started this Meetup here in Pittsburgh PA. \u00a0Our goal is to bring together members of the design community to form a study group to learn this powerful software.<\/p>\n<p>The structure of the study group is to work through an Inventor training manual covering one topic per week as described in the syllabus. \u00a0For members of this group, portions of the study guide will be posted in advance of each meeting. \u00a0There will be no fixed lecturer, instead members of the group are encouraged to sign up to speak on the weekly topic, and every member is encouraged to share their expertise. \u00a0We will meet in the computer classroom at TechShop at Bakery Square, one of the premier makerspaces nationally, now with nine locations across the country.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you

Packer Collection).<\/p>\n<p>Apologetics is about analyzing and defending what Christians believe, why they believe it, and asking whether or not Christianity is true and makes logical sense. Its okay to ask the tough questions, all is fair game.<\/p>\n<p>Every evangelist should be an apologist. The evangelist shares the gospel with people, and the apologist tries to convince people that the gospel is true and real. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Apologetics is as old as the Bible and ancient Greek philosophers. The word itself was made famous in the book of&nbsp; 1 Peter. \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and <i>be<\/i> ready always to <i>give<\/i> an <b>apologia<\/b> to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear\"&nbsp; <br> <\/p>\n<p>Apologetics is about taking an honest look at Christianity and asking, \"Is this stuff real?\", \"Did Jesus really exist?\", \"Is there any historic, logical, philosophic, and scientific merit to Christianity?\" Its Christianity for the deep and thinking person. Its Christianity for the skeptic and agnostic. In the end, the skeptic may, or may not, become a believer, that is their choice. But at least the facts are clearly analyzed and presented.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this 2 minute video for an excellent explanation. <br> <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RAFlmuiA-eE\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RAFlmuiA-eE<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b> <br> <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What will this meetup group do and accomplish?<\/b> <br> <\/p>\n<p>This group is for discussion and debate about religion and Christianity, and also a book club for apologetics authors such as: Ravi Zacharias, JP Moreland, Alister McGrath, John Lennox, Os Guinness, William Lane Craig, Phil Fernandez, CS Lewis, and anyone from the Veritas forum, or any other apologetics author\/speaker people are interested in. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Books by skeptics and atheists will also be read in order to give an honest analysis to their claims and to compare to the claims of apologists.<\/p>\n<p>We will also try and attend debates and Q\/A forums at Universities all over the country. Sadly most of these are not in Pittsburgh. Watch this video for an example of such a Q\/A session. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M8XSa79sU0M\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M8XSa79sU0M<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Basically we watch a difficult video or read a difficult book that challenges Christianity, and we try our best to refute it using apologetics books and materials, logic, common sense, and most importantly the Bible. We talk, a lot. Its mostly about discussion. If you want to listen, thats fine too. <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>Who should join this group?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in the Historic Jesus and Historic Christianity, philosophy, religion in general, or you are a Christian who is either struggling with their faith, or is strong in their faith but wants a deep and serious philosophic discussion about Christianity. Also if you are a believer in another religion or faith, or agnostic, or atheist, and would like to discuss Christianity or religion in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Christians, people of non-Christian faiths, skeptics, and atheists are all welcome!!! <br> <\/p>\n<p><b>When and where do we meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We meet in the Squirrel Hill library community room.

We usually have some assignment to complete before each meeting, such as watch a video, read part of a book, read an article, etc. During the meetings we discuss the assignment, watch videos, have formal debates between theists and atheists, and just talk about the subject of the assignment.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p> <br> <\/p>","lon":-79.9199981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/1\/highres_433778289.jpeg","photo_id":433778289,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/1\/600_433778289.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/5\/9\/1\/thumb_433778289.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":191682325,"name":"Christian Paul Arnold","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/2\/highres_256608658.jpeg","photo_id":256608658,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/2\/member_256608658.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/b\/e\/1\/2\/thumb_256608658.jpeg"}},"members":218,"name":"Pittsburgh Christian Apologetics Group","id":16204522,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Christian-Apologetics-Group","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.4300003052,"who":"Apologists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1407330037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"webdesign","name":"Web Design","id":659},{"urlkey":"wordpress","name":"WordPress","id":8304},{"urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology","id":10209},{"urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development","id":15582},{"urlkey":"mobile-development","name":"Mobile Development","id":21441},{"urlkey":"beginner-web-developer","name":"Beginner Web Developer","id":37019},{"urlkey":"wordpress-plugins","name":"Wordpress Plugins","id":61800},{"urlkey":"wordpress-themes","name":"Wordpress Themes","id":61801},{"urlkey":"wordpress-users","name":"WordPress Users","id":92030},{"urlkey":"wordpress-small-business-web-sites","name":"WordPress Small Business Web Sites","id":107053},{"urlkey":"wordpress-for-business","name":"WordPress for Business","id":128880},{"urlkey":"wordpress-seo","name":"WordPress SEO","id":133766},{"urlkey":"wordpress-developers","name":"WordPress Developers","id":198141},{"urlkey":"wordpress-websites","name":"WordPress Websites","id":307341}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-WordPress-Developers-Designers\/","rating":4.93,"description":"Pittsburgh WordPress developers, designers, and general users who want to ask questions, share tips, and be inspired.

The monthly assembly is our flagship event for celebrating together and nurturing a wider secular community. The idea started in London in January of last year with Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans, two stand-up comedians that decided they wanted the best parts of church\/synagogue\/mosque\/faith-community \u201cwithout the god bit\u201d. They put the idea out to their community and got such an overwhelmingly positive response that the thing went a little bit viral, with 30 assemblies popping up worldwide practically overnight. Since then the thing has gone way viral, with about 80 new assemblies working to launch in September. \u201cWell doesn\u2019t my city already have a dozen secular groups and a few Unitarian churches?\u201d I hear you asking yourselves? Yes, and thank goodness for that. We love these groups. We are not in competition with traditional secular organizations but instead hope to complement, energize and enliven them. The intellectual and cerebral aspect of our average secular groups is very important and indispensable, but it doesn\u2019t often leverage the positive power of emotion, music and poetry, or just enjoying ourselves as a group. Also, the assembly format is very accessible to families with children and seems to attract a variety of ages.

This could be due to a recent loss or a loss from many years ago and you may have pain that has resurfaced for any reason. Please note that I am not a grief counselor but what I do know is that I have lost 13 family members in 13 years and 2 of them were children. I lost 15 friends in 10 years. I lost them due to illness, accidents and suicide. My heart has been repeatedly broken but I do know that the heart can and will heal and I believe that we can do this together. I have attended several grief support groups over the years and I can tell you that by telling your story and helping others....you also, will begin to heal. I believe that it is a great help and part of the healing process to just sit back, talk, listen, share and be a part of a group that \"just gets it.\" Coping skills is another great topic of discussion. Believe me...it really does and will help you to talk to others that \"have walked that road.\" We are all in this together as one.\u00a0 I would also like this to be an opportunity for you to grab something to eat or a coffee.\u00a0 I just wanted to let you know that you will have time to do that if you would like to purchase something. \u00a0 I look forward to meeting you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jan<br>\n\n<\/p>","lon":-79.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":151836692,"name":"Jan"},"members":177,"name":"Pittsburgh Grief Support Meetup","id":17012202,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Grief-Support-Meetup","category":{"name":"support","id":33,"shortname":"support"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Grief Support Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1410876587000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"editing","name":"Editing","id":15324},{"urlkey":"copy-editing","name":"Copy Editing","id":52946},{"urlkey":"editors","name":"Editors","id":62988},{"urlkey":"editing-and-proofreading","name":"Editing and Proofreading","id":133617},{"urlkey":"freelance-editors","name":"Freelance Editors","id":291461},{"urlkey":"proofreaders","name":"Proofreaders","id":1497762}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Editorial-Freelancers\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are writers and editors and proofreaders... all involved in working with words.&nbsp; We get together to update our skills, to share skills, and to do some networking.&nbsp; Here is a great piece on why it is so important to learn continuously: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.copyediting.com\/schedule-learning-double-your-income\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.copyediting.com\/schedule-learnin...<\/a> <br> <\/p>","lon":-79.9100036621,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":2879015,"name":"Dorothy Drennen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/9\/6\/highres_229696022.jpeg","photo_id":229696022,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/9\/6\/member_229696022.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/e\/9\/6\/thumb_229696022.jpeg"}},"members":18,"name":"Pittsburgh Writers and Editors","id":17026652,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Editorial-Freelancers","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.4500007629,"who":"Writers,Editors, Proofreaders"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1411012543000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"spirituality","name":"Spirituality","id":10290},{"urlkey":"buddhist-meditation","name":"Buddhist Meditation","id":16887},{"urlkey":"spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","id":17658},{"urlkey":"zen-meditation","name":"Zen Meditation","id":17903},{"urlkey":"sangha","name":"Sangha","id":19437},{"urlkey":"zen-practice","name":"Zen Practice","id":24244},{"urlkey":"zen-buddhism","name":"Zen Buddhism","id":24720},{"urlkey":"dharma","name":"Dharma","id":29734},{"urlkey":"buddhist-philosophy","name":"Buddhist Philosophy","id":40822},{"urlkey":"mahayana-buddhism","name":"Mahayana Buddhism","id":69148},{"urlkey":"buddhist","name":"Buddhist","id":128602},{"urlkey":"buddhist-sangha","name":"Buddhist Sangha","id":166603},{"urlkey":"chinese-buddhism","name":"Chinese Buddhism","id":1489392}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Beginners-Mind-Zen-Meditation-Dharma-Ctr-Pittsburgh\/","rating":5,"description":"<p>We are a group of people who realize the benefits of a regular meditation practice in a group setting.

varying ways, the tools of communication change, but the ideas remain the same. \u00a0In this day, we have access to a writing tool unlike those available in the past: Google Docs. \u00a0This technology gives us new options for authorship, although in many ways the craft of writing has not changed.<\/p>\n<p>Google Docs is a free online tool that allows two or more people to edit the same document at the time and see the changes that the other person is making as they are being made. \u00a0Having this functionality allows for an immediacy of collaboration between writers in different locations in a way that could not have happened in the past. \u00a0As the word processor improved the craft of writing by making revisions easier, the question now is, how does this new tool change the way we communicate using the written word.<\/p>\n<p>This is a group for writers of all styles and all experience levels. \u00a0I have been a professional technical writer for more than ten years, serving as a journalist, writing content for the web, writing computer manuals, and writing fiction for my own amusement. \u00a0I look forward to using the tools of collaboration to help others:<\/p>\n<p>* \u00a0Learn to be more creative<br>\n\n * \u00a0Overcome writers' block<br>\n\n * \u00a0And to write more effectively<\/p>\n<p>During the Meetup we will write together, read what we have written, and collaboratively edit each other\u2019s writing. \u00a0The goal of this group will be to improve our communication with each other and with our intended audiences. \u00a0As I would hope for other members of the group, I aspire to being accepting of all recommendations about my writing as I strive to produce the best product that I can.<\/p>\n<p>Each participant will need a laptop or tablet for every Meetup. \u00a0You will also need a free Google email address if you do not already have one.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you

Looking forward to starting and continuing this group for regular monthly events.","lon":-80.1800003052,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":182579726,"name":"Jean Givner","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/4\/highres_241579988.jpeg","photo_id":241579988,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/4\/member_241579988.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/4\/e\/1\/4\/thumb_241579988.jpeg"}},"members":111,"name":"AAIM -African Americans In Moon","id":18194328,"state":"PA","urlname":"AAIM-African-Americans-In-Moon","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"lat":40.5099983215,"who":"AAIMers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1416429700000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"accounting","name":"Accounting","id":378},{"urlkey":"cashflow","name":"Cashflow","id":885},{"urlkey":"wealth-creation","name":"Wealth Creation","id":16839},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"strategy-games","name":"Strategy Games","id":17785},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"entrepreneurship","name":"Entrepreneurship","id":19882},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"game-night","name":"Game Night","id":40126},{"urlkey":"cashflow-game-night","name":"Cashflow Game Night","id":55828},{"urlkey":"cashflow-game","name":"Cashflow Game","id":66518},{"urlkey":"finance-and-wealth","name":"Finance and Wealth","id":66789},{"urlkey":"cashflow-101","name":"cashflow 101","id":89459}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-CashFlow-Game-Club-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"\u201cBoard games for the upwardly mobile\u201d - CNN\/Money IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF THE RAT RACE What's your dream?

This is an invitation to join me in gathering together like-minded women who've experienced life for a while :) and are in pursuit of similar interests as I. I am an ardent student of A Course In Miracles; Quantum Physics and especially a dedicated practice of the application of its principles; the pursuit of clear consciousness and lucidity; the practices of breathing (refer to Max Strom); the acquiring of wisdom (refer to Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna, Sufi, Anais Nin, Steve Treu, Gary Zukav, Deepak Chopra to name a few); yoga (I'm very new to it but enthusiastic about its physical and spiritual rewards); the offering of compassion and kindness; and complete responsibility for self. This isn't a therapeutic nor venting outlet but rather a discovery and growth arena. I am forming this potential meetup because as I've progressed I am finding that most of my good old friends (whom I still and will always value) are not on the same page as I am and I'd like to connect with new friends who may be on the same page or at least reading the same book (metaphorically speaking). I live in the North Hills of Pittsburgh and am happy to travel southeast and north up to an hour for gatherings. At this point, I have not set a specific meeting time because my first step is finding women who are interested in such a pursuit. So if you are interested, please send me a note.

Welcome to the South Hills Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group. Here you will meet other people interested in alternative health and naturopathic healing via therapeutic grade essential oils.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Young Living Essential Oils are the industry leaders in essential oils. In fact, they are the industry standard oils with massage therapists and in many alternative healing practices. They are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, an emerging therapy. See below for more information. They are also used in hospitals throughout the U.S. They are even used intravenously in the Nova Vita clinic in Ecuador. They are very different than food-grade and perfume-grade essential oils (EOs) sold in many health food stores. Most health food store essential oils and other \"knock off\" companies are either synthetic, a few molecules are changed, cut with alcohol and other ingredients or are distilled quickly at high temperatures for fast, mass production, hence making the oils more affordably appealing, yet with no healing properties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Young Living Essential Oils are true therapeutic-grade EOs. In fact, Gary Young coined the term therapeutic-grade for essential oils. They are the purest grade EOs on the market. They are the essence, the blood, the life force, the immune system of the tree, plant, shrub, bush, flower, fruit, seed, etc. Many households are learning how to replace many of their \"over-the-counters\" as well as prescription medications with therapeutic grade EOs. Children are learning to come to mommy or daddy for their lavender or peppermint oil when they need to be wound down or have a tummy ache! In fact, many pet lovers as well as veterinarian offices are working with the oils as well, with incredible success! Note: you only want to use true therapeutic-grade essential oils on your pets for safety purposes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that Young Living Essential Oils are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, a revolutionary way to bring balance and harmony to the body...physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is an emerging therapy in many massage therapist's offices, spas, alternative medicine clinics, etc. Raindrop Technique was created more than a decade ago. The molecules of therapeutic-grade EOs are so small they are the only substance on the planet which may actually cross the blood-brain barrier. You do not have to be a certified Raindrop Therapist to learn the technique or to give it to family and friends. You can also learn Raindrop to help boost your family and friend's immunity, such as during our cold winter months, by giving them Raindrop Technique. An additional note, oils for healing, cleansing and masach (hebrew word for anoint, which means to smear, spread or massage) are mentioned more than 250 times in the bible. There is an answer for everything through nature. Essential oils have been used for healing\/medicinal purposes since the beginning of time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for spending the time to get to know a little bit about Therapeutic-Grade Essential Oils and their incredible benefits!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are looking forward to \"Meetup\" with all of you!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To your Health &amp; Well Being,&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sharon Bovalina, Young Living Essential Oils&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Member # 1818592<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>* None of the statements on this site have been evaluated by the FDA.

Thus science has advanced and civilization has been enhanced. The truth of life as such and its function (living) should be said the highest and most mysterious subject in this regard. Throughout the human history, many different sources, scientific as well as religious, have all continuously studied from different aspects in order to unveil the truth of such a mystery. However, among them, only what the teachings of Buddha Sakiamuni (Gautama, Siddartha) revealed some 2500 years ago can be said to possess the most rational conviction and to be the most objectively promising. The makeup of human life and its living sustain and continue by means of the law of karmic cause and effect, which may also perfectly explain the reincarnation of a person. Not until the understanding of such mechanism of the process of life should any ultimate Truth, such as Voidness, Love, God, all are One, etc., be substantially meaningful.\n    Our Meetup will have two parts. One is to study the fundamental doctrines of Buddhism, the other is for the discussion or sharing of any Buddhist concepts from the comparative-religious point of view. We hope through attending the meeting everybody will get strongly inspired to know to conduct a more meaningful and valuable life.\n","lon":-80.1500015259,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":183341138,"name":"WENCHIN TSAI","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/a\/2\/highres_246002466.jpeg","photo_id":246002466,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/a\/2\/member_246002466.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/a\/2\/thumb_246002466.jpeg"}},"members":35,"name":"Sewickley Buddhist-Forum Meetup","id":18584022,"state":"PA","urlname":"Sewickley-Buddhist-Forum-Meetup","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.5499992371,"who":"Truth seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1431232100000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"meditation","name":"Meditation","id":1322},{"urlkey":"self-improvement","name":"Self-Improvement","id":3336},{"urlkey":"consciousness","name":"Consciousness","id":4417},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"authentic-movement","name":"authentic movement","id":19370},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"play","name":"Play","id":21564},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"self-exploration","name":"Self Exploration","id":29158},{"urlkey":"natural-movement","name":"Natural Movement","id":61500}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spiralis-Concept-in-the-Park\/","rating":0,"description":"We will be playing in the park.

The Steel Towns Trail Cycling Event takes riders along the GAP Trail alongside the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers, from West Newton through the historic steel towns of Boston, McKeesport, Duquesne, Homestead, The Waterfront and Pittsburgh\u2019s Southside. <\/p>\n<p>The trail, recently completed to Pittsburgh, has a packed, crushed limestone surface for a smooth ride. Built mainly on abandoned rail beds, the trail is nearly level with the average grade of less than 1 percent. The ride between West Newton and Pittsburgh follows the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers and travels through many historic local and reclaimed \u201cSteel City\u201d areas. Along the ride you will enjoy the rivers, historic industrial sights, parks, bike-only river bridges and other interesting cycling sights to make the day enjoyable and interesting while supporting the mission of American Red Cross. <\/p>\n<p>This is both a cycling event and fundraiser. There is a small registration fee, and Riders are asked to solicit donations for&nbsp;their cycling effort&nbsp;in support of the Red Cross . All proceeds from this ride will be donated to American Red Cross Disaster Relief and Military Family Support Services for our local Red Cross Chapters supporting Western Pennsylvania.

By claiming the energy of our dreams, working with the dreams and sharing them with other dreamers in a safe and encouraging space we can make great changes in our lives and find a source of creativity, fun and adventure within ourselves.<\/p> \n<p>The foundation of becoming an awakened dreamer is dream journaling. We'll present basic journaling techniques and how to encourage our Dream Source to send us more dreams. One we have dreams to work with we can share them with others in a safe way that encourages us to take the positive energy of our dreams to make changes in our waking life. We will also cover using dreams as a source of creativity and problem solving, as a path to our own inner spiritual guides and as a fun place for exploration and adventure.<\/p> \n<p>Once we become dreamers who are capturing and working with our dreams we can begin the real adventure. We are not limited to worldly concerns in dreaming and can use our dreams in near-infinite ways to expand our horizons and abilities and to have fun. We can use our dreams as the basis for creative works using the images directly or as the source for writing.

There is a lot of business to go around, I would love to share it with you! My personal goal is simple, give everyone that attends on a regular basis at least one referral per year. If we just had 10-12 consistent people with that philosophy, all of our lives would be better, stronger and happier!!!! Let's make this a reality. Let's get as many people as possible attending these events. Please feel free to send this out to anyone and everyone you know that would appreciate networking with a great group of people who desire to expand their sphere of influence.

This group is intended for an information exchange for all levels of badminton player, from casual\/recreational to competitive, from casual pickup to serious tournament players. Never played badminton indoors? Does badminton strike you as not athletically strenuous enough? Come, try badminton with actual lines on a suitable gym floor surface, and be prepared to sweat! Competitive badminton matches arguably involve as much speed and strategy as tennis matches, and a light difference in stroke can just as easily make the difference between in or out. Badminton players must react to their opponent's move more frequently than tennis because it takes far less time for a smashed birdie to fly from one end of the court to the other, being a smaller court and a more aerodynamic object. Badminton players can startle one another by changing the direction of play as suddenly as table tennis players except in badminton the opportunities to impart any meaningful degree of spin to the bird (except to a slight degree on a certain type of rare serve ) are almost non-existent and because the drag on the bird increases as the bird slows, there is a wider array of (velocity-dependent) trajectories available for attacking. With a light touch and clever decision-making, a less agile player with quick reactions and hand-eye coordination can often defeat a player in much better physical condition -- better play-making leads to less strenuous play, especially in doubles. These are some of the reasons that professional badminton is played in front of crowds of thousands in several European and Asian countries -- it is a fantastic sport and a very good workout for both mind and body. This Meetup is a place for individual players and established badminton groups throughout greater Pittsburgh to organize, exchange info, and potentially organize our region's badminton enthusiasts to exchange info with similar groups in other regions, potentially for inter-regional tournaments. My name is Isaak Berg, and I have enjoyed playing badminton regularly with a group who meets at the Hampton Community Center for the past few months. I learned to play competitively in high school and then for a few years while playing other sports. When you join, please let the group know about your interest or experience level in badminton, whether you are interested in joining a group, your age range, and the location, days or times you usually play or are hoping to play.","lon":-79.9499969482,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":111856842,"name":"Isaak Berg","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/0\/5\/highres_249641733.jpeg","photo_id":249641733,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/0\/5\/member_249641733.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/a\/3\/0\/5\/thumb_249641733.jpeg"}},"members":153,"name":"Pittsburgh Badminton","id":18877001,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Badminton","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Badminton players"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1440819208000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"architecture","name":"Architecture","id":1737},{"urlkey":"history","name":"History","id":7789},{"urlkey":"histpreserv","name":"Historic Preservation","id":8758},{"urlkey":"historic-buildings","name":"Historic Buildings","id":20911},{"urlkey":"historic-locations-and-people","name":"Historic Locations and People","id":23031},{"urlkey":"local-history","name":"local history","id":25191},{"urlkey":"architectural-and-historical-salvage","name":"Architectural and Historical Salvage","id":36398},{"urlkey":"local-events-history-and-culture","name":"Local Events, History and Culture","id":49950},{"urlkey":"historical-tours","name":"Historical Tours","id":73281},{"urlkey":"historic-restoration","name":"Historic Restoration","id":79273},{"urlkey":"historic-structures","name":"Historic Structures","id":86572},{"urlkey":"historic-house-tours","name":"Historic House Tours","id":88156},{"urlkey":"historical-preservation","name":"Historical Preservation","id":111914}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Historic-Preservation-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in historic preservation in Pittsburgh.

The philosophy behind the group is to have fun, enjoy the world around us, improve as individuals, learn, share your knowledge and help others. <br> <br>When Bill and I started weekly rides on the Northside two years ago, the idea was to introduce people to cycling and encourage them to get out and about. We wanted to make everyone feel welcomed and included. Since then, the weekly rides have grown into a large friendly group of people. Some of them were completely new to cycling when they joined. Others were seasoned warriors on two wheels. We got along and supported each other. Good friendships were forged. Great times were had. We felt that this group - In Gear Pittsburgh - would be a logical continuation of the tradition that was started on the Wednesday rides. <br> <br>The group is primarily about cycling. This includes all types of cycling - road, trail, touring, MTB etc. It also includes all levels of difficulty. We will continue our beginner level Wednesday rides but members are welcome to set up more challenging rides. All we ask for is to clearly indicate the level of difficulty in the ride description. <br> <br>Here comes the twist. In addition to cycling, we would like to include other activities, especially in the winter time. Some examples of events include: <br>Hiking <br>City walks <br>Bowling <br>Ice skating <br>Movie nights <br>Book discussion clubs <br>Live music events <br>Community oriented projects such as trail cleanup and community gardening <br>Bicycle maintenance workshops <br>Cooking demonstrations <br>Arts and crafts workshops <br> <br>The list is not exhaustive. If you have an idea in mind - all you have to do is suggest it. <br> <br>We would like to keep this group a friendly place. We don't believe in setting rules for the sake of rules, and the rules will be minimal. The idea is to relax and have fun while respecting others. Leave your personal drama and negativity behind and think positive. The group is open to all members regardless of their age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation etc. Discriminatory behavior, defamatory remarks or any form of aggression towards other members will not be tolerated. <br> <br>Thank you for joining and lets have fun!<\/p>","lon":-80.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/c\/9\/highres_443328585.jpeg","photo_id":443328585,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/c\/9\/600_443328585.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/d\/c\/9\/thumb_443328585.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":111132902,"name":"Alex","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/5\/c\/highres_251376956.jpeg","photo_id":251376956,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/5\/c\/member_251376956.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/0\/5\/c\/thumb_251376956.jpeg"}},"members":356,"name":"In Gear Pittsburgh","id":19051959,"state":"PA","urlname":"In-Gear-Pittsburgh","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.4700012207,"who":"In-Gear-Neers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1445553852000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"autism","name":"Autism","id":637},{"urlkey":"specialed","name":"Special Education","id":1677},{"urlkey":"adhd","name":"ADHD","id":12126},{"urlkey":"parents-of-aspergers-kids","name":"Parents of Kids with Asperger's","id":20322},{"urlkey":"autistic-spectrum-disorders","name":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders","id":21466},{"urlkey":"autism-moms","name":"Moms of Autistic Kids","id":23808},{"urlkey":"special-needs-families","name":"Special Needs Families","id":36792},{"urlkey":"high-functioning-autism","name":"High-Functioning Autism","id":52168},{"urlkey":"autism-spectrum-disorder","name":"Autism Spectrum Disorder","id":71211},{"urlkey":"asperger-syndrome","name":"Asperger Syndrome","id":77838},{"urlkey":"autism-social-group","name":"Autism Social Group","id":83966},{"urlkey":"autism-support-group","name":"Autism Support Group","id":88584},{"urlkey":"support-for-parents-of-special-needs-kids","name":"Support for Parents of Special Needs Kids","id":102721}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-parents-of-high-functioning-autistic-children\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you have a son or daughter between the ages of 7-13 who has been diagnosed with high functioning autism or Aspergers?

This group will help to serve as that corner.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>My name is Sonya Majors. I am the organizer of this group. We are in our infancy stage, so things will be changing and evolving as time goes on. My vision is to create a network of women of color to help support and challenge each other. A no drama sounding board, where you can market your product or service, get advice, vent or just share a few laughs. I hope we will all grow in our own career and business endeavors as well as enjoy the company of other like minded women of color. Work hard. Play hard.<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>While membership is open to all, the concentration of the group will be around the challenges that women of color face and African American culture. Partially because that is my upbringing; that is what I know best. That being said, the principles that should drive us are universal.

This group is for women who are working full-time, part-time, or even just one day a week who could use the support and friendship of other women trying to balance being a mom and having a job.

Our set of 8 bells range from 496 Lbs to 960 Lbs in weight and and are controlled manually by ringers in a room below the bells using only ropes!<\/p>\n<p>Change ringing is a 400 year old tradition of bell ringing that started in England, which is still home to 5,000 towers. It was imported to colonial America, the first tower here being the famous Old North Church in Boston, where one of the original ringers was Paul Revere. Bells weighing hundreds or thousands of pounds are swung through 360 degrees several dozen feet above the ringers, using just ropes and skill to produce cascades of sound according to centuries old patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Although tower bells are quite heavy, they are precisely balances and therefore can be rung by young and old alike. &nbsp;Ringing is moderately intensive exercise, especially for the upper body, and does require, to some degree, a certain sense of rhythm. &nbsp;Beyond this, qualifications are few. &nbsp;One need not be big, strong, musical, or mathematical to ring. Nor does one need to belong to Southminser Church in order to ring. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>We encourage anyone interested in learning to ring to contact the Pittsburgh Change Ringing Guild.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Check out a couple videos below to see the bells and ringers in action before making your first visit to the tower!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Bells swinging:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=liuRptmR088<\/a> <br>Ringers pulling ropes:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M1vSfNF7OfI<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Learn more about the art of Change Ringing here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nagcr.org\/pamphlet.html\">http:\/\/www.nagcr.org\/pamphlet.html<\/a><\/p>","lon":-79.9499969482,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/highres_446340124.jpeg","photo_id":446340124,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/600_446340124.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/c\/thumb_446340124.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":162545482,"name":"Matthew Nelson","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/6\/e\/highres_253291342.jpeg","photo_id":253291342,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/6\/e\/member_253291342.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/a\/6\/e\/thumb_253291342.jpeg"}},"members":11,"name":"Pittsburgh Change Ringing Guild","id":19442348,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Change-Ringing-Guild","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"lat":40.4700012207,"who":"Ringers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Oakmont","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1453924456000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"weightloss","name":"Weight Loss","id":240},{"urlkey":"marathon","name":"Marathon","id":401},{"urlkey":"triathlon","name":"Triathlon","id":1155},{"urlkey":"running","name":"Running","id":2516},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"wellness","name":"Wellness","id":10306},{"urlkey":"group-fitness-training","name":"Group Fitness Training","id":15394},{"urlkey":"half-marathon","name":"Half Marathon","id":17323},{"urlkey":"healthy-living","name":"Healthy Living","id":20221},{"urlkey":"fun-run","name":"Fun Run","id":20719},{"urlkey":"free-running","name":"Free Running","id":22838},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"training-for-fun-runs","name":"Training For Fun Runs","id":32720},{"urlkey":"long-distance-running","name":"Long Distance Running","id":38289}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Race-training-while-being-healthy-having-fun\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Howdy!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>I set this group up for anyone interested in running &amp; training with a group and still HAVING Fun! &nbsp; I'm training for the Pittsburgh half marathon and I believe that training for a half marathon or full doesn't have to be hard!&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>I would say I have love &amp; hate relationship with running but that fuels the passion to run a faster race and to have more fun doing it.&nbsp; I also thought that we would try to set up a weekly group run, this could be a meetup for finding a couple of people to run (even last minute) because running is more fun when you're running with friends.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>So if it's Monday at 4, and you want to do a run at North Park, cool, post it and people can respond.&nbsp; Tues night at 9 pm and you're stressed out and want to do a run at 5:30 am the next morning?&nbsp; Cool, I mean no, not cool, are you nuts?&nbsp; 5:30am?&nbsp; You're probably flying solo on this one.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just teasing, you all get the idea.&nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>Because larger group runs are fun to.&nbsp; Organizing one weekly run which to start is Saturday at 3:00pm&nbsp; we'll introduce ourselves and wait for anyone who might get lost and then do a 3 - 5 mile run to the casinos and back.

We can meet at my home or a public place and share one another's personal concerns, worries, fears, joys and good times including \"i've been there!\" experiences.

These can be extremely uncomfortable, even painful, especially in the very early stages of these development exercises.&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Intense buzzing, tingling, tickling, and bone-deep vibrating energy-movement sensations are commonly felt. These may continue for some time, even after the awareness actions that caused them have been discontinued. This will sometimes be accompanied by nervous twitching and muscular spasming in the feet and legs. This can also be quite strong in the early stages. &nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>All these sensations are normal for this type of energetic development work. The degree of sensations felt indicates the degree of resistance to the energy being raised. Strong energy-movement sensations are caused by larger-than-normal amounts of energy being forced through narrowed energy pathways and conduits. This over-stimulates the nerves in the skin and surrounding tissue near the affected energy pathways.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;Energy Bounce Techniques&nbsp; <br> Energy bounce is a simple and effective awareness technique that helps to clear, redefine, and strengthen all energy pathways<\/b> <br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/5\/0\/7\/600_446614055.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>What you do is ....You are &nbsp;taking &nbsp;awareness of the feeling from the itchy -tingling sensation from the brushing&nbsp;methods or the index finger circling method &nbsp;...Taking that feeling&nbsp;making&nbsp;into an awareness and&nbsp;thinking it&nbsp;through one or both legs, from feet to hips. then bounce repeatedly from feet to hips. You will quickly develop a natural rhythm and will feel the slight dragging effect it has in your energy body. Energy-movement sensations in the bounce area are usually quite mild.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Continue bouncing for at least a minute, or for as long as you wish. It's quite a pleasant sensation when you get used to it and the bounce action quickly becomes almost automatic. Try splitting awareness and bouncing through- both legs at the same time.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <\/p>\n<p><b>Full-Body Bounce<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>The full-body bounce takes awareness up and down through the entire body. This can be done from any position...I do this daily all day long for the last 43 yrs&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Take awareness from both feet, up through legs, torso, head, and arms, all the way to just above fingertips. Bounce awareness back and forth, from feet to fingertips. The bounce rhythm should be fairly quick, about one or two seconds each way, but whatever feels most natural is best. Try to feel the whole of your body, inside and out, with each full-body bounce. <br> <br> A variation of the above is with arms resting at your sides, where awareness is bounced from your feet to just above the top of your head. This is far more practical when sitting or standing.&nbsp; <br> <br> Keep in mind, after working so laboriously and painstakingly through your newly discovered energy body, that this is only the early training part. The NEW system is very progressive and, once you learn it, large parts of your energy body will quickly begin responding to single awareness actions. The smaller parts of the stimulation exercises given so far quickly combine into larger and simpler whole-of-limb stimulation and energy-raising actions.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> Everything starts getting easier, faster, and more effective once this happens.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p><b>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br> <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Spinal Bounce<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>This is the&nbsp;finally&nbsp;step...and should be performed in bed when you meditate..... and your on your way to&nbsp;Spiritual Enlightenment or&nbsp;Spiritual Awakening read about it on line ..thats what the Vibration is all about..Its Beautiful you can feel the trees and plants and your closer to the world.....<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b> <br><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>This is a wonderful technique if you suffer back tension or spinal pain. I have a few spinal injuries myself and find this very soothing and healing. Once you master the spinal bounce, you can set it in motion and use your mind for other things. Only a small part of your mind is required to keep the bounce action going in the background. This promotes deep physical relaxation, helps ease knots of tension in the spine, as well as gently stimulating the spinal roots of most primary centers.&nbsp; <br> <br> Awareness-target the coccyx (tailbone) at the base of the spine. Move awareness along the full length of your spine to the top of your head. Bounce awareness back and forth, from top to bottom, feeling it all the way. Increase speed and adjust frequency, then slow to a more comfortable rhythm - about half a second or so in each direction. Take care to breathe naturally while doing this. The spinal bounce action tends to interfere with the natural breathing pattern....take a couple of deep breathes when doing &nbsp;this...<\/b><b>==========================================================================&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>&nbsp; Will will be sitting in Chairs &nbsp;during this meetup....So no lotus positions please.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thing that you might &nbsp;need &nbsp;to bring <b>Hairbrush.. or a soft paint brush...or you can use your index finger ...but brushes&nbsp;work&nbsp;better.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Please no negative thoughts ....just be&nbsp;positive&nbsp;thoughts....<\/b><\/p>\n<p>other things you can do before you come to the meetup or what I like to do<\/p>\n<p><span>I try not to eat any heavy meats and try to be a &nbsp;vegan before that meetup<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>I like getting Pedicures where they sand the bottom of the feet...

I'm looking for others to share ideas with and also workout. We can go to local parks when the weather is better. Right now I usually hole up at LA Fitness in the class room when it is free. I'll give you some examples: Cardio (steps, running in place, jumping rope, sprints) 30 seconds short rest Chest (standard, wide, feet elevated, with a twist, dips) 30 seconds short rest Legs (squats, lunges, and variations with medicine balls) short rest abs (planks, side planks, full body crunch etc.) Squats (and variations) 30 seconds short rest You would then repeat that 3 times. Then take a 1-2 minute rest. That would be one circuit then start over again. You would try to do as many circuits as you could up to 3-5. I do other variations of this when I have gym equipment: Max Rep Pull ups (or assisted) Max Rep Dips (or assisted) 30 seconds Mountain Climbers Max Rep Squats Max Rep Chest Press Max Rep Shoulder Press 30 Seconds Cardio 30 seconds abs Max dips or curls Max Rep kettlebell swings Max Rep Lunges 30 Seconds abs Max Rep Deadlifts Max Hold Wall Sit Max Rep Burpees That would be one circuit. Then you repeat as many times as you can. I usually do 2-3 depending on how much time I have. I'm no personal trainer or anything but someone who is having good results with these types of workouts. It would even be cool to do them in the park in the summer and add sprints and maybe find pull up bars. Anyway, looking for others to get creative with doing some of these.","lon":-79.9199981689,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64561032,"name":"Jeffrey Yakulis","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/0\/3\/highres_253887395.jpeg","photo_id":253887395,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/0\/3\/member_253887395.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/0\/3\/thumb_253887395.jpeg"}},"members":189,"name":"Pittsburgh High Intensity Workout Group","id":19573038,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-High-Intensity-Workout-Group","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":40.4300003052,"who":"HIIT'ERS"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Pittsburgh","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1455544398000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"games","name":"Games","id":15992}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Pittsburgh-Chess-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"This is for chess enthusiasts.

This particular group is for all heterosexual people who are looking to date. Are you recently divorced or 20 years out of a divorce? Are you widowed and thinking you want to get back out there? Are you single and starting over? THIS is the place to be...this introduction just might be a new chapter for you. We have either heard it all or been there....meeting the wrong people, the wrong types, online, offline...the list goes on. We have often heard not enough men at an event.....not enough women at an event.....people want to be text friends only....this group wants to change that and the way people think. A common complaint is that when meeting online...pictures are 20 years old and the person was nothing like the profile. I will ask for a picture and a few short questions so that we get to know everyone better and here is the best part---you WILL get to meet in a group setting and judge for yourselves. That first introduction is KEY. There will never be a charge for this group. I want you to be able to come and go and sign up for events as you see fit. I encourage anyone in or out of the area to join us because you just never know when the right opportunity knocks...and just think...what if you were not there to answer the door? LOL---(someone else is dating your perfect match) LOL.....Remember God put eyes on our face instead of the back of our head so we will always look forward and not back. I do have a few ground rules. 1. No players--this is not a game and you are no longer 24. 2. No clowns---this is not a circus. 3. No stalking---when someone tells you that they are not interested.... Believe them. Issues such as the above mentioned will not be tolerated. Just ask my friends in Meetup. You will be deleted from the group. I think that this could be a great way to get out there and just put it on the table and openly say that you are interested in dating. Please be single, divorced or widowed and if you are not----someone will tell ---Guaranteed ---so please be HONEST! Join us and just have FUN!!! Be open to this and receive it! You just may shock yourself. : )&nbsp; This group will start out at Panera in the Conference Room to meet and greet and then we will move on for a drink or two and a local venue.<br><\/p>","lon":-79.9100036621,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":151836692,"name":"Jan"},"members":160,"name":"Pittsburgh Meet and Greet Dating Event Ages 45-60","id":19648371,"state":"PA","urlname":"Pittsburgh-Meet-and-Greet-Dating-Event-Ages-45-60","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"lat":40.5,"who":"Potential Perfect Daters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Cranberry Twp","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1456888526000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fibromyalgia","name":"Fibromyalgia","id":879},{"urlkey":"disabilityrts","name":"Disability Rights","id":3620},{"urlkey":"eds","name":"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome","id":6480},{"urlkey":"chronicillness","name":"Chronic Illness","id":10479},{"urlkey":"hidden-disabilities","name":"Hidden Disabilities","id":15586},{"urlkey":"support","name":"Support","id":19925},{"urlkey":"autoimmune-disease","name":"Autoimmune Disease","id":24235},{"urlkey":"adults-with-special-needs-disabilities","name":"Adults with Special Needs, Disabilities","id":63050},{"urlkey":"coping-with-chronic-illnesses","name":"Coping with Chronic Illnesses","id":90731},{"urlkey":"chiari-malformation-support","name":"Chiari Malformation Support","id":223671},{"urlkey":"mast-cell-activation-disorder","name":"Mast Cell Activation Disorder","id":844512},{"urlkey":"joint-hypermobility-syndrome","name":"Joint Hypermobility Syndrome","id":967482},{"urlkey":"invisible-chronic-illness","name":"Invisible chronic illness","id":1392132}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cranberry-Twp-Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is a support group for people with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Joint Hypermobility, Connective Tissue Disease, and other related hidden chronic illnesses.

Introducing the new (and unimproved) Mr. Bill's Friday Night South Hills Over-Fifty Meetup. <br><\/p>\n<p>Events won't always necessarily be on Friday nights; we might do an outdoors, hiking, or park event on a Saturday afternoon. and you don't have to be over fifty to join, there's no restriction on age (or anything else, for that matter.) <br><\/p>\n<p>Two of the mainstay activities will be current films at an area multiplex, and nice, middle price range restaurants, including Chinese. I have the necessary skill set for both activities. I also want to set up a billiards (and beer!) event, which could become a once-a-month staple event if there's enough interest. <br><\/p>\n<p>I'll accept all the help I can get putting this together (I have no idea what I'm doing.) But we're going to make this something great. I'm working on a group discount at a multiplex theater, if anyone can help with this, or wants to be an assistant organizer, my email is zaphod.six@gmail.com. <br><\/p>\n<p>This will be <b>your <\/b>group; someone just had to take the initiative to get it started. I'll always listen to suggestions, esp. restaurants and other possible activities for the group. And I will be there for all events, that's a given. There will be no fees or dues. The one thing I'm going to be hard-nosed about: when you sign up for a specific event, please be there. Especially for restaurant events, where we have to reserve seating in advance. <br><\/p>\n<p>One other thing. I've been to a few meetups where the place was full of cigarette smoke. <b>That<\/b> won't happen!!

Some great ONLINE ones, but I want one like my buddies have in Texas. A group that meets each month. Teaches something each month. Organizes Trips and Classes. Classes on REAL Tactical Weapons (Pistol, Carbine, Shotgun). NOT just an \"NRA Level 1A class\" but a tactical class that will have you shooting 400-600 rounds per day. When someone in the group is going to butcher rabbits or get in a shipment of Chicks or Ducklings I want them to feel welcome and open enough to invite over those from the group that want to learn. For those who run a big garden, want a bunch of help planting? I want those in the group that want to learn planting to be able to come over and help you plant. I want it to be a community from the community. Come to the 1st Meeting, probably at the Pine Twp Community Center on April 28th 2016 7pm - 9pm. We ONLY have room for 50 people.
