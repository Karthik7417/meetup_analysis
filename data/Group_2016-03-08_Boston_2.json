Our practice is 90 minutes of traditional Japanese karate with direct lineage to Gichin Funakoshi and includes kihon, kumite and kata. Practitioners of all levels are welcome. You will receive the highest caliber instruction. Come experience Boston\u2019s best kept secret!<\/p>\n<p>Practice is on Mondays and Thursdays from 7:15 \u2013 9.00 P.M. and Saturdays from 10:15 A.M. to Noon.<\/p>\n<p>Karate-do is the Way of the Empty Hand. It is derived from the ancient Okinawan fighting style and heavily influenced by the Chinese martial arts. The style of karate we practice is the traditional Shotokan as practiced from the time of Gichin Funakoshi. We are affiliated with Shotokan Karate of America (SKA).<\/p>\n<p>Master Gichin Funakoshi introduced karate-do to mainland Japan in 1916. He had been initiated into all the major Okinawan karate methods and taught a synthesis of the Okinawan styles as a total discipline. This method became known as Shotokan. Because of the great popularity of the style in Japan and, later, around the world, Funakoshi is widely considered to be the \u201cfather of modern karate-do. Aside from creating Shotokan karate and introducing it to Japan and the world, Funakoshi Sensei also wrote several books, one of which is \u201cKarate-Do Kyohan\u201d - The Master Text, which is the \u201chandbook\u201d of Shotokan. The original Japanese text of Karate-Do Kyohan was translated into English by Tsutomu Ohshima in 1973.<\/p>\n<p>We practice Shotokan karate in the traditional manner for the development of mind, body, and spirit. This art form has been passed down from teachers to students in an unbroken line from Funakoshi Sensei himself to Ohshima Sensei to us. We believe it is the responsibility of each practitioner to learn and practice the techniques correctly so that the tradition is preserved and can be passed on intact to the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>Shotokan Karate of America is a national nonprofit organization that has been teaching traditional karate-do in the United States since 1955. SKA was founded and is still led by Tsutomu Ohshima, who is one of Master Funakoshi Sensei\u2019s last direct pupils. In 1955 Mr. Ohshima came to the United States and was the first person to teach karate to the U.S. public.

I have had a passion all of my life in the areas of wellness, self-improvement and the mind-body-spirit connection. I have experience in areas of Community Health, Oncology, Case Management, General Med-Surgical, Orthopedic, and Emergency Nursing. This experience as a Nurse has given me understanding of how all people - patients, their caregivers and the health care workers are affected by stress and burnout. Yoga became my LIFELINE when I was working night shift in the ER - It helped me so much to destress and ultimately take action towards regaining balance in my life.

For example, I have a section of my basement that I want to clean up and get rid of stuff I don't need. And I never do it. I'd contact someone in the network (or someone would contact me, if they feel so moved) and we will agree to meet in my basement at a specific time, for one to three hours, and do what needs to be done. I may agree to barter with my support person the same amount of time, where I help him or her another day; or I may just receive the support as a gift, if my person isn't trading or doesn't need support in anything at this time, or prefers that someone else does it; or maybe just believes \"what goes around comes around.\" Whatever.\n\nYou may want a different kind of support, such as to change careers or some action that takes a more sustained effort than simply cleaning up a basement. You'd find someone, or several someones, for that.\n\nYou may wish to volunteer and helps others, even though you don't need support.\n\nYou may be in a tough situation or very challenging time in life, and really need support; so you just receive help, without any compulsion to give back at this time.\n\nI also wish to have more fun and more company in life! \"Many hands make light work\" is an old saying I find quite true.

Our meetups will be in the form of Laughter Yoga and Meditation sessions followed by brief discussions about laughter and play in our lives. \u00a0Laughter Yoga and Meditation involves simple movements, breathing, and obviously laughter, and is open to all ages. \u00a0Comfortable clothing is a plus but Laughter Yoga and Meditation isn't your usually yoga class so no special attire, mats, or props required although you'd be quite surprised on how much a workout continuous laughter can be. \u00a0No previous experience in yoga, meditation, or having a sense of humor necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin and I\u00a0started this group because we like to play and laugh, and laughter yoga was one of\u00a0the best ways we have found to fulfill that basic need. There are many proven physical\u00a0and psychological health benefits to the practice, which have been backed by peer-reviewed studies, but speaking to people about laughter yoga what comes up often\u00a0is that people feel they\u2019re not having enough fun in their life. We would like to\u00a0address that.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Which brings up the question: What is laughter yoga? Despite the name, there are\u00a0<br>\n\nno physical poses. What it takes from yoga is the attitude of practice \u2013 the idea isn\u2019t\u00a0<br>\n\nto be the best at doing the exercises, but simply to start where you are and begin\u00a0<br>\n\nto develop, over time, an innate and core aspect of your humanity. While yoga\u00a0<br>\n\nconcentrates mainly on the body, this practice focuses primarily on the capacity for\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter and playfulness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Laughter is by its nature contagious, so while it may begin like \"fake\" laughter, it\u00a0<br>\n\noften turns into real authentic laughter. \u00a0Playful exercises are generally the types of games you would play with a young\u00a0child.<\/p>\n<p>Time Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker (subscription needed for\u00a0<br>\n\nfull article) have all written about laughter yoga. Though he has no affiliation with\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter yoga, Dr. Stuart Brown gave an interesting TED talk on the importance\u00a0<br>\n\nof play to the human brain.

We aren't asking for advice or a quick fix, but we are eager to be honest and create deep connection with others who aspire to stay present, share, and mindfully celebrate our vulnerabilities in ourselves, each other and the wider world.<\/p>\n<p><b>Locations in Boston, Cambridge &amp; Weymouth!<\/b> <br> <\/p>","lon":-71.0999984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":10759397,"name":"Christine White","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/highres_8049434.jpeg","photo_id":8049434,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/member_8049434.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/d\/a\/thumb_8049434.jpeg"}},"members":196,"name":"Free-Writing Women in Boston, Cambridge & Weymouth","id":14358182,"state":"MA","urlname":"Free-Writing-Women","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":42.3400001526,"who":"Free-Writing Women"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1399663703000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"creative-writing","name":"Creative Writing","id":15322},{"urlkey":"authors","name":"Authors","id":15844},{"urlkey":"writing","name":"Writing","id":16728},{"urlkey":"writing-workshops","name":"Writing Workshops","id":18167},{"urlkey":"novel-writing","name":"Novel Writing","id":20576},{"urlkey":"critique-group","name":"Critique Group","id":34868},{"urlkey":"short-stories","name":"Short Stories","id":62138},{"urlkey":"beginners-creative-writing","name":"Beginners Creative Writing","id":149837},{"urlkey":"creative-writing-group","name":"Creative Writing Group","id":1081732}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Dorchester-Writers\/","rating":4.79,"description":"<p>This is a group for writers in Dorchester and South Boston (and other neighbors, of course).

(Joomla and WordPress are also CMSs.) Drupal is used to create and manage all kinds of web content. Though Drupal is very powerful as a framework to build websites of all kinds, it is nevertheless remarkably user-friendly. Drupal empowers people from all walks of life, with little previous web design or development skills to relatively easily create dynamic websites with all sorts of bells and whistles. Of course easier doesn\u2019t mean effortless! A growing number of educational, Fortune 500, governments, and nonprofits already use it or are now migrating to Drupal. Places like the MIT Media Lab, The White House, The United Nations, Amnesty International, Best Buy, Zappos, FedEx, and The Economist use Drupal.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>About Best Bilingual Solutions, Inc. : Best Bilingual is a startup publishing house based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that publishes printed, digital and audio books in all the major and many of the minor languages of the world. The company has so far published four titles in up to eight different languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and French, with many more titles and languages to come in the near future, in printed, audio, and eBook formats.

Sometimes being a a single mom is just plain tough-there is no one to share the enchanting moments and tantrums with, no one to read a book to our child while we take a shower, no one to reassure us that we're doing just fine. I knew there had to be other women like me out there looking for connection and support and that's why I started this group.

New members joined after the original members completed the training program, so we've evolved into a more free-form workout-buddy thing where new runners are welcome to start the interval training, old runners are able to do 5K time improver exercises or longer runs according to their own preferences, and everything stays social by scheduling workouts by time instead of by distance so that we all warm up and cool down together. The track is open to the public and I've seen people running, walking, and interval training regardless of what time I've been there, so it's been perfect. There's parking on the street for Somerville residents and a small commuter lot that the campus police seem to ignore. However - we're in a state of transition since we're getting into winter. Because it's been too cold out for regular runs, we've switched over to doing runs every week or two for social reasons\/to get somewhere cool, like the recent runs to Bantam Cider and Downeast Cider. We've talked about Aeronaut Brewery in Cambridge and a few restaurants and festivals. Those runs are around 2 miles and that's the perfect distance to get there in about the same amount of time whether you're running intervals or just doing a straight jog, or faster if you're already really great at it. There's a virtual event posted for a fictional date in March - it's a place to suggest runs, which will then then turn into events. If you see something you'd like to try, please suggest!\u00a0 You can always +1 if you'd like to bring a friend. In the spring, we'll go back to 3 times per week.\u00a0 Send me a message if you have any questions, post comments in events if you have ideas, and I hope to meet you soon!<br>\n\n-Katie<\/p>","lon":-71.0899963379,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":44894232,"name":"Steve","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/0\/highres_167427552.jpeg","photo_id":167427552,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/0\/member_167427552.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/b\/a\/0\/thumb_167427552.jpeg"}},"members":145,"name":"Terrible Runners' Association:  Couch to 5K","id":15731332,"state":"MA","urlname":"Terrible-Runners-Association-Couch-to-5K","category":{"name":"fitness","id":9,"shortname":"fitness"},"lat":42.3899993896,"who":"Future Athletes"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Maynard","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1405569250000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"anime","name":"Anime","id":286},{"urlkey":"dnd","name":"Dungeons & Dragons","id":553},{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"yugioh","name":"Yu-Gi-Oh","id":1424},{"urlkey":"pokemon","name":"Pokemon","id":2602},{"urlkey":"warmachine","name":"WarMachine","id":9056},{"urlkey":"tabletop-role-playing-and-board-games","name":"Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games","id":16714},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"dungeons-dragons-3-5","name":"Dungeons & Dragons 3.5","id":20367},{"urlkey":"pathfinder-roleplaying-game","name":"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game","id":27294},{"urlkey":"trading-card-games","name":"Trading Card Games","id":28488},{"urlkey":"super-smash-bros","name":"Super Smash Bros.","id":30409},{"urlkey":"role-playing-games-rpgs","name":"Role-Playing Games","id":52140},{"urlkey":"mtg-casual-play-drafts-tournaments","name":"MTG Casual Play, Drafts, Tournaments","id":52407}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Excelsior-Comics-and-Games\/","rating":4.98,"description":"This is a group so everyone can keep up and in touch with the many events that we will be running at Excelsior comics and games.

As a modern way of knowing, Anthroposophy is non-denominational, and open to all who are on (or seeking) a spiritual path, and wish to share the fruits of their efforts with others. Although general in nature, it should be noted that our activities and the topics of our discussions are often based on or around the work of philosopher and spiritual scientist, Rudolf Steiner.

We welcome people from all different religious, social, and political backgrounds; people with disabilities, whether they are blind, deaf, need to use a wheelchair etc.; and people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual\/demisexual, transgender, genderqueer, agender, bigender, intersex, other queer, questioning, and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Obviously, in a group like this, people are bound to be occasionally uncomfortable with some of the topics being discussed. &nbsp;Please remember that all topics are permitted, provided that those involved in the discussion can provide evidence-based reasoning to back up their viewpoint. If there is a topic that makes you uncomfortable, we will not stop debating it. I would instead encourage you to take a walk and unwind, branch off at another table with other people and discuss something else, or leave and come back next time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Name-calling and ad hominem attacks are unacceptable. Attack people's ideas, not the person themselves. You may say things like, \"That idea is fucked up\" or \"Oh, God, do you believe that?\"; these debates tend to get quite impassioned!

The premise is simple: to deliver a night specifically tailored for a globally sophisticated crowd. Making Sundays at Minibar the premier destination for a wide variety of globally minded individuals, including but not limited to: young professionals, local socialites and fashion enthusiasts. Given the wide variety of backgrounds and nationalities, music genres rotate on a weekly basis. The night has become one of the top attractions for some of Boston's best DJs, the kind of individuals who share the vision and passion of the night's message. Where some Sundays might appear more like Salsa nights, others would be geared towards EDM, Top 40s, open-format or even Mediterranean music. Additionally, we hold fashion shows and other special themed nights (ex. Masquerade parties). International Sundays at Minibar have been going for about two years now, making Sundays one of Boston's longest continuously running nights. Upscale dress code is mandatory and admission is RSVP based. No, there is no cover. If I could cut the longer story short I would simply say that: we've built more than a typical night here, we've built a family.

Data Driven Apps effortlessly bring together your business data with your streaming big data, enabling real-time decisions.  These Apps are fast, focused, quick to deploy, and easily extensible. They are built to address a specific use case and be modified by your analysts as your business requirements change.

It's \"summer\" all year long now for us! We can do what we want, when we want! No more waiting for weekends and then having to try to find parking in crowded lots etc. We are free! I retired from teaching this year and am looking for others who would love to get together for some fun (outdoors preferably) whenever we feel like it! Especially during the week when others are working and places are not crowded. While we will set-up activities to look forward to, those who are up for \"last minute\" gatherings can share their preferred \"instant contact\" info and we can text, email or call one another to invite for spontaneous fun.<br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>I love to hike (easy to moderate), bike (same), kayak, scuba when in warm waters and explore new places. I also love to travel and think it would be great to have some friends to travel with. (Right now I'm looking at ways to explore New Zealand and Australia and environs, but I am open to anything.) I'll even learn to play cards again when the nights are long and the weather not so inviting. Don't let my \"lack of focus\" scare you- it's just about being OPEN to whatever sounds like fun as the moments arise and acting on it- with friends. I'm so happy to be retired!

We will probably be playing 1 game a week. Not required to play every single game, just the ones you want to play.<\/p>\n<p>Address of field will be given when a game is set up. We will play mostly in Quincy but probably not at the same field each week due to other peoples' events. Let's all have fun, meet new people, and enjoy a game of football.<\/p>\n<p>Members are more than welcome to invite guests, but please inform me and the group first so we can set up games correctly. Thank you.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Next Spring (2016) we will be including baseball in our schedule. <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0599975586,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/6\/highres_432898982.jpeg","photo_id":432898982,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/6\/600_432898982.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/6\/6\/6\/thumb_432898982.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":127042002,"name":"Hung","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/0\/5\/highres_249628677.jpeg","photo_id":249628677,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/0\/5\/member_249628677.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/0\/0\/5\/thumb_249628677.jpeg"}},"members":149,"name":"Quincy Flag Football & Baseball Pick-Ups","id":18282622,"state":"MA","urlname":"Quincy-Football-And-Baseball","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"lat":42.3100013733,"who":"Players"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Maynard","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1419958207000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"pregnancy","name":"Pregnancy","id":239},{"urlkey":"babies","name":"Babies","id":15461},{"urlkey":"new-moms","name":"New Moms","id":16208},{"urlkey":"first-time-pregnant-moms","name":"First-Time Pregnant Moms","id":20676},{"urlkey":"support-during-first-pregnancy","name":"Support During First Pregnancy","id":20677},{"urlkey":"new-parents","name":"New Parents","id":30112},{"urlkey":"expecting-moms","name":"Expecting Moms","id":47157},{"urlkey":"pregnant-mom-support","name":"Pregnant Mom Support","id":55500},{"urlkey":"expecting-parents","name":"Expecting Parents","id":726142}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-and-Expecting-Moms-of-Maynard-and-surrounding-towns\/","rating":4.99,"description":"<p>This group is for new or expecting moms who are interested in sharing experiences and supporting each other through pregnancy and parenting.

We are serious about having fun together. We will learn about Boston while honing our photography skills. And after class we always make time for socializing with food and drinks in the neighborhood we are exploring together.<\/p>\n<p>If you've ever wanted to learn how to take better photos, but you don't want to get bogged down with all the technical stuff, then you're going to love this.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This meetup group is for you if:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<i>You own a camera (or smart phone with a camera) and you'd really like to use it more, but you're not really sure where to start and what to do.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022\u00a0You would like to explore different neighborhoods in Boston like Chinatown, The North End, and Beacon Hill.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022\u00a0You enjoy meeting likeminded people from different cultures who love photography.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022\u00a0Maybe you've taken a photography workshop before or tried picking up one of those thick, boring books, but you quickly got overwhelmed and overloaded with the technical stuff.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u2022\u00a0You don't intend on becoming a \"master photographer\", but you'd like to learn how to take better pictures of things you find interesting.

The techniques you'll learn will have an immediate impact on your photography. You'll see an instant improvement and you'll also have an opportunity to get positive and constructive feedback for your work in a supportive environment.<\/span><br>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>If that sounds good to you, then I invite you to join our group. You'll learn a lot, meet some warm and wonderful people, and have lots of fun while you improve your photography, your English, and your knowledge of Boston.

You and the kids are going to LOVE our weekly adventures! <br> <\/p>\n<p>Our group meets YEAR-ROUND every Tuesday at 10am at various hiking trails in the metrowest area. It's a great opportunity to meet up with friends and enjoy some relaxing outside time and learn some new trails mostly likely right in your back yard! These events are FREE and appropriate for children up to 6 years. <br> <\/p>\n<p>Previously, I was a part of a great hiking group closer to Boston that met every week. Even though I have moved to the 'burbs', I still get out there every week with my family and would love to meet other parents who know the value of getting our kiddos outdoors. <br> <\/p>\n<p>The hikes are suited for caregivers who carry their children and for young children who toddle\/run on their own. No stroller hikes unless specified in the details of the hike. Please dress appropriately for the weather and terrain with layers, appropriate footwear, hats, sunscreen and water. Be prepared for ice, mud, scorching heat and\/or brisk winds! This is New England after all; though I don't expect them all in one hike.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We stroll at a slower pace to allow the children to soak up the environment, caregivers can chat with a new friend and we'll try to keep the group relatively close together. Our trail will be short and simple so you are free to take another loop around. Also, if your little one's pace is REALLY slow (I was once in that group) you can linger on the first trail in and we'll meet up with you on the way out.<br> <\/p>\n<p>Remember, we're kid friendly. We're all parents and caregivers doing our best to enjoy the outdoors with young children. The trails are selected for ease of walking and are short enough for the young ones to endure.&nbsp; We'll take breaks and spend plenty of time playing in leaves or snow, rolling over logs to check for bugs and skipping stones..... all things our kids should be doing and this is great place for it.<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

You can find out more about my business here at&nbsp;<a>www.mompreneursoul.com.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>A Little About My Background<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of my career I have noticed how most of my female peers, particularly mothers, were missing from top leadership positions across the corporate environment but were showing up in huge numbers as owners of small home based businesses. I began to question my own career and life decisions when I started a family and began to realize that there is far more to living a \"successful\" life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office, and that as a mother, that all came at a hefty price. In the midst of the American epidemic of career burnout, stress-related illnesses and erosion of family life, I started to question how mothers could be better supported in their struggle to allow both their business leadership and motherhood roles to coexist and simultaneously thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The result was years of doctoral research aimed at understanding the Mompreneur phenomenon, a recent societal trend where mothers are choosing to leave behind either a full time corporate career or a full time stay at home mom career for small business ownership. It became clear to me after years of interviews with mother-entrepreneurs across the country that these women were discovering a \u201cloophole\u201d to the mainstream career issues that plagued mothers for decades. Whether they had left behind a career as a corporate executive or they had been a stay at home mom for years and wanted to re-start a career, I noticed the common thread for these Mompreneur women was that they got what their soul was craving: the ability to simultaneously be a mom and have a career on their own terms, without sacrificing one for the other. These women confessed it wasn't an easy road to take, but at the end of the day they called the shots, they had more freedom to decide when they worked on the business or spending time with their children and they chose businesses that put their life passion and purpose at the center.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;My question then was how could I help power moms everywhere stuck in the fear and dysfunction of the mainstream career matrix successfully transition into entrepreneurship, and how could I help corporations who were losing these valuable savvy women leaders foster a healthier culture and environment to better retain and empower them. The answer to this question was the birth of Mompreneur Soul, a consulting firm aimed at nurturing a women\u2019s journey through motherhood and business leadership and entrepreneurship. My background includes being a mother, corporate executive, entrepreneur, business professor, certified career coach, and Kundalini yoga and meditation teacher, and my life work and passion is to revolutionize how our culture, our workplace and business leaders everywhere re-think motherhood and leadership, and how mothers can infuse soul into their families, careers and businesses.<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>","lon":-71.0500030518,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/highres_433857755.jpeg","photo_id":433857755,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/600_433857755.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/1\/9\/b\/thumb_433857755.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":11310777,"name":"Felicia Newhouse","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/highres_200641352.jpeg","photo_id":200641352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/member_200641352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/4\/8\/thumb_200641352.jpeg"}},"members":131,"name":"Mompreneur Soul Productive Playdates","id":18399943,"state":"MA","urlname":"MompreneurSoul","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":42.3600006104,"who":"Mompreneurs"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Peabody","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1422763042000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"socializing-for-40","name":"Socializing for 40+","id":16181},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"singles-friends-social-network-enjoying-life","name":"Singles, Friends, Social Network, Enjoying Life","id":23626}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/North-Shore-Fun-Friends-for-Women\/","rating":4.9,"description":"<p>This group is for fun, happy, women (40+) who would love to get out&nbsp;and expand their circle of friends.

There is nothing wrong with such groups and companies, but there is no need for another group to do the same &nbsp;as they do. &nbsp;The goal for this group to fill a different \"niche\", to be different from the others. &nbsp; <br><\/p>\n<p>The goal is for this group to be different in:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. Adventurous trips, whether in the U S or abroad. But that's not all we are, Some other groups do that, read on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. This is NOT a for-profit group. I, the founder and original organizer, am not seeking any compensation for trips or otherwise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. It is my concept that unlike some other groups, the \"organizer\" of a trip will not go for free, subsidized by increasing the costs of others. &nbsp;I do not criticize other groups that work that way, I have been on some wonderful trips with some, but I'm going to experiment with this group being different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. While the organizer of a trip will not go for free, it is my goal\/hope that many others who participate in an event will share the planning. Perhaps one person will investigate air fares, another where to stay, another what to do there, etc. Time will tell if this works out. The work to be done by any one person may be as minimal as making a phone call to an airline, calling a hostel, or a few minutes research on the internet. &nbsp;It's very little work if spread out, but a lot of work for one person to do by themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5. There is no minimal threshhold for how adventurous the trip will be. It may be to the wilds of Borneo or a weekend in Marthas Vineyard, biking and staying in a hostel. &nbsp;This is not MY group, it's OURS. Are you looking for someone, one person or more to accompany you on a standard-type cruise? A night at a concert? POST IT, become an event organizer, just contact me to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>6. In some situations we will be able to save our members a lot of money on great trips compared to other commercial companies and meetup groups. EXAMPLE: Machu Pichu (Peru). Typically, a trip there with a guide up the \"Inca Trail\" is advertised at about $1700 plus air fare. From my research, a gude must be a Peru-based licensed guiding company. Therefore someone here can only subcontract it out to a local guiding company. From my research, the best Peru-based guiding company is \"Llama Path\". They have almost 500 Trip Advisor reviews with an average 5 stars. I called them.

It is an inherently painful process that can lead to loneliness, isolation, fear, anger, depression and a myriad of difficult thoughts, emotions and situations. While these terrifying places can feel traumatic, they also CAN BE THE VERY SEEDS TO TRANSFORMATION: a more hopeful future, a healthier lifestyle, a happier family dynamic, and a more abundant YOU! This Meet Up group is about WELCOMING those contemplating, enduring and recovering from divorce in the Greater Boston community into a fellowship of support and engagement about how to make the best of what feels like the worst. There really is no other way! Together, we will look at common themes\/questions in topic focused gatherings through a lens of empowerment, such as: How can I channel my anger or other feelings in a way that won't hurt myself and those I love? How can I invest in myself and my future instead of being afraid of it? How can I protect the best interests of my children? How can I find new friends and build positive relationships in the midst of so much loss? How can I take care of my needs for intimacy and connection while still learning to take care of myself alone? &nbsp;How can I learn from the mistakes I contributed to my past relationship instead of denying them, beating myself up with them, and\/or bringing them with me into a new one? How can I cultivate respect and cooperation for my former partner who was part of so much hurt? In what ways is my divorce the loving choice? What\/Who is my divorce allowing and inviting myself to become that I felt I could not in the context of marriage? ... Through sharing our ideas around these questions with good doses of open mindedness, compassion and humor, we can be incredibly empowering companions to one another on this arduous journey. I am a divorce mentor, spiritual director\/companionship, former hospital chaplain, personal trainer, and published author. I am also a mother of two teens, and hope to bring both my skills and experience as offerings to the table of transformation, and expect that you will do just the same - not as experts, but as fellow human beings on similar journeys. This group is NOT a replacement for professional psychotherapeutic intervention, but a safe place for sharing our experiences and offering support to one another. &nbsp;Meetings will take place at welcoming, safe communal spaces. The format will be casual, hospitable, with a focus on offering true presence to one another through attentive listening and mindful sharing. Confidentiality will be honored. &nbsp;Many meetings will be limited in RSVP numbers not to exclude, but to keep the environment conducive to small group sharing. &nbsp;Guest speakers with expertise in related areas will present from time to time, and resources will be offered for you individual interests and wellness. &nbsp;If you are looking for an intimate community of companions to navigate your divorce journey for the best, then this group is for you!<\/p>","lon":-71.2399978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/c\/8\/highres_434491688.jpeg","photo_id":434491688,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/c\/8\/600_434491688.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/c\/8\/thumb_434491688.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":170540442,"name":"Gretchen","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/b\/highres_244494043.jpeg","photo_id":244494043,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/b\/member_244494043.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/d\/3\/1\/b\/thumb_244494043.jpeg"}},"members":192,"name":"Trauma to Transformation: Navigating Divorce for the Best","id":18448428,"state":"MA","urlname":"Trauma-to-Transformation-Navigating-Divorce-for-the-Best","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":42.2799987793,"who":"Companions on the Journey"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1424454469000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"livemusic","name":"Live Music","id":8652},{"urlkey":"dancing","name":"Dancing","id":17571},{"urlkey":"culture","name":"Culture","id":20169},{"urlkey":"learn-to-dance","name":"Learn to Dance","id":20509},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"learn-how-to-dance","name":"learn how to dance","id":37568}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Area-International-Dance-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"This is the activity for you if you enjoy movement and making friends!

Whether we like it or not, churches are pursuing our children. When my son\u2019s classmates talk about going to a church youth function and how much fun it was, he automatically wants to go and doesn\u2019t understand why we don\u2019t. Lets face it, churches do a lot of fun things with kids: lock-ins, parties, group games, ski trips, etc. When I was growing up, these things were the highlight of my youth. The church wants you to believe it\u2019s all the supernatural stuff that helps people, but the social benefits of belonging to a community is the real magic\u2014a magic we shouldn\u2019t let churches monopolize any longer.&nbsp;As a parent, I want my kids to have a safe place to explore their developing worlds view. A place where it\u2019s not just okay to ask questions, but encouraged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/indiegogo-media-prod-cld\/image\/upload\/c_limit,w_620\/v1433866240\/efjc3dy1qep9syy8ctq1.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>At Oasis, our Core Values are:<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>People are more important than beliefs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Reality is known through reason.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Meaning comes from making a difference.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Human hands solve human problems.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Be accepting and be accepted.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>For a long time, churches have had a virtual monopoly on the types of community that we see forming in groups like Oasis, Sunday Assembly, Humanist Hub, and others, each of which takes a slightly different approach so there is a group to fit the needs of any non-religious individual or family looking for&nbsp;that sense of community.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for Oasis \u2013 a well of compassion and reason where we can celebrate life&nbsp;and, together, make a difference.&nbsp;<b>A place where life is celebrated, family is&nbsp;valued, and all people matter.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Want an example of what an Oasis community looks like?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kansascity.com\/living\/star-magazine\/article5568999.html\">This article<\/a><span>&nbsp;in the Kansas City Star, profiling Kansas City Oasis, is a great example of what secular community can be, and what Boston Oasis will be aiming for.<\/span><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/indiegogo-media-prod-cld\/image\/upload\/c_limit,w_620\/v1433997127\/tjsrbnnw4b3gtqri3jrz.jpg\"><\/p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><b>The Impact<\/b><\/p>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Vibrant, tightly knit communities are central to human happiness and well-being; we are social creatures by nature.

The Oasis community model has produced thriving, successful, diverse communities in multiple cities across the nation and we are confident it will do so here as well. We have received, and will continue to receive, guidance from Oasis leaders who have built their own communities, as well as documented best-practices drawn from their experiences. From this foundation, Boston Oasis will develop into a unique iteration of this successful community model. Boston Oasis members will be free to suggest activities and events which are in keeping with the Oasis Core Values.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<br>\n<p><b>Where will Boston Oasis meet?<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>While the Sunday gatherings will take place in a consistent location to be determined, there are certainly some ideas on what kind of spaces we will be looking for. We will be looking for locations which are accessible by car and by public transportation. We will be looking for locations with available parking. We will be looking for locations with good accessibility.Furthermore, it is important to note that Oasis events outside the Sunday gatherings will take place across the area where our community resides. Neighborhood Potlucks, Meetings of Minds (discussion groups), Game Nights, social events... all of these can and will be scheduled throughout the Boston area, typically with several venues for a single event on a given night.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Want to volunteer?&nbsp; Visit our website and let us know you would like to help!<\/p>\n <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonoasis.org\/\">www.BostonOasis.org<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<br>\n<p><b>What is expected of members?<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Members are free to participate as much, or as little, as they want.

The SECOND SATURDAY of every month at 8:00PM we host a Ballroom Dance Party at our studio in Brighton.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>An intro lesson for those interested begins at 8:00PM and our dance party begins at 8:30PM. General Admission is $5\/person.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The address is: Star Dance Studio 323 Washington Street Brighton, MA Parking: There is some limited parking behind the studio, but that tends to fill up quickly! There is street parking however that is free after 6PM on Washington Street.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Feel free to contact the Admin with any questions or also the Star Dance School at info@StarDanceSchool.com or via phone at 617-202-9200. Don't forget to check out our ballroom dance social FAQ's below!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What is a \u201cBallroom Social\u201d?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>A ballroom social is a dance party featuring ballroom dance styles. Music is played for Standard and Smooth styles such as waltz, foxtrot, and tango as well as Latin and Rhythm styles including salsa, rumba, cha-cha, and the like. At Star Dance\u2019s Socials an optional 30 minute group dance lesson kicks off the evening as well!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What on earth should I wear?!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Smart-casual to elegant attire is encouraged, but most importantly wear clothing you can move around in comfortably. If you do not have ballroom shoes often a light weight dress shoe will do the trick. *Note: Please avoid sneakers, or metal spike-heel shoes as they can damage our floor. Thank you for your understanding!*&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Do I need a partner?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Partners are welcome, but not required to enjoy a night out on the town with us! Social dancing is a fantastic way to make new friends and we encourage dancers to rotate partners in order to meet new people.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Do I need prior dance experience?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Whether it is your first time dancing or you have years of ballroom under your belt, all levels are welcome to attend our socials!<br><\/span><\/p>","lon":-71.1200027466,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/7\/f\/highres_435816479.jpeg","photo_id":435816479,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/7\/f\/600_435816479.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/e\/7\/f\/thumb_435816479.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":185529939,"name":"Star Dance School","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/6\/highres_244809286.jpeg","photo_id":244809286,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/6\/member_244809286.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/4\/6\/thumb_244809286.jpeg"}},"members":269,"name":"Star Dance School Ballroom Meetup!","id":18518813,"state":"MA","urlname":"Star-Dance-School-Ballroom-Meetup","category":{"name":"dancing","id":5,"shortname":"dancing"},"lat":42.3499984741,"who":"Dancing Fools"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Boston","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1427240180000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"prodev","name":"Professional Development","id":3880},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"communityorg","name":"Community Organizations","id":10485},{"urlkey":"young-professionals","name":"Young Professionals","id":15231},{"urlkey":"career-network","name":"Career Network","id":15556},{"urlkey":"professional-networking","name":"Professional Networking","id":15720},{"urlkey":"volunteering","name":"Volunteering","id":16645},{"urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social","id":17201},{"urlkey":"community-building","name":"Community Building","id":20727},{"urlkey":"environmental-awareness","name":"Environmental Awareness","id":23842},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"boston","name":"Boston","id":31254},{"urlkey":"beach-cleanups","name":"Beach Cleanups","id":89637},{"urlkey":"graduate-students-and-young-professionals","name":"Graduate Students and Young Professionals","id":96823},{"urlkey":"networking-for-young-professionals","name":"Networking for Young Professionals","id":527162}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Boston-Emerging-Professionals-Group\/","rating":5,"description":"The Boston Harbor Association's emerging professionals group aims to connect and engage adults ages 21 to 35 with Boston Harbor and its waterfront and islands.
