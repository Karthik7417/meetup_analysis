Each session will end promptly at 8:30pm when the studio will go back into record mode for the evening schedule. Drop in at anytime up until 7:30pm during each session. Leave when you need! \u00a0 We listen to songs in the order members arrive so earlier is\u00a0usually better!<\/p> <p><br\/>The goal of the <b>Collective Song Club<\/b> is to create a nurturing space for songwriters, artists and producers to present their works in progress, completed songs and productions as well as ask questions about the music business. Vetting songs about to be recorded will give you one more moment of clarity and reflection before you spend energy and dollars on your recording. Song tempos and keys can be discussed as well as best possible producers and vocalists for your project. The studio will have guitars and a keyboard available so no need to feel you have to bring your own. The studio can playback a CD, your iPhone or Android, MP3 player, or connect via the internet to your website or Dropbox. Bring a few lyric sheets of the song you would like to share. The entire evening is about forming a creative community that enhances your art and helps you grow as a songwriter.<\/p> <p><br\/>There will be no advance payment or sign-up necessary. Each session will cost $20 per person payable at the door as we begin. The studio has a \u201cSquare\u201d reader so you can put it on your debit \/ credit card for $22 with the additional sum to cover the handling charge. Come one week or skip a session - feeling inspired - come on down - feeling tired or have a change of plans - there\u2019s no need to feel like you have to be there. Sessions might be crowded - some might be just a few people - or you!<\/p> <p>All MeetUp group members may attend a first Song Club session without having to become a full Collective member. After your first session the Collective requires that you become a full member of the Collective. The annual membership fee is only $35.

At the very least, vegans shouldn't have to stress out about what to order and should be able to go to restaurants with the peace of mind knowing there are clearly marked vegan options so they don't have to ask the waiter a million questions in front of their friends...we've all been there. Thus, the more people who show up to this event, the more likely we are to make some progress in this regard!<\/p> <p><br\/>So come on out for some delicious food, great company, and some subtle activism!<\/p> <p><br\/>Also, this event is open to vegans, vegetarians, pescetarians, veg-curious, omnivores, carnivores, etc! In fact, we encourage you to invite your non vegan friends! However, please order vegan at the restaurant and encourage anyone who may not be vegan to do so as well.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Come inside the restaurant and we will be at the tables holding a \"meetup\" sign.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/V-Rock\/events\/228298933\/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":7200000,"name":"Vegan Dinner at Satay Malaysian Cuisine","id":"228298933","time":1455750000000,"updated":1455758634000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1304365247000,"name":"V Rock!

And, a concluding slide-full of \"asks!\" But, my first objective was to interest NYU-Tandon in hosting our physical HML prototype space. In exchange for a novel, turnkey Lab replete with major players, mentors, trainers, lecturers and eTinkers---with strategic Healthcare\u00a0disciplines, innovations, equipment\u00a0and an accelerator---open to his Tandon community.<\/p> <p>I think that a Higher Ed Institution (HEI) is a natural venue-partner for our HML prototype.

Yep, I'm addressing those of you---among our 200 members---who have yet to get personally involved since you \"signed up\" here with \"HCx3DP Meetup NY.\"\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>This is still our official name...even though we've invested the last seven or eight months in a key, innovative subset of \"HCx3DP...\" That is \"Health Maker Lab\"---HML, for short.<\/b><\/p> <p>Bear with me! In this update,\u00a0I'm going to present additional (compelling!!) reasons for you to commit more of your time and attention to HML. I think in many cases, your free-will commitment likely comes down---in the main---to the appeal of our evolving strategies. And, how---despite\u00a0this world full of so much choice---they complement your own interests .<\/p> <p>Fair enough. Since some of you joined our Meetup Community, we HAVE changed our targets and readjusted our focus. Health Maker Lab is BOTH broader and narrower than HCx3DP.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Broader in that we've expanded \"3DP\" to Digital Fabrication---or, DigiFab. You know as well as I that tech of every kind is evolving at lightning speed. 3D Printing is an important subset of DigiFab---especially when applied to Healthcare solutions. BUT, there are effective ways and means beyond 3DP to deliver those novel and necessary answers. Especially if we're thinking \"Big Tent.\"<\/p> <p>Narrower in that we've\u00a0drilling down to determine the most effective of our ultimate HML solutions. Those solutions that will best meet the needs of specific patient, client or recipient communities for improved health---in a larger compass of that phrase. From our HML Community to the larger local community by narrowing our \"envisioning\" to integrate appropriate solutions. Even if they are NOT the traditional modes of \"modern\" medicine.<\/p> <p><b><i>Big Tent---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Now---as this post's title suggests---our HML operational strategy includes putting up a Big Tent and inviting disparate interests (yours!) to enter in expectation and join in our convocation successfully. At this point, we will be hard put to keep our internal HML Action Centers to eight or 10. And, to address the needs of \"only\" five or six external neighborhood partner or player populations.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Internally, diverse Action Centers will promote the cross-pollination of new and novel ideas. Leading to what we hope are effective hybrid solutions in Healthcare.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Externally, serving the varied needs of sometimes competing neighborhood interest groups and organizations (\"Hood Hubs!\") WILL add to the complexity of our interfaces, relationships and connections. Human interactions ARE usually \"messy.\" (As Miss Frizzle of \"The Magic School Bus\" admonishes those who would produce scientific creativity: \"Take chances; make mistakes; get messy.\") We will have to inform our out-facing perspectives with common-good POVs commonly shared.<\/p> <p><b><i>GeoPrint---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Our HML \"action footprint\" on the maps of our overlapping communities---our GeoPrint---are likely to be rather fluid. Especially to start. The interests of our HML Community, donors and partners and Healthcare recipients will ensure some curious GeoPrint \"gerrymandering.\" At least until we can rationalize our efforts---from (eventually) adequate resources.<\/p> <p>Our startup GeoPrint will (likely!) center in Brooklyn---the \"Techreative\" Borough. Our initial home-base will (likely!) reside in the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT). That's DUMBO (the City's official \"Digital District\"), the Brooklyn Navy Yard (335 tech-driven startups and ramp-ups) and Downtown Brooklyn (14 higher ed institutions and 60K students). A rich stew of assets that will help us to launch successfully. (I've lived and worked in Brooklyn for over 35 years and I can vouch for its base of resources---in our pursuit of a new kind of Health.)\u00a0<\/p> <p>From the BTT, we'll (likely!) spread in Brownstone and Riparian (East River) BK and east into UltraUrban East New York and Brownsville. Neighborhoods of high health needs. NYC enjoys 55 major Healthcare facilities. The self-selected among these will act as our first\u00a0Hood Hubs\u00a0among equals. We are---after all---focused on Health and hospitals strive to deliver that uncommon commodity.<\/p> <p>Donors and partners---action resources---may drive the expansion of our GeoPrint in unpredictable directions. It is possible that interested players in northern New Jersey could influence our development there---before, say, The Bronx or Staten Island. Certainly, the TriState Region is a natural GeoPrint extension for HML. After that...the world?!!<\/p> <p><b><i>Viral Ecosystem---<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>Health Maker Lab is intent on prototyping its inspirations, ideas and innovations in an initial \"sandbox\" location. We'll play with the combinations that fascinate and foster the most promising solutions to diverse needs. The most \u00a0certain possibilities are the certainty of the unexpected.\u00a0<\/p> <p>As an antidote to negative results, we will call on our Advisory Council (eventually 15 in number) of proven players. These advisors---the bases for our Action Centers---will keep us progressing appropriately to a stable ecosystem at our first HML location.<\/p> <p>At that breakout point, we envision a kind of viral HML \"reproduction\" regimen will commence. Successful ways and means, models and modes and---most importantly---trained and experienced cadre will empower rapid growth (likely?) within New York City.<\/p> <p><b>+++<\/b><\/p> <p>These expectations will indeed require good people to achieve.

In this talk, we'll hear from a LISP expert about some advanced uses of objects and discuss how to best support the features in OCaml.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Talk:<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>We first briefly consider metaprogramming and describe what macros are, how they work, how to write them correctly and when to use them.<\/p> <p>Metaclasses are described next along with what they are used for and can accomplish. A specific use-case will be examined in depth. This is done in the context of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). We also examine true multiple inheritance and how it affects method dispatching and method combination.<\/p> <p>The remainder of the talk focuses on Metaobject protocols and describes the problems that MOPs were designed to solve. We look at how to design and implement a metaobject protocol for CLOS and specifically examine code that implements the 'defclass' macro which is CLOS's class definition mechanism. We then extend the implementation to support metaobject protocol functionality.<\/p> <p>No prior knowledge of Lisp or CLOS will be assumed and the presentation is expected to be self-contained.<\/p> <p>The material covered in this talk will mostly be drawn from the following three books: \"On Lisp\" by Paul Graham, \"Common Lisp the Language\" by Guy Steele and\u00a0 The \"Art of the Metaobject Protocol\" by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres and Daniel G.

Your welcome to join us at one of free public seminars!<\/p> <p>Have you ever had a vivid flying dream? How about the sensation of floating while falling asleep or meditating? How about the perception of \u201cdropping\u201d back into your body just before waking up? If so it may be possible that you have experienced what is called an out-of-body experience. It has sometimes been known in various spiritual traditions and schools of thought in history, as \u201castral projection\u201d or \u201csoul travel\u201d.<\/p> <p>Despite being considered by many to be a strange or obscure topic, the experience has been reported for thousands of years by people all over the world, often mixed up with dreams. Throughout history people have reported \u201cotherworldly\u201d journeys and spiritual experiences into other dimensions in a variety of settings - during spiritual practices (i.e meditation, prayer, etc), near-death, during sleep or spontaneously during the day. What is interesting is that unbeknownst to most of the public, is that the out-of-body experience is a powerful tool for self-transformation, self-discovery and wellness and can be willfully induced, developed, controlled and utilized to greatly benefit yourself and others. The experience is much like the altered states of consciousness that shamans and medicine men in history used to connect with the psychic world, obtain knowledge, heal others, etc.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/8\/4\/0\/600_439011264.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>This short seminar is offered freely to the public and will provide you with cutting edge information on out-of-body experiences (i.e. astral projection, soul travel, etc), subtle energy, non-physical dimensions and related topics. Cutting through misconceptions and misinformation about the topic, you will learn about the latest research on these experiences, including their benefits (see below) and \u2013 unbeknownst to most of us \u2013 how they already affect our daily life yet have huge implications about who you are and your life purpose.<br\/>Some of the benefits of the out-of-body experience are:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Understanding non-physical dimensions or realities<br\/>\u2022 Direct contact with spirit guides<br\/>\u2022 Development of psychic abilities<br\/>\u2022 Losing the fear of death<br\/>\u2022 Getting information about your life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Using OBEs as a tool to assist or heal others<br\/>\u2022 Psychic awareness and protection<br\/>\u2022 Development of universalism and fraternity<\/p> <p>In addition to these benefits, these additional fascinating topics will be discussed at the lecture:<\/p> <p>\u2022 Our multidimensional nature<br\/>\u2022 How the OBE experience (i.e astral projection, etc) works<br\/>\u2022 How an OBE is experienced first hand<br\/>\u2022 Astral projection tips, benefits &amp; utilities<br\/>\u2022 How to use the OBE to discover our life purpose<br\/>\u2022 Psychic abilities related to the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Our multiple subtle bodies and their function<br\/>\u2022 What current research tells us about the OBE<br\/>\u2022 Overview of easy out-of-body experience techniques<br\/>\u2022 Non physical dimensions<br\/>\u2022 What happens psychically at night<br\/>\u2022 Information about IAC\u2019s OBE and psychic training programs<br\/>\u2022 Answers to questions you have about these topics or your experiences<\/p> <p>Is this lecture right for you?<\/p> <p>This lecture is packed with fascinating information and is interesting to both those new to the topic, or those already quite knowledgeable about it. Whether you\u2019re just curious about the topic, want to ask about an experience you had, or what to go deeper, this lecture is for you. It is well suited for anyone planning on further study but still looking for a rational, integrated overview of these frequently misunderstood topics.<\/p> <p>If you are interested in IAC\u2019s other programs, note that this free lecture is an ideal (although optional) starting point for people interested in taking IAC\u2019s other courses. It allows would-be students to make a personal connection with our instructors and team, obtaining confidence in our knowledge, approach, and framework. This lecture also introduces our organization, and gives an overview of our curriculum, programs, and publications. Hence it is a great opportunity to ask an instructor about IAC's main OBE training course, the award-winning Consciousness Development Program (CDP), which we offer regularly in New York.<\/p> <p>Who teaches this free lecture?\u00a0<\/p> <p>It is taught by one of IAC\u2019s senior faculty members, depending on who\u2019s available. IAC\u2019s faculty members have years of experience and training in spirituality and consciousness studies, including out-of-body experiences and psychic phenomena. IAC is an educational and research centered organization in the area of consciousness studies, human potential and psychic development, and has offices in over 12 countries worldwide.<\/p> <p>How do I attend?<\/p> <p>Confirm via meetup that you're attending or email us to register at newyork (-at-) iacworld.org<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"59th and Lex subway is closest.

But has the drive for cultural fit gone rogue? Has it shifted into a different kind of pursuit? Are talent managers actually hiring based on a series of values and beliefs, or just hiring based on who they\u2019d like to hang out with? And how do you tell the difference?<\/p> <p>According to a May 2013 article in Harvard Business Review,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2013\/05\/creating-the-best-workplace-on-earth\">Creating the Best Workplace On Earth<\/a>, \u201cAchieving the full benefit of diversity means trading the comfort of being surrounded by kindred spirits for the hard work of fitting various kinds of people, work habits, and thought traditions into a vibrant culture. Managers must continually work out when to forge ahead and when to take the time to discuss and compromise.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>We\u2019ll hear from discussion leaders about the difference between hiring for cultural fit versus hiring for \u201ccultural add\u201d (meaning people who add to the current cultural mix and enhance the organization).

Legal Hackers Jam Sessions are monthly small-group working sessions that are geared to address specific problems in a quick-sprint, collaborative environment. Jam Sessions will differ from our regular panel events in two ways: (1) smaller group size, and (2) more interactivity--bring your laptops and other small computing devices. One LH member will lead each Jam Session by posing a problem, with background, relevant to the Legal Hackers community, perhaps in connection with a personal project, perhaps soliciting support for a group project. From there, we will do our best to pose a real solution to the problems presented in a 2-3 hour sprint. We will hope to continue checking in on Jam Session leaders on a regular basis to see progress with time and offer additional support.<\/p> <p>Important things to note: Unfortunately, we will have to strictly enforce the RSVP list because space is very limited. Also, as with all our events (other than hackathons), any actual software or tangible resources should be contributed to the group on a Creative Commons or Open Source basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Our second Jam Session will be led by Phil Weiss.

Winegrowers experimented with nontraditional French varietals.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll be trying a very unusual local grape that has been saved from extinction\u2014the little-known Sumoll.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Costers del Segre (Catalonia):<\/i>\u00a0 This is Catalonia\u2019s most inland wine region\u2014a harsh, semi-arid region that is isolated from Mediterranean influences. Irrigation here is essential. The cooler regions produce grapes for Cava (Parellada, Macabeo, Xarel-lo), and the warmer areas are suitable for red grapes (Tempranillo, Garnacha). \u00a0And Costers del Segre was the first Catalan region to authorize the use of international varieties in DO wines, such as Cabernet and Pinot Noir.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying a Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that was fermented in an ancient manner\u2014in stone troughs called <i>lagars.<\/i> \u00a0(I tried this winemaker\u2019s Syrah at a wine bar in Girona\u2014maybe the best \u20ac6 glass of wine I\u2019ve ever had.)<\/p> <p><i>Utiel-Requena (Valencia):<\/i>\u00a0 Proceeding about 250 km down the coast, the next wine region you encounter is Valencia.\u00a0 Utiel-Requena, a flat, dry plateau situated 70 km inland, is Valencia\u2019s largest subregion, long known for bulk wine production using the prolific, heat-tolerant Bobal grape.\u00a0 But as is happening in many wine regions around the world, ambitious new producers are focusing on quality winemaking, elevating the reputation of a little-known region and grape.\u00a0 Bobal is deeply colored and tannic, but the tannins are countered by bright acidity, making it a refreshing food wine.\u00a0 The Bobals I tried in Valencia were among the most interesting wine discoveries of my trip.\u00a0<\/p> <p><i>Bullas (Murcia):<\/i>\u00a0 Further down the coast, Bullas is another hot, dry plateau that straddles the line between Mediterranean climate and the hot summer\/cold winter pattern of a continental region.\u00a0 Monastrell is the signature grape here, a dark, thick-skinned variety that can have savory, smoky, meaty aromas and flavors.\u00a0 The wines have traditionally been drunk young, but more ambitious producers make ageworthy examples matured in oak.\u00a0 We will be trying an oak-aged Bullas Monastrell\/Syrah blend made by Norrell Robertson, a Master of Wine and the <i>escoc\u00e9s volante<\/i> (flying Scotsman) of the wine\u2019s name.\u00a0 A 2009 vintage, this sturdy wine still retains its youth.<\/p> <p><i>M\u00e1laga:<\/i>\u00a0 This is a heavily tourism-dependent region on the Mediterranean coast of Andaluc\u00eda where the signature wines are sweet Moscatel and fortified Pedro Xim\u00e9nez.\u00a0 Dry table wines are produced, but it can be a challenge to find them.\u00a0 This may be the only wine region I\u2019ve ever visited where the local wines are not actively promoted.\u00a0 In M\u00e1laga and Marbella, I\u2019d inquire about local wines, and I\u2019d almost invariably be steered toward a Rioja, Rueda, or Ribera del Duero.\u00a0 But they do make some good stuff\u2014I had a Serrania de Ronda Cabernet Sauvignon that was almost as remarkable at the view from my lunch table.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be trying two dry wines from M\u00e1laga, a dry Muscat from famed sweet wine maker Jorge Ordo\u00f1ez and an oak-aged red blend that is mostly old-vines Garnacha and includes the rare, local Rom\u00e9 grape.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/8\/f\/2\/600_446466386.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>We\u2019ll be meeting back at old reliable Harper\u2019s in Dobbs Ferry.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/harpersonmain.com\"><a href=\"http:\/\/harpersonmain.com\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/harpersonmain.com<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><b>2009 Vinyes dels Aspres Blanc dels Aspres\u00a0 (Empord\u00e0, Catalonia)\u00a0 $10 (Zachy\u2019s sale; reg. price $28)\u00a0 \u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Jancis Robinson 16.5\/20<\/i> \u2013 Grenache Blanc.

Vinified totally dry, it is a riveting, perfumed, flowery white exhibiting notes of melons, honeysuckle and tropical fruits in a light-bodied, zesty, naked style. There are 5,000 cases of this cuv\u00e9e, which for ten years has been a reference point for what can be accomplished with this grape in terms of making dry wines versus the sweeter wines for which this area is famous.<\/p> <p><b>2011 Pardas Collita Roja (Pened\u00e8s, Catalonia)\u00a0 $33\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The 2011 Collita Roja is produced from Sumoll grapes from a single vineyard of 0.72 hectares in St. Llorenc d'Hortons on chalky soils, planted in 1949. The wine has a bright ruby color and a shiny nose of bright red fruits intermixed with strong balsamic aromas of wild herbs, intensely Mediterranean with lots of character, and a tasty, light to medium-bodied palate with piercing licorice and ripe fruit flavors that transport you to a Mediterranean forest. With time, more continental and Atlantic notes develop in the glass, which give the wine more depth and complexity. I loved it. Drink now-2020.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Castell d'Encus Quest\u00a0 (Costers del Segre, Catalonia)\u00a0 $58\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 92<\/i> \u2013 (70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot; fermented in stone <i>lagars<\/i> and aged in 70% new French oak for 15 months.) \u00a0Bright violet color. \u00a0Mineral-accented cherry and blackcurrant on the intensely perfumed nose and in the mouth. \u00a0Shows excellent clarity and power, picking up smoke and peppery spice nuances with aeration. \u00a0Closes smoky, stony, and very long, with supple tannins building slowly and fading into the wine's intense fruit.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Viticultores San Juan Bobal deSanjuan (Utiel-Requena, Valencia)\u00a0 $17\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Tanzer 90<\/i> \u2013\u00a0 (Made from vines between 60 and 80 years of age; aged for four months in concrete tanks.)\u00a0 Bright purple.\u00a0 Exotic scents of blackberry, blueberry and Indian spices, with cola and violet accents.\u00a0 Broad and supple but lively too, with a silky texture and deep, sweet dark berry preserve flavors.\u00a0 Finishes with a sappy, persistent note of boysenberry, a zesty touch of minerality and harmonious tannins. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>2009 Escoces Volante 3000 A\u00f1os (Bullas, Murcia)\u00a0 $20 (from Wines Till Sold Out; release price $50)<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 93<\/i> \u2013 The superb[masked] A\u00f1os, which is a 50\/50 blend of old-vine Monastrell and 15-year-old Syrah from Bullas, has good meatiness, notes of ginger and plums, hints of violets and is overall a serious red. The palate is medium to full-bodied with the rusticity of Monastrell and the more sophisticated texture of the Syrah. It\u2019s a serious Mediterranean blend showing the character of the place and preserving the freshness and acidity in a nice, drinkable way.<\/p> <p><b>2012 Sedella Laderas de Sedella\u00a0 (M\u00e1laga)\u00a0 $18\u00a0 <\/b><\/p> <p><i>Wine Advocate 91<\/i> \u2013 In 2008, Lauren Rosillo planted 0.9 hectares with the same field-blend found in the original Sedella vineyard: Rom\u00e9, Garnacha, Ja\u00e9n (Menc\u00eda), (white) Montua and Moscatel Romano. He tried to replicate the old vineyard as much as possible on this plot located at 800 meters on a north-facing slope on slate soils. This first 2012 Laderas de Sedella also followed a very similar process, with all the grapes harvested and fermented together in stainless steel. But in this case, malolactic fermentation was carried out in a combination of oak and cement amphorae where the wine matured for 12 months without racking. The nose is a combination of flowers, Mediterranean herbs, pollen, beeswax and red berries. The palate is medium-bodied, with great acidity, very tasty, elegant, and with very fine-grained tannins. Great value. 1,912 bottles produced.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group\/events\/228526675\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Mediterranean Spain","id":"228526675","time":1455753600000,"updated":1455833039000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1403902580000,"name":"Westchester BYOB Wine Tasting Group","group_lon":-73.8600006104,"id":15362102,"urlname":"Westchester-BYOB-Wine-Tasting-Group","group_lat":41.0800018311,"who":"wine lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"394 Broadway, 6th floor,10013","name":"ODSC Office","lon":-74.002274,"id":24361576,"state":"NY","lat":40.718292,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":150,"headcount":0,"distance":2.28784441948,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455202739000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/0\/1\/600_442085121.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b><i>#ODSC meetup group\u00a0is co-hosting this event with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nycpython\/\">The New York Python Meetup Group<\/a>.<br\/><\/i><\/b><\/p> <p><b><i>Enabling Python a Become a Better Big Data Citizen - Wes McKinney<\/i><\/b><\/p> <p>The Python ecosystem has long struggled with interoperability with the Apache Hadoop and Spark ecosystems due to architectural issues around JVM-Python interoperability and the high cost of moving data between processes.

Seasoned players with erratic schedules can easily hop in and out of Encounters; unlike a traditional campaign, DMs and players will rotate, resulting in a dynamic game experience. We are using the latest edition of D&amp;D (5e) and each session lasts about 3-4 hours, easily fitting into your work or school schedule, and presents a new and exciting challenge each week. The $10 fee covers your use of the playspace, though committing to 10 weeks grants the player a discount.<\/p> <p><br\/>We're always on the lookout for DM talent for this season-- volunteers keep programs like this one alive! However, more important than veteran DMs, Encounters is a place where even new players should feel comfortable testing out the DMing waters. Every Saturday we provide our DMs with that week's \"adventure chunk\", a set of 2-3 encounters in one simple, easy-to-read packet. This bite-sized DMing format is ideal for new DMs and veterans who don't have the time to create an entire campaign from scratch, and allow lots of room for alterations and improvisations as the DM sees fit. DMs who volunteer their time do not pay the $10 fee, and receive a steep discount on our D&amp;D related products.<\/p> <p><br\/>For our first session, we will be creating level 1 characters and running a brief \"test run\" of our new adventurers as they get their footing the world of the Forgotten Realms.

The richness and emotional impact of ''ABC Africa'' comes partly from the balance it achieves between the director's personality (he appears occasionally, middle-aged, wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses and rarely without a camera) and his vast, terrible subject. He never pretends to have mastered the subject -- the film's title suggests the elementary state of his knowledge -- or to be able to solve Uganda's problems by observing them.

We will study that ancient hermetic formula that Hermes trismegistus left for us to ponder about in his emerald tablet; \"As above, so below.\" We will explore the interconnectedness that we all share, as well as methods to feel part of that \"oneness\" that all spiritual Masters tell us about.<\/p> <p>***Our lecture will be followed by with a guided meditation.<\/p> <p>***Door close at 8:45pm.

The viewer is often unable to see the whole object. The subject of the photo is often only a small part of the idea of the image. Viewers may only know the essence of the image subject or understand it by what is implied. Often the image will not be a literal view of the subject itself.<\/p> <p><br\/>In abstract photography there are dimensions rarely seen in other media. For example, Focus can add to the conceptual feel of abstracts by isolating parts of the subject through the use of blur. For the viewer, abstract photography is not about knowing and recognizing the subject.

Older solutions have created a gap, making it challenging for the traditional enterprise to be able to bridge and embrace the new world of cloud infrastructure, virtualization and containers. By accepting the happy medium of a hybrid cloud, Arista\u2019s EOS and CloudVision unify migrating workloads to a hybrid cloud model. Enterprise customers can now embrace cloud scale economics, and not only drive down the cost of running the infrastructure, but empower the business to be more agile in an ever-demanding suite of applications from on-premise to off-premise cloudscapes.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The key migration options are:\u00a0<\/p> <p>1. Workload Identification \u2013 Identify which workloads to migrate, and when to migrate them.<br\/>2. Migration Path \u2013 Help with the seamless migration of the workloads from private to public cloud.<br\/>3. Cloud Telemetry \u2013 Help provide workflow visibility once the workloads have been migrated.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Join Arista for this deep dive into the Hybrid Cloud, and what it can do for your organization.

Over the years Nino has culled a large, loyal following with his magnetic personality. His upscale restaurants feature extravagant dishes, fresh seafood, homemade pastas, table side cooking and live music. Past guests have included: Hilary Duff, Carol Burnett, Tony Bennett, Clint Eastwood, Angela Lansbury, Regis Philbin, Chelsea Clinton, and members of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d-James Gandolfini, Tony Sirico, Vince Pastore and Dominic Chianese. Nino Selimaj is also beloved by the media. His name and his restaurants often appear in the gossip columns. In addition, Selimaj regularly appears on TV preparing some of his favorite recipes. Nino considers his restaurants an extension of his home and all his patrons are treated like the most royal of guests. He is very excited to welcome our group for the first time to his establishment.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup\/events\/228043167\/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Nino's  Restaurant","id":"228043167","time":1455835500000,"updated":1455848183000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431373701000,"name":"Over 45+ New York Dinner Meetup","group_lon":-74,"id":18590381,"urlname":"Over-45-New-York-Dinner-Meetup","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":22.7179489136,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441139752000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The adventure continues.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/CNJDND\/events\/227634625\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":14400000,"name":"The As Yet Unnamed Campaign of Increasingly Poor Decisions","id":"mxtkklyvdbxb","time":1455836400000,"updated":1455855746000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421796053000,"name":"Central Jersey Dungeons & Dragons","group_lon":-74.3600006104,"id":18359548,"urlname":"CNJDND","group_lat":40.5800018311,"who":"Adventurers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07033","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Kenilworth","address_1":"14 Michigan Avenue","name":"Wildpig Comics","lon":-74.286171,"id":16236662,"state":"NJ","lat":40.676754,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":16.3489341736,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454532857000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>*THIS GROUP HAS ALREADY REACHED ITS PLAYER LIMIT.*<br\/>In the bitter cold of a land mired in eternal winter, hunters take the shape of wolves to better kill their prey.

But so is writing software that can be enhanced and extended. It\u2019s become quite commonplace for many apps today to expose APIs so externally written apps can have access to their data or their services. But imagine how cool it is to expose an API for changing or extending an application\u2019s functionality. I\u2019m talking about the ability to use the architecture of an application in order to enhance that system. This is the power of the patterns and techniques I\u2019m going to show you in this session. They\u2019re very useful and very geeky so bring your propeller hat.<\/p> <p><b>About Miguel Castro:<\/b><\/p> <p>Whether playing on the local Radio Shack\u2019s TRS-80 or designing systems for clients around the globe, Miguel has been writing software since he was 12 years old. He insists on staying heavily involved and up-to-date on all aspects of software application design &amp; development, and projects that diversity onto the type of training and consulting he provides to his customers and believes that it\u2019s never just about understanding the technologies, but how technologies work together. In fact, it is on this concept that Miguel based two of his Pluralsight courses, Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications, which was #1 for several weeks, and Developing Extensible Sotware. Miguel is a Microsoft MVP since 2005 and when he\u2019s not consulting or training, Miguel speaks at conferences around the world, practices combining on-stage tech and comedy, and never misses a Formula 1 race. But best of all, he\u2019s the proud father of a very tech-savvy 10 year old girl, and a proud husband to the woman that homeschools her.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-NET-Developers\/events\/228422090\/","yes_rsvp_count":75,"name":"Exposing an Extensibility API for your Applications (Miguel Castro)","id":"228422090","time":1455836400000,"updated":1455904524000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1452042430000,"name":"NYC .NET Developers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19285838,"urlname":"NYC-NET-Developers","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"28 West 23rd Street, 4th floor","name":"AppNexus","lon":-73.99099,"id":24369344,"state":"NY","lat":40.741627,"repinned":false},"headcount":130,"distance":0.582077801228,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453907017000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey Latin@ Techies!<\/p> <p>To kick off 2016, we're proud to host our 3rd Startup Pitch Night with AppNexus on Thursday 2\/18 - 6pm @ AppNexus, 28 West 23rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10010.<\/p> <p><b>To apply to pitch please sign up <a href=\"http:\/\/ow.ly\/R670G\">here<\/a><\/b> (feel free to forward along to anyone who may be interested).<\/p> <p>Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e7cbMOZ7fXo&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;autohide=1&amp;egm=0&amp;hd=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\">video<\/a> of one of our past pitch competitions - in case you didn\u2019t know how awesome they are.<\/p> <p><b>This event will sell out and space is limited so please RSVP <a href=\"https:\/\/latinotech3.splashthat.com\/\">HERE<\/a><\/b><\/p> <p>RSVPs on this meetup group will NOT count.<\/p> <p>Thanks to all of you that have already applied to pitch.

His work is often highly saturated, smooth lines of color layering and surrounding one another in fractured views of the world. Vivid pigments layer over one another to create compositions that render architecture in vivid orange and silver, or trees in crisp red in front of soft blocks of green to build the silhouettes of city buildings. Borovyk's paintings have a quality like woodblock: small, sharp strokes interfere with portions of color unexpectedly as planes of pigment mingle and, at the same time, are sharply delineated. Selectively thick brushstrokes or cork board shapes interfere with this flat, faceted, and imaginative use of color. \"I do not create art unless it creates itself as I work,\" Borovyk says. For him, the work in a way creates itself, both as he paints or sculpts and as viewers return again and again with new interpretations.<\/p> <p>Growing up in Lviv, Ukraine, Taras Borovyk was surrounded by Austrian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian architecture and art, influences of which can be found in his bold hues and eye for architecture.<\/p> <p>Reception: Thursday February 18,[masked] PM,<br\/>includes vine and snacks.<\/p> <p>Event is free.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Russian-Brooklyn\/events\/228692664\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"duration":7200000,"name":"Agora Gallery","id":"228692664","time":1455836400000,"updated":1455856389000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1149110392000,"name":"The 4th Ave Brooklyn Russian Language Meetup Group","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":255797,"urlname":"Russian-Brooklyn","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Russian Speakers in Brooklyn"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07054","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Parsippany","address_1":"Parsippany Blvd","name":"Embassy Suites Hotel","lon":-74.421699,"id":758436,"state":"NJ","lat":40.870585,"repinned":false},"headcount":10,"distance":24.1133060455,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452204642000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>You are invited to attend our gathering of QuickBooks ProAdvisors, Consultants, Accountants, and IT Professionals.<\/p> <p>Our goal is to learn from each other, better service our clients with more solutions and have some fun along the way.\u00a0<\/p> <p>This month will feature a presentation on the\u00a0<b><i>Profit First<\/i><\/b>\u00a0method of cash management, by member Karen Dellaripa.

The benefits are astounding! Sharing your core truth and living your purpose is deeply pleasurable and incredibly satisfying. Most women are blocked from accessing her core power, her true awareness of self. Soul Therapy is an evolutionary embodiment of exploring your humanness from the SOUL level.<\/p> <p>During our time together you will be asked five questions that will lead you into greater awareness of who you are, why you get stuck, what your soul wants to communicate to you, how to manifest your dreams and how to love yourself. If you have ever wanted to tap into your unlimited potentiality and be happy in the flow of life with less stress, now is the time to do so.<\/p> <p>Your soul is the guardian and gatekeeper to your true self. Your authentic voice is the one main requirement that resides within you and provides ample opportunities for you to listen, grow and expand. Most people don\u2019t know how to listen or understand how to embrace your soul\u2019s wisdom and knowledge.

In the\u00a0middle of that awesome visualization I felt a burst, a huge leap of energy expanding in my heart chakra (and since I am an energy healer it makes so much sense). Ayelet gave me a major breakthrough! I will be using the techniques we were taught to bring forth all this new power I have. I now feel as though this power is already here and now fully available to me, and I will use it to melt away my hesitation, doubts and fears. I can feel at ease knowing I have this new tool in my hands, it's as though I am warping time to manifest the best version of who I will become.\u00a0Thank you Ayelet!\" -Ricardo, New Jersey\u00a0<\/p> <p>\"I listened to your webinar today from the UK and\u00a0I wanted to first thank you for hosting this. I have been doing a lot of things, such as the law of attraction, access consciousness, and yoga, and I must say that I love the way you broke it down! I've done all this reading \/ learning and no one does it your way. I love how you said to write down all your thoughts\/ lists about yourself, as well as goals, to see where the conflicts lie. I haven't really come across anyone who breaks it up into mini pieces that make sense. Normally I'm left confused, everyone [else] guides you with what to do, they just don't explain how to do it.\u00a0Again thank you so much.\" -\u00a0Natasha, U.K.<\/p> <p>\"I met Ayelet at a free Lust to Love Meditation that she was leading. It was a very transformative experience. I didn't know what to expect. Well, less than ten minutes in\u00a0I started crying and I didn't know how to stop. The tears just kept flowing. By the end of it, I felt like I let go of my anxiety and my fears of never being good enough.<\/p> <p>Ayelet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron\">www.Facebook.com\/Ayelet.Shimron<\/a>) is a relationship expert. I asked for her advice regarding my recent breakup with my boyfriend of six years, which is why I went to her event. Ayelet explained that we have a tendency to constantly chase guys who don't treat us right, and we have expectations of other people that in turn, create unhappiness in our lives. Working on the root chakra helps us let go of those expectations and find inner peace.<\/p> <p>The meditation event helped me get through my break up immensely, and not only that, I fixed my constantly dysfunctional relationship with my parents as well. I feel like I've become more confident and let go of many of my fears.<\/p> <p>Ayelet is definitely an authentic and go-to person when it comes to improving relationships. The free meditation she led was life changing for me.\"- Annie Yang, NYC<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Life-Transformers\/events\/228589060\/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":7200000,"name":"The Ultimate Technique for Removing Doubt & Breaking Habits","id":"228589060","time":1455838200000,"updated":1455908302000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1337054153000,"name":"Transform Your Life: ATTRACT Goals, Relationships, SUCCESS","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":3867642,"urlname":"The-Life-Transformers","group_lat":40.8499984741,"who":"The Life Transformers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10034","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"330 West 40th street, (between 8th and 9th avenue)","name":"Skyroom Rooftop","lon":-73.918007,"id":2683201,"state":"NY","lat":40.862411,"repinned":false},"headcount":200,"distance":8.64890575409,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455501080000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Join us for the best fashion social of 2016 <\/b><\/p> <p>*Live Fashion Show starts around 9:30PM<\/p> <p>*Social Networking followed by a live fashion show<\/p> <p>*Drink Specials from 5-7PM<\/p> <p>*DJ Spinning from 7 to 11PM<\/p> <p>*Cash Bar all night and great food available for purchase<\/p> <p>*No Cover Charge. 21+ to enter and dress to impress!<\/p> <p><b>Incredible hot new designer<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/0\/b\/9\/600_437720665.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/9\/f\/600_446874943.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/happyhournyc\/events\/228857816\/","yes_rsvp_count":49,"duration":16200000,"name":"Heated Rooftop Party @ Skyroom (No Cover)","id":"228857816","time":1455838200000,"updated":1456624047000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1157217191000,"name":"\"The Happy Hour & Brunch Group of NY - 20's, 30's & Beyond\"","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":317159,"urlname":"happyhournyc","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Fun New Yorkers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":4.04737043381,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444714147000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This Thursday...

How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options.

To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection.

Today, in contrast, we have smartphones, Google Fit and FitBit that can track our movements and exercise, smartwatches that can monitor our heart rates (with varying accuracy), apps that can photograph our food and identify its nutritional values, and more. As a Q-Selfer, I use the data I garner from this self-tracking for personal productivity and performance whenever I am looking at how my GTD-inspired productivity system is working.<\/p> <p>How do you use self-tracking in your own life? How might you start to use the principles of Quantified Self to monitor your inputs, states, and performance? How can this inform your own GTD-inspired practice and system? Those will be the main discussion points of our upcoming Meetup! I hope you can join us for this fascinating topic.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to bring your copy of GTD for reference, your questions and thoughts on problem-solving as well! Your conversation contributions are what make the discussions awesome!<\/p> <p><b>III.

This is a fun project-driven night and we will definitely set up reading and writing of RFID and NFC devices. **This event is hosted by Hoboken MakerBar NOT CfN.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"3rd Floor**","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Code-for-Newark\/events\/228459753\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"RFID and NFC Hack Night @ Hoboken MakerBar","id":"228459753","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455851677000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1401298585000,"name":"Code for Newark","group_lon":-74.1999969482,"id":14731212,"urlname":"Code-for-Newark","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Coders and Civic Hackers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":39,"distance":2.96166658401,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447191168000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello,<\/p> <p>In Honor of Fat Tuesday and the chance of possible Snow we are moving the Meet up to Next Thursday Everyone interested in going please reconfirm. by\u00a0<\/p> <p>Look forward to seeing you all next week. do not eat too much and stay warm<\/p> <p>All the best\u00a0<\/p> <p>Mike D<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.affinitytrading.com\">proprietary trading<\/a><\/p>","why":"Please RSVP as the front desk needs to now who is coming","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/daytraders-225\/events\/227129478\/","yes_rsvp_count":39,"duration":10800000,"name":"New York Traders Educational Network Monthly Meetup","id":"cshdmlyvdbmb","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455902167000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1217743702000,"name":"New York Traders Educational Network","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":1244211,"urlname":"daytraders-225","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Day\/Swing Traders"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"2nd floor, Room 206A","name":"One Metro Tech Center","lon":0,"id":23968986,"state":"NY","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.4617433548,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450999198000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/d\/c\/600_445372444.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"#2, #3, #4, #5 to Borough Hall stop and walk 4 minutes to Jay Street; #A,C,F train to Jay Street\/ Metro Tech Center stop and walk 300 feet to location.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Toastmasters-for-Entrepreneurs-Meetup\/events\/227614316\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"Let's Talk About Your Business","id":"227614316","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455848356000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1429421085000,"name":"Toastmasters for Entrepreneurs Meetup Group","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":18553787,"urlname":"Toastmasters-for-Entrepreneurs-Meetup","group_lat":40.7000007629,"who":"Game-Changers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"W St & Warren St","name":"Ball Fields Battery Park City","lon":-74.012932,"id":23932860,"lat":40.716389,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":9,"distance":2.61974668503,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":4,"created":1451404376000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>No-show policy: 1 no-show--&gt;1 RSVP cancelled, 2 no-shows--&gt;Removal from group<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Fields just north of Brookfield Place","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Battery-Park-Pickup-soccer-5v5\/events\/228232592\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"Pickup soccer in Battery Park City","id":"tspfnlyvdbxb","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455853747000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1435764326000,"name":"New York - Battery Park - Pickup soccer 5v5 - Thu","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":18711983,"urlname":"New-York-Battery-Park-Pickup-soccer-5v5","group_lat":40.7099990845,"who":"People"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"322 East 6th Street between 1st and 2nd","name":"Raj Mahal","lon":-74.005943,"id":24203829,"state":"NY","lat":40.712784,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.70907855034,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454356139000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This event is being sponsored by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorksocialnetwork.com\/\">The New York Social Network<\/a> and their partner Meet Up groups.\u00a0 The number of RSVP's below reflect only a portion of those attending.

Another RFID project is a workbench inventory management system which bins with RFID tags have components or supplies stored in them and the shelf knows how many are in which bin at what location no matter where you put the bin back.

What better way to spend winter than with an evening shoot with none other than Jenny Ettie Barr! She always bring enthusiasm and creativity to her shoots and we are happy to spotlight her this month.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>About Model Spotlight Shoots:<\/b><\/p> <p>With this type of shoot there will be one model. (Limited smaller group than our bigger shoots) It could be a traveling model, one of our member favorites or a model with a unique concept. These shoots are designed to be more intricate as far as lighting scheme, concepts and free form. (The freedom to adjust lighting, sets, add props and make the look your own with plenty of time to do so.) We will have a basic starting point for the look but you are encouraged to experiment. (I will be on hand to help where needed.)<\/p> <p><b>About the Shoot:<\/b><\/p> <p>We have three look planned. The first is a concept idea..we are thinking of an edgy, badass look. (Camouflage, vinyl pants, fake guns, etc) But with a sexy glamour twist, of course. The second is lingerie look using our LED lighting for a more moody look. The third is an implied look. (TBD...will update info soon)<\/p> <p><b>RSVP:<\/b><\/p> <p><i>Please take a moment to read the new\u00a0Deposit\u00a0info below in the\u00a0Policy and Disclaimers\u00a0section. We have setup a deposit system to hold a spot for a shoot. So, please\u00a0only\u00a0sign up when you are sure of your attendance and ready to make the deposit to hold your spot. (This also lets anyone on a waitlist able to join the shoot if you are not sure of your attendance yet.) Your spot is\u00a0not\u00a0held till the deposit is received and I'll send you a\u00a0confirmation message or confirm your spot on the Meetup page. All deposits need to be received immediately upon signup or within 5 days of the shoot or we will have to fill the unconfirmed spot\/s ASAP or cancel the shoot (existing deposits returned) if the minimum RSVP is not met. (No, deposit is needed if you are on the waitlist but check back to see if your waitlist status has been updated to \"Yes\".)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Total Cost:\u00a0$80<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Deposit: $20 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/nandopro\/20.00\">Paypal<\/a>)<\/b><\/p> <p>(<i>Don't mark the checkbox on the PayPal page as that adds the surcharge automatically. If we have to return a deposit for any reason, it will be less than originally deposited.)<\/i><\/p> <p><b>Balance due at time of shoot:<\/b>\u00a0$60, Cash preferred, Credit Cards\/Paypal ok with $5 added for surcharge.<\/p> <p>Non-Commercial Release PDF will be emailed to you at the email address given on the sign in sheet.<\/p> <p><b>Model:\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Jenny Ettie Barr:\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/jennypics524\/\"><b>Instagram<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p><b>(Photo Credit: NandoPro)<\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/8\/c\/600_446692620.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/9\/a\/600_446692634.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/a\/3\/600_446692643.jpeghttp:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/d\/b\/0\/600_446692656.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Policy and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>One-on-One:<\/b>\u00a0The model will be available for one half hour one on one shoot after the first two hours in the Meetup. If you want to pre-book time before the shoot, send me a message.<\/p> <p><b>Shared One-on-Ones:<\/b>\u00a0We are also implementing a system that has been working for the past few Meetups. It's the sharing of a half hour one on one with a fellow photographer. It can be shared together for the whole half hour or 15 minutes each photographer.\u00a0<\/p> <p>____________________________________________________________________<\/p> <p><b>About the Studio:<\/b><\/p> <p>The studios is a beautiful 3,000 sq. ft., climate controlled, \u00a0fully functional studio. (Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>About\u00a0The Meetup Format:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will keep the group small although we have the space to accommodate a big group. This keeps things from feeling rushed and overwhelming. Each photographer will have a set amount of time per look. This will allow you to \u00a0shoot as you would in an actual client shoot and not have to worry about the number of shots you are taking. (This proved to be ideal in our previous shoots as far as being able to get \"the shot\" and enough time to do so. Think of it as a mini one-on-one time with the model.) During the shoot we may opt to give a theme a direction to shoot for. As it would be for an actual client. (Ex: If the setup calls for a \"cover shot\" then it will give you a direction to aim for and to consider what equipment to use or what mood to capture.) No worries, bring what lens or lenses you have, you'll learn to use what you have for best results. We strive to bring forth real world conditions and parameters so there is a methodology to a setup or theme.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p><b>Right to Refuse<\/b>\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency. Lack of minimum RSVP to hold the event will also cause postponement of the shoot. The night before we would make the call wether to postpone so be on the look out for our email and Meetup page updates.<\/p> <p>Any questions please email me at\u00a0<b>[masked]<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society\/events\/228712002\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":10800000,"name":"Model Spotlight: Badass Glamour, Lingerie & Implied Shoot w\/Jenny - Feb. 18th","id":"228712002","time":1455840000000,"updated":1455890702000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1367290479000,"name":"Photographer & Model Photoshoot Society","group_lon":-74.3099975586,"id":8282342,"urlname":"Photographer-Model-Photoshoot-Society","group_lat":40.8800010681,"who":"Photo Enthusiast"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Montclair","address_1":"39 Glen Ridge Ave.","name":"NEOLYTH","lon":-74.207619,"id":23633876,"state":"NJ","lat":40.809002,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.1183538437,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1443629166000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Psychic or not - here we go!

Devastated at age 12 by the murder of his mother at the hands of his father, Mr. Slaughter traveled a long and difficult philosophical and psychological road toward resolution. Chief witness against his father, Slaughter was obsessed with revenge against his father. After three decades of estrangement, Mr. Slaughter and his father, Ulysses, Sr., reunited and co-founded The Odyssey Project a dynamic human development campaign committed to \"family reconciliation through father restoration.\" Slaughter is an entrepreneur, author and filmmaker behind the powerful documentary collection \"Odyssey To Save Ulysses.\" Ulysses is not one who places abstract or random theory above the truest value of concrete experience.

Forget what you know about reconciliation.<\/p> <p><br\/>At the young age of 12, Ulysses Slaughter listened as his mother Clarice was shot to death by his father Ulysses Grant Slaughter Sr. Emerging from his bedroom on June 25, 1978, he watched as his mother bled from two gunshot wounds to her head and take some of the last breaths of her life. Stepping over his mother\u2019s fallen body that day was the first, most important act in his amazing odyssey towards forgiveness and reconciliation with his father. Ulysses is not one who places abstract or random theory above the truest value of concrete experience. His journey has taught him intensely profound lessons that no one can comprehend simply through years of research and classroom curriculum alone.<\/p> <p>Ulysses joined OneTaste in October, 2013 and helped to establish the operational container for The Council of Reconciliation. A regular presenter at OneTaste courses (including the Coaching Program, Taboo and the Intensive), Ulysses uses his powerful personal journey to challenge students and staff about infinite, \u201corgasmic\u201d possibilities through radical reconciliation. Since the Council\u2019s development, Ulysses has coordinated and co-facilitated countless community resolution conversations.<\/p> <p>Within his many capacities, Ulysses is a thought leader and one who reconciles victim consciousness.

With group therapy as her primary modality, Christine helps clients in crisis to move in closer to her and the group -- to let others see and touch their loneliness, failures, and emotional pain. To let themselves be loved. And in doing that to create new possibilities. Join Christine as she shares her clinical experience, challenges and discoveries\u00a0and leads us in a conversation that opens up\u00a0new ways of seeing and treating people in crisis.<\/p> <p>Christine LaCerva, M.Ed\u00a0is the director of the Social Therapy Group, a large group practice in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and Manhattan. Trained by Dr. Fred Newman, the founder of social therapy, Christine is now the leading practitioner of this approach. She helps diverse groupings of people create new emotional performances. A talented clinician, educator and artist, Christine has trained in a variety of performance disciplines that she brings to her therapeutic practice to help adults and children grow emotionally. She brings her passion, sensitivity and skill to helping clients develop their lives. Christine directs the Institute's clinical training programs and leads a weekly online supervision group with clinicians and coaches who are integrating the social therapeutic approach in their practices nationally and internationally.<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information or to register go to:\u00a0<\/p> <p>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"http:\/\/eastsideinstitute.org\/events\/&lt;\/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/eastsideinstitute.org\/events\/&lt;\/a&gt<\/a>;<\/p> <p>\u00a0or contact\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Licensed-Mental-Health-Professionals\/events\/228795647\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":5400000,"name":"CONVERSATIONS WITH PRACTITIONERS Critical Innovative Therapies","id":"228795647","time":1455926400000,"updated":1455933457000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1447807507000,"name":"NYC- Licensed Mental Health Professionals","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19132160,"urlname":"NYC-Licensed-Mental-Health-Professionals","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10022","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"153 East 53rd Street","name":"Atrium at Citigroup Center ","lon":-73.970444,"id":4611332,"state":"NY","lat":40.758438,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.18020117283,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434143344000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>\u30fc NEW MEMBERS ARE WELCOME \u30fc<\/p> <p><b>What is J-Kuru?<\/b><\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/nDFyNCO8D1U<\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>These evening events are for those who want to learn Japanese \u00a0&amp; \"\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u305f\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\" \u3002\u00a0Beginner intermediate, and advanced levels are all welcome!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/a\/b\/8\/600_398215992.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Practice &amp; improve your Japanese\/English in a fun, casual environment--and make a few friends along the way!

Meatloaf\u2014simple, familiar, and filling\u2014epitomizes the comfort-food appeal of such dishes.\u00a0Cedar Street Grill\u2019s\u00a0(Dobbs Ferry) applewood-smoked bacon-wrapped meatloaf is served with garlic whipped, skin-on Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and a demi-glace that takes days to make from roasted veal-bone stock, fresh herbs, and red wine. Shiitake mushrooms and caramelized onions top it off.\u00a0<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"please find us in the bar","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/diningout-219\/events\/228886166\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Let's go to Cedar Street Grill for Comfort food in Dobbs Ferry","id":"228886166","time":1455926400000,"updated":1457273899000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1129506815000,"name":"Cheap Eats and other foodie delights of Westchester","group_lon":-73.8300018311,"id":211795,"urlname":"diningout-219","group_lat":40.9199981689,"who":"Cheap Eats and Foodies"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"11211 Brooklyn","address_1":"232 North 12th Street","name":"Sottocasa Pizzeria","lon":-73.953064,"id":24132329,"state":"NY","lat":40.719269,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":2.87767076492,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455647081000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Dear friends and members,<\/p> <p>We are very happy to invite you to a special event:<\/p> <p>\"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Day\"<\/p> <p>In collaboration with Valdiano Food Distributors and Eataliano USA, New York Italians will bring you to the renowned home of the buffalo mozzarella Paestum, Italy without the hassle of an airplane ticket!<\/p> <p>Buffalo Mozzarella and Buffalo Ricotta tastings and sampling from 7pm to 9pm.<\/p> <p>Mr. Nicola D'Alessio from Valdiano Food Distributors will provide an historical explanation of the difference between real buffalo mozzarella and the ones on the market, and will also have you taste them and give you some hints and recipes to better serve the mozzarella.<\/p> <p>For information and RSVP please email us at:<\/p> <p>[masked]<\/p> <p>Grazie e Buona mozzarella!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/newyork-italians-org\/events\/228897700\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"\"Mozzarella Day: how to recognize the real mozzarella di bufala\"","id":"228897700","time":1455926400000,"updated":1455938165000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1281671700000,"name":"NEW YORK ITALIANS","group_lon":-73.9400024414,"id":1690232,"urlname":"newyork-italians-org","group_lat":40.8199996948,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"98 3rd Ave (btw 12th & 13th St)","name":"Bar None","lon":-73.98307,"id":9208602,"state":"NY","lat":40.730644,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.38852417469,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455637704000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Age range - (Women 35 - 48, Men 21 - 33)<\/p> <p>This speed dating event is for older women and younger men.

It's great if you can RSVP in advance, but in case you can't, come anyway.<\/p> <p>As a reminder, this group has two goals. The first is to explore the relationship between happiness and goodness. The second, much more fun, goal is for us to become much happier just by getting together and talking about happiness. The theory behind this second goal comes from a classic psychology study showing that by simply talking regularly about happiness we can become much happier.<\/p> <p>While we'll depart from them whenever and however much we may wish, like by talking about gratitude, acts of kindness, meditation and other happiness techniques, the following list of 14 topics will serve as a backdrop for our discussions.<\/p> <p>1. Keep busy and be more active<br\/>2. Spend more time socializing<br\/>3. Be productive at meaningful work<br\/>4. Get better organized and plan things out<br\/>5. Stop worrying<br\/>6. Lower your expectations and aspirations<br\/>7. Develop positive, optimistic thinking<br\/>8. Become present oriented<br\/>9. Develop an outgoing, social personality<br\/>10. Work on a healthy personality<br\/>11. Be yourself<br\/>12. Eliminate negative feelings and problems<br\/>13. Close relationships are the number one source of happiness<br\/>14. Put happiness as your most important priority.<\/p> <p>Here's some background on the research our group is based on.<\/p> <p>In 1980 three New Zealand researchers found that after eight 2-hour conversation sessions about happiness over four weeks, their subjects reported a 22 percent increase in their happiness. Continuing their twice-weekly sessions, by the sixteenth week they reported being 42 percent happier.<\/p> <p>Our list of topics comes from Fort Myers, Florida psychologist Michael Fordyce's \"14 Fundamentals of Happiness.\" In 1977, Fordyce pioneered the science of happiness-increase with the world's first experiment designed to boost individual happiness.<\/p> <p>That's the group, and those are our goals. It's also very, very important that we have fun. With that in mind, let's get ready to get good and happy!<\/p> <p><br\/>Resources:<\/p> <p>For those interested in learning about the major findings from social science research about happiness, and becoming happier, here are links to several excellent peer-reviewed articles that can be downloaded as pdf files for free.
