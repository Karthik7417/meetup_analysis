However, please note the purpose of this group is to cultivate friendships and is not a target for soliciting goods or services through events. Anyone requesting to join the group with a 'business and\/or marketing intent' will be denied (i.e., home-based business parties such as Tupperware, Candles, Jewelry, etc.). Thanks for understanding!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;3) Please RSVP 'Yes' for an event only if you're sure you're able to attend. Space may be limited and therefore some events fill up quickly. To that end, if you have (2) or more 'No Shows' (meaning you RSVP'd 'Yes' but never 'Confirmed' for the event or showed up), you will automatically be removed to the 'Wait List' for future events. In addition, please do not RSVP 'Yes' but add a comment such as 'more of a maybe'. If you do, your RSVP will be removed, or you too will be moved to the wait list. <\/p>\n<p>4) Usually about (1) week prior to the event an email will be sent to those who RSVP'd \"Yes\" requesting that you 'Confirm' for that event. Please take a moment at that time to go to the event page, click on 'Update' (located next to the green GOING button) and add in comments section: 'Confirmed'. This step is important as most times an accurate headcount is needed to reserve a table. If you are unable to attend once that email is sent out, please kindly change your RSVP to 'Not Going'; it frees up space for another member that may currently be on the 'Waiting List' for that event.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;5) Inactive members will be removed. <\/p>\n<p>6) Lastly, show up!!

Ideally, each group will have a like-minded focus. This is a very intensive, right-to-the-point group that will follow a three month syllabus (1st month: pitch, story beats, outline, Act 1, 2nd month: 1\/2 of the script finished, 3rd month: final script finished) with deadlines, page counts, readings from screenwriting books and scripts, and edits. Each week the members will send each other their pages a couple before meet-up night, they'll print them out and read them on their own time, writing detailed edits, notes, and a write-up about the pages, as well as working on their own material. We'll then meet weekly to discuss with each other and do some voluntary readings of the scripts. This is for the most dedicated, hard-working, and passionate aspiring TV writers who have the time and availability to dedicate themselves to this group.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":93598172,"name":"William Heus","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/highres_255698255.jpeg","photo_id":255698255,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/member_255698255.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/5\/6\/f\/thumb_255698255.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"NYC TV Writing Intensive Workshop","id":19844054,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-TV-Writing-Intensive-Workshop","category":{"name":"writing","id":36,"shortname":"writing"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"aspiring TV writers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1460741304000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"minipinscher","name":"Miniature Pinscher","id":2009},{"urlkey":"smallbreeddogs","name":"Small Breed Dogs","id":7929},{"urlkey":"offleash","name":"Off-Leash Dog Recreation","id":9753},{"urlkey":"activedogs","name":"Active Dogs","id":9772},{"urlkey":"dog-parks","name":"Dog Parks","id":17407},{"urlkey":"dog-play-groups","name":"Dog Playgroups","id":18340},{"urlkey":"dog-walks","name":"Dog Walks","id":18874},{"urlkey":"small-dog-playgroup","name":"Small Dog Playgroup","id":53434},{"urlkey":"min-pin","name":"min pin","id":70786}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NY-NJ-Waterfront-Miniature-Pinscher-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"Calling all Miniature Pinscher owners!

We do high intensity cardio sessions that combine all the best attributes of a dance class and fitness class. Here, you will get to jam to some fun upbeat music, while working out and toning your body. If you've ever admired dancers for their bodies or the way they, here's your chance to learn some new moves and get that dancer's body. We do fitness based dance sessions, which means you do not have to \"know how to dance\" to participate. We teach dance moves and combinations that are easy to learn so that you can focus on having fun. All the music and dances used will be urban, pop and Afro-Caribbean based styles, such as hip hop, dancehall, pop, soca and more. If you're looking to learn how to dance the Waltz or the Foxtrot, this is not the group for you. If you're looking for something that will allow you to have fun, learn some new moves and help you get fit, you found the right place. Just in time to get that summer body. Come join us and let's jam!<\/p>\n<p>About the meetups: Meetup sessions are located in NYC, usually in Manhattan and are roughly 1 hr long including warm ups, high intensity cardio fun, and cool downs.

You'll have a chance to stretch your skills. There are no fees, however, new members will be asked some screening questions, and a profile is required (photo is not). There will be 8 slots available per meetup date although 3-4 is the ideal size. Guitar friendly instruments and singers are welcome to join.<\/p>","lon":-73.7799987793,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13120765,"name":"Lou Alleluia","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/a\/6\/highres_232386822.jpeg","photo_id":232386822,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/a\/6\/member_232386822.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/a\/a\/6\/thumb_232386822.jpeg"}},"members":17,"name":"Crocheron Guitar Jams","id":19855384,"state":"NY","urlname":"Crocheron-Guitar-Jams","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7799987793,"who":"jammers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Merrick","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461007893000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"fitness","name":"Fitness","id":242},{"urlkey":"walkers","name":"Walking","id":933},{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"outdoors","name":"Outdoors","id":15046},{"urlkey":"leisure-walking","name":"Leisure Walking","id":15834},{"urlkey":"low-level-walking","name":"Low level walking","id":15891},{"urlkey":"walking-for-fitness","name":"Walking for Fitness","id":15893},{"urlkey":"walking-for-your-health","name":"Walking for your health","id":19599},{"urlkey":"stroller-walking","name":"Stroller Walking","id":19739},{"urlkey":"excercise","name":"Exercise","id":25375},{"urlkey":"photo-walks","name":"Photo Walks","id":59343}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Merrick-Walking-Meetup\/","rating":5,"description":"This is a group for anyone interested in walking, socializing, picture taking, enjoy the outdoors etc. All skills levels are welcome.

It takes many different forms depending on the country and region, both in costume and dance style. New styles have evolved in western culture as its popularity has spread globally. Belly dance is a low-impact, weight-bearing exercise, osteoporosis preventive and is suitable for all ages and fitness level. The dance is enjoyed and performed by women and men as well. The dance often focuses upon isolating different parts of the body, moving them independently in sensuous patterns, weaving together the entire body.

So if you are free ahead of time &nbsp;or want to plan a last minute ride because you didn't realize how warm it is outside, and you want the company then put up a meetup. Let's just get out the house and ride.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Ride Durations\/Type - <\/b>So many ride for work so let's do a ride for pleasure. Rides can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours+. Personally, after 90 minutes I need a break... this group is open to all motorcycle types such as canam, slingshots, sportbikes, cruisers, etc .&nbsp;<span>Group good for folks that don't want to always push 150mph on the highway but okay with a highway range of 60-100mph (depending on traffic\/weather) and residential less than 55mph of course. Group good for riders who just want to cruise down the GSP, local roads and take advantage of the weather since it's cold up here more than hot. Face it... we're not in Sunny California. So any day over 60 degrees I'm on my bike, even if it is just to the gym.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I love riding to Bear mountain... have you been!! Nice easy ride. Looking for others to give ideas and share where they ride to. This is for the general area of North Jersey, Central Jersey, Parts of upstate NY (like Rockland county), &nbsp;couple NYC rides (if we're brave enough to dodge the pot holes and traffic\/rare). Don't want to suck up your whole day, just a couple of hours. I get cold easily so most rides that I plan will be in the early afternoon when the sun is the hottest. Once summer hits and it's over 65 degrees by 7am.... &nbsp;I'm all open to morning rides when the cars aren't out yet. When you plan\/host a meetup, you can make it whenever. If you want to do a Waffle house run to Bethlem, PA (45-60 minutes) I'm always up for that run.. straight shot!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Come to a last minute meet up or host a meetup yourself. Be sure to enable email notification since this group is all about last minutes or check our twitter @njlastminriders. I'll try to post on twitter as the meetups come up... i'm not great with twitter but i'm working on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Group requirement -&nbsp;<\/b><span>If you have a motorcycle endorsement on your VALID license then you can ride with us. Must have valid license, registration and insurance when riding in this group.&nbsp;<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Meetup Dues - Anyone who rides can join and post meetups. Dues are $3 annual. Which is to cover the monthly meetup fees I get hit with. Plus only serious riders who actually ride won't mind the $3 which is less than a tank of gas for your bike.&nbsp;<\/b>&nbsp;Don't want to be one of those groups with a bunch of members but only 3-4 people go on rides. Please don't add this group just to be a member. You need to actually participate even if it's only one ride.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Why was I removed from the group? <\/b>&nbsp;If you sign up for a ride and are a \"No show\" instead of removing yourself from the RSVP then you will be removed from the group after the third \"no show\". This group has a total group max of 50 people. Don't want to be a huge group like other meetups just want serious people that ride. There is a two week trial for this group then $3 dues are due to remain in this group. If you find yourself too busy to participate please remove yourself from group, so others can join.

People with background in business, technology, marketing and finance, sales etc. in any industry are all welcome to join. You don't need a prototype or an MVP to pitch. You just need an idea. After all, the companies that changed the way we do things all started with an idea. People coming together to build incredible teams turn ideas into companies. So let's connect and build teams.

And honestly, it isn't that easy making friend these days. Second, I created it for my plus size women in their 20s and 30s who are looking to build a sisterhood with other women who understand what comes along with being plus size but at the same time does not let that define them.

Artists curious about exploring public nudity. Gay\/Straight. All those who seek a free and encouraging environment to explore the human form. You will learn something. You will make a friend. Come with a mind open to new experiences. This is a safe space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No cover - Donations greatly appreciated&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>RSVP - space is limited&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1) What IS Naked Drink n Draw?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** It's an immersive study in figure drawing while under the influence. In short, you get naked, have some drinks, and draw each other. Sound fun? It is! I will generally start off the night as the first model. After that, we take a volunteer from the pool of artists. We'll continue to take turns as models while everyone else draws. The parlor will be set up for drawing, the work room will be set up for painting, and if enough people are in attendance, the bedroom may be made available for additional drawing space. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>2) I can\u2019t draw...&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** I can't draw either. It's not about that. Nobody's going to laugh at you if you suck. You could be god awful, but you may find you're better than you think. I can guarantee you won\u2019t be the only shitty artist in the room. Besides, the only way to improve is with practice, and what better way to learn?! <br><br><\/p>\n<p>3) Are the drawings judged?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** There will be a period at the end to critique each others' work, but nobody has to participate. No obligations to share your work. If you are comfortable with your work being photographed, I would like to post it on the group pages. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>4) How much is it?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** It\u2019s free! Of course, tips are greatly appreciated for snacks and supplies. It's normally $20 each but, if you can't afford it, we won't let that keep you from participating. it's called \"struggling artists\" for a reason. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>5) Can I model?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** You are more than welcome to model. Take turns! Ideally, if we're all naked, we all stand an opportunity as model if we so desire. The only rule I have is you must be nude to pose. That is sort of the point, after all. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>6) What do I bring?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** Bring supplies and booze. I will provide some supplies for those without, but I'm afraid I can not supply free booze. But hey, tip generously and I'll think about it ;P <br><br><\/p>\n<p>7) Can I take photos?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** Nope. You can draw pictures, but you can\u2019t snap them. Why, you might ask? It's kinda creepy, in a room full of naked strangers, to pull out your camera. Even if you ask, putting one \"No\" on the spot in a room full of \"Yes\" is the sort of intimidation and alienation I'm hoping to avoid. Respect this rule, please. Don't be a creep. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>8) Who can come?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** Anyone! with some conditions&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-If I do not know you, and we have never spoken, shoot me a message first.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-If you want to bring a guest or three, let me know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>-If you want to come but not get naked, you better be the life of the party.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>9) Anything else I should know?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>***This is a safe space with supportive people and a free and encouraging energy. While people will be naked, don't just assume that's license to read someone's ass like it's brail. Please be respectful, consensual adults. If you start to creep people out, you leave. Also, please be quiet in the stairwell. My neighbors are real sweet people, you guys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>10) Where is it?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** Ocean ave at Parkside Ave in Brooklyn. Parkside ave Q stop. Three buildings from the subway, on Ocean, across from the park.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br>11) My boyfriend is not comfortable with me coming to this thing. Is this a sex party?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** This is my home. Keep sexpectations to a minimum, and know the line between sex and sexy. We also have couples come to every event. If your significant other is jealous, bring them! That said, if anything grows while you pose, don't sweat it. Appreciate it. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>12) How many people will be there? Will it be crowded?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** I'm saying maximum capacity is 30. Won't be crowded. <br><br><\/p>\n<p>13) What kind of poses are we doing?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*** ENTIRELY up to you. You can go anywhere from Venus De Milo modesty to spred out and comfy. We're just naked people sketching naked people. For the first few hours we'll be working with short poses. After that we'll move on to longer poses. You can do couple\/group long poses or individual 10 minute poses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions feel free to call or text me at 347.409.1220&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/highres_449398619.jpeg","photo_id":449398619,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/600_449398619.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/4\/f\/b\/thumb_449398619.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":203633253,"name":"Nick Stryker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/highres_256029144.jpeg","photo_id":256029144,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/member_256029144.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/3\/b\/8\/thumb_256029144.jpeg"}},"members":33,"name":"Naked Drink N Draw (NDND)","id":19884110,"state":"NY","urlname":"NDNDBrooklyn","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.6599998474,"who":"Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bayside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461648037000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"moms","name":"Moms","id":407},{"urlkey":"playgroup","name":"Playdates","id":9853},{"urlkey":"parents","name":"Parents","id":10333},{"urlkey":"families","name":"Family","id":16024},{"urlkey":"kids","name":"Kids","id":16030},{"urlkey":"toddler","name":"Toddlers","id":17147},{"urlkey":"healthy-kids-happy-kids","name":"HEALTHY KIDS - HAPPY KIDS","id":19625},{"urlkey":"healthy-kids","name":"Healthy Kids","id":26024},{"urlkey":"arts-crafts-for-kids","name":"Arts & Crafts for Kids","id":26389},{"urlkey":"kids-helping-kids","name":"Kids Helping Kids","id":93680},{"urlkey":"kids-meeting-kids","name":"Kids Meeting Kids","id":655642}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bayside-Kids-Reading-and-Games-Club\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Being a parent of 2 young boys, I can totally see how addicting tablets, smartphones, computer games can be to them.

UNY began in 1999, and quickly grew to become a thriving spiritual community in the Unity Worldwide movement and remains so today in the heart of New York City. Unity of New York is led by spiritual director and music minister, Rev Britt Hall. Unity is a positive path for spiritual living that provides practical teachings to help people live healthy, prosperous and meaningful lives. We honor all paths to God as we provide a philosophy that is spiritual, not religious; and love-based, not fear-based. We strive to help individuals have a stronger connection to God every day by helping them to feel empowered, accepted, loved, inspired and connected. Every follower of Unity principles (sometimes referred to as Truth Student) is free to believe what he or she chooses about God\/Spirit and our place in this beautiful and abundant universe. However, there are five concepts that Unity holds to be basic tenets: 1. God is Absolute Good. We don\u2019t believe God is a mean and vindictive man in the sky waiting to punish us for failing. God is found within our very being as Love, Peace, Joy, Wisdom, Light, Life and Perfection Itself. These God qualities are available and accessible to all of us at any moment when we simply go within to where our Creator resides. We believe that there is only One Power and One Presence in the universe and in our lives \u2013 God the Good. 2. Since God is Good, then all of us, as God\u2019s creation, must also be good. We do not believe in the concept of Original Sin; we believe that we have been created in Original Blessing. You are God\u2019s wonderful, perfect offspring at this very moment, even if you have forgotten that Truth. God cannot create anything less than Itself. Jesus, our great Teacher and Elder Brother reminded us: \u201cYou are gods\u201d (John 10:34). However, to access the fullness of this Truth, we have to awaken to it and become a co-creator with God. 3. We access God\u2019s wholeness, prosperity, peace of mind, and joy by transforming our thoughts, words and actions from negative, limiting, and defeatist, to positive, joyful and optimistic ones. We are responsible for the kind of lives we lead, regardless of what life has been up to this point. When we change our thoughts\/beliefs, we change our lives. 4. Through affirmative prayer and meditation, we experience God within us. When we take time during the day to turn everything over to Spirit, we receive exactly the right information needed to make our lives work. We must take time daily in silence for the renewal of our minds, souls and bodies. 5. Knowing these Truths intellectually isn\u2019t enough; we must implement them daily \u2013 for the realization of our Oneness with God, and to be a blessing and of service to others. Scripture tells us, \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d With joyful enthusiasm we make life a great adventure, and we (and others) are blessed beyond measure by the creative use of these Truth principles. &nbsp;For more info please chck out our web site at: unityofnewyork.org&nbsp;<\/p>","lon":-74.0199966431,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/highres_449441643.jpeg","photo_id":449441643,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/600_449441643.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/a\/b\/thumb_449441643.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":202397721,"name":"Louis O.","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/highres_256108368.jpeg","photo_id":256108368,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/member_256108368.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/6\/e\/d\/0\/thumb_256108368.jpeg"}},"members":42,"name":"Unity of New York~Spiritual Center Sunday Service","id":19887325,"state":"NY","urlname":"Unity-of-New-York-Spiritual-Center-Sunday-Service","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.7099990845,"who":"Members, Truth Students, Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461718703000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"mtg","name":"Magic: The Gathering","id":864},{"urlkey":"cardgame","name":"Card Games","id":9792},{"urlkey":"tabletop-role-playing-and-board-games","name":"Tabletop Role Playing and Board Games","id":16714},{"urlkey":"strategy-games","name":"Strategy Games","id":17785},{"urlkey":"game-design","name":"Game Design","id":19225},{"urlkey":"board-games","name":"Board Games","id":19585},{"urlkey":"sci-fi","name":"Sci-Fi","id":21258},{"urlkey":"deck-building-games","name":"Deck Building Games","id":168992}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Star-Realms-NYC\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Let's play Star Realms and do some Star Realms tournaments!

Singles can hang out with other singles in a casual non-threatening environment. We just want to help singles get out and enjoy life while they are single.

Cool couples are welcome to attend our great events as well. <\/p>\n<p>VOLUNTEERS WANTED!<\/p>\n<p>To keep our events low cost or FREE, we ask for volunteers to organize and host events.

Most volunteers don\u2019t stay single for long.

Please spread the word through your networks! &lt;br&gt;\ufffc Teacher Bio: &lt;br&gt;It began seven years ago as I looked in awe at my friend as she balanced on nothing but her hands. I was from a small, homogeneous town, yoga seemed exotic, and I was competitive. \"I need to learn to do that,\" I thought, and then signed up for my first yoga class. However, what started out as an interest primarily in the physical aspect of yoga (asana) gradually and organically expanded. I noticed yoga seeping into my everyday life, and the results were positive. I taught as an apprentice in Buenos Aires in 2013 and later received 200 hours of training at Jai Yoga Arts, 30 hours at Karma Kids, and continue my studies through daily asana and meditation. I consider my practice to be a 24-hour endeavor, and encourage my students to apply the lessons they learn on the mat to lead more peaceful, aware and joyful lives. In addition to my yoga training, I have studied Rolfing\/Structural Integration through international apprenticeship and workshops, and offer sessions privately. In my classes you can expect to be challenged, yet supported with precise anatomical cues and hands-on adjustments.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/a\/highres_450163338.jpeg","photo_id":450163338,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/a\/600_450163338.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/9\/4\/a\/thumb_450163338.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","members":16,"name":"Brooklyn Yoga Williamsburg","id":19893804,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Yoga-Williamsburg","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Brooklyn Yogis"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Brooklyn","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461866372000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"human-sexuality","name":"Human Sexuality","id":17854},{"urlkey":"fetishes","name":"Fetishes","id":24462},{"urlkey":"erotic-voyuerism","name":"Erotic Voyuerism","id":29279},{"urlkey":"erotic-exhibitionists","name":"Erotic Exhibitionists","id":29280},{"urlkey":"sexuality-awareness","name":"Sexuality Awareness","id":32303},{"urlkey":"clothing-optional-recreation","name":"Clothing Optional Recreation","id":39871},{"urlkey":"nudity","name":"Nudity","id":43245},{"urlkey":"body-image","name":"Body Image","id":75153},{"urlkey":"celebrate-sensuality","name":"Sensuality","id":93385},{"urlkey":"cmnm","name":"CMNM","id":1507909}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Body-Image-Personal-Fantasy-Support-Group\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you have a shadow life which only exists in your head and maybe on craigslist? &nbsp;Well, join the club. &nbsp;This group is a judgment free zone where you can talk freely about relationships, sexuality, fetishes, body image and identity issues, anything really, with a group of people who are there to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>We're all fascinatingly different with regard to the particulars, but very much alike in the way we go through a lot of the same stuff. &nbsp;Figuring out what we want, how to satisfy that nagging feeling inside and trying to navigate the craziness of craigslist or whatever.<\/p>\n<p>This group will be fueled by honesty, integrity, trust, respect and shared humanity on the part of each participant. &nbsp;With those qualities in abundance, it can surely be rewarding and a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p>The content is basically anything goes, but to distinguish this from a sex or fetish party, it will operate as a succession of presentations. &nbsp;We'll call each one a Presenter. &nbsp;After getting acquainted and selecting a random ordering of Presenters, one by one each will have the opportunity to address the group and have its full attention. &nbsp;It may sound a little nerve wracking, and it very well may be, but that goes with the territory.<\/p>\n<p>The job of the participants will be to help each Presenter feel comfortable and supported as they attempt to work out whatever it is they need to work out, even if they don't quite know it themselves. &nbsp;It is extremely difficult to shed our defenses and be in the world without the safety of the masks we typically wear. &nbsp;At the same time, not being our true selves wears us down and robs us of living life fully. &nbsp;Most of us wish we could let our inner selves break free.<\/p>\n<p>That's what this is about. &nbsp;Important to state, all this nice, touchy, feely talk doesn't mean that the content will be all nice and touchy feely. &nbsp;Quite the contrary. &nbsp;Who knows what kind of \"crazy\" shit we're into? &nbsp;Sadism or masochism, exhibitionism or voyeurism, other fetishes, compulsive masturbation, we may feel miserable about our physical appearance, feel lonely and isolated, or just maybe a wee bit repressed. &nbsp;Any kinds of generalizations belie the true diversity of the dynamic individuals we all are and what makes us tick.<\/p>\n<p>Want to come and find out? &nbsp;Discover yourself in someone else's vastly different journey? &nbsp;Talk about things you've never been able to reveal to friends and family? &nbsp;Express things you are so ashamed of you feel the world will come crashing down, only to find acceptance, comradeship and helpful feedback?<\/p>\n<p>Well, then maybe you should be part of this group.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may be sensitive about subjects they consider gross or taboo, so as a participant you're just going to have to know yourself well enough to decide whether this is for you. &nbsp;Presenters may place themselves in very vulnerable positions, so we will all need to respond with a reasonable balance of honesty and support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a Presenter, you'll be free to go wherever this takes you, but refrain from crossing boundaries that might destroy the ability of the group to function. &nbsp;No outright hostility toward other participants, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone must agree to treat the things that occur with COMPLETE DISCRETION AND CONFIDENTIALITY. This cannot be over emphasized. &nbsp;Needless to say, no recording of photography will be permitted.<\/p>\n<p>On the subject of nudity, it is completely acceptable on the part of each Presenter during their presentation. &nbsp;Not required, but not at all prohibited. &nbsp;The freedom to be our true selves in the physical sense may play an important role in helping us expand the dynamic range and quality of how we relate to others. &nbsp;Sure, we'll still have our defense mechanisms there to fall back on, but at least our body language will be just that---body language! &nbsp;Nudity purely to shock would probably be frowned upon, but as a means of feeling completely accepted as we are, may be vital.<\/p>\n<p>Any form of sexual contact between participants would not be allowed, again to keep this within the bounds of focusing on the individual Presenter and what they are trying to work through. &nbsp;As far as what is permissible behavior by a Presenter, they should feel free to talk, to move, to express emotion, to disrobe, to touch themselves, dress up however they wish, use sex toys, whatever it is about themselves they want to put out before the group.<\/p>\n<p>This full range of expression is very important. &nbsp;For example, a Presenter who is troubled by a certain compulsion they continually seek to satisfy without success may gain insights from acting out this compulsion before a supportive group that might not be possible otherwise. &nbsp;Sort of getting out of your head and into your body and the real world. &nbsp;Another Presenter may just truly need to feel they are being seen for who they really are. &nbsp;Each will have to figure out for themselves where to draw the line between self indulgence and self examination. &nbsp;Reflecting on what takes place, how did it feel, how did other participants react? &nbsp;These discussions could be very rich indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Meetings would take place in a comfortable private residence in Brooklyn. &nbsp;All are welcome and a diverse group in terms of age, orientation and gender is hoped for. &nbsp;Many details still to be ironed out. &nbsp;Please contact with comments and questions. &nbsp;Thank you for reading!<\/p>","lon":-73.9599990845,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":204185699,"name":"Dave","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/highres_256084318.jpeg","photo_id":256084318,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/member_256084318.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/0\/d\/e\/thumb_256084318.jpeg"}},"members":50,"name":"Brooklyn Body Image\/Personal Fantasy Support Group","id":19893826,"state":"NY","urlname":"Brooklyn-Body-Image-Personal-Fantasy-Support-Group","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Presenters"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461866916000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out","id":713},{"urlkey":"bookclub","name":"Book Club","id":2767},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fiction","name":"Fiction","id":15113},{"urlkey":"novel-reading","name":"Novel Reading","id":15622}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Meeting-Eating-and-Reading\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Group of mid-20s - mid-30s young women professionals with a shared love of reading and good food (and drinks!).

Just like it sounds \u2013 it\u2019s basically a drum circle, but for wind players. How does it work? Well, just like a drum circle, there are no formal rules. However, the participants generally approach it with a common understanding of what it\u2019s about \u2026 <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;All are welcome -- all ages, all skill levels. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Participants can drift in and out both within a session and from week to week. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;We\u2019re all there because we love music, and we\u2019re seeking a collective, supportive atmosphere that encourages listening and learning from each other rather than competition and cutting. <\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Finally, and most important, it\u2019s all about improvisation. There are no arrangements or orchestrations. Nobody leads the session or tries to organize the group to learn tunes in common for the next session. There\u2019s not even any need for talking about how to start when the session begins -- you just show up, join in, and play what you feel ... \u2022&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, it does need to be said that horns are very different than drums, and it might not be possible to spontaneously get a coherent sound like they do in a drum circle. If nothing else, maybe we\u2019d need to talk about what and how we\u2019re going to play before starting, right? Well, yes, some talking would facilitate the process \u2013 and since there are no rules, there definitely wouldn\u2019t be any rule against approaching it this way. On the other hand, though, an approach based on not discussing anything beforehand might be worth trying precisely because it is more challenging. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, those types of details can be worked out. At this point, we\u2019re just trying to gauge the level of interest and reach some people who might want to be involved. In terms of logistics, the venue will be somewhere outdoors (still to be determined -- Central Park? Prospect Park? Under the Williamsburg Bridge?) and we\u2019re hoping there are enough people interested so that we can make this happen once per week throughout the Summer.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":64067062,"name":"Ian McAndrew","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/highres_74772192.jpeg","photo_id":74772192,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/member_74772192.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/f\/a\/0\/thumb_74772192.jpeg"}},"members":38,"name":"NYC Woodwind \/ Brass Improviser's Circle","id":19897709,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Woodwind-Brass-Improvisers-Circle","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"lat":40.7299995422,"who":"creative geniuses"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Jamaica","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1461963938000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"business-strategy","name":"Business Strategy","id":17635},{"urlkey":"startup-businesses","name":"Startup Businesses","id":21681},{"urlkey":"lean-startup","name":"Lean Startup","id":38660},{"urlkey":"business-startup","name":"Business Startup","id":70328},{"urlkey":"startup-pitching","name":"Startup Pitching","id":78721},{"urlkey":"startup-incubation-and-entrepreneurship-mentors","name":"Startup Incubation","id":99649},{"urlkey":"technology-startups","name":"Technology Startups","id":108403},{"urlkey":"internet-startups","name":"Internet Startups","id":128595}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/JamaicaStartFund\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>We are a community of entrepreneurs, coaches, mentors, investors and enthusiastic collaborators bringing new and innovative ideas to life.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/start.fund\">Neighborhood Start Fund<\/a> is a neighborhood-specific entrepreneurship fund created by Di-Ann Eisnor and Lupe Fiasco focused on turning ideas into reality.

Beach Tennis has similar scoring system to regular tennis, 'Love, 15, 30, 40, Game' with no fault nor advantage points, the ball has no bounce in your court before you hit it back to opponent so it's a quicker game then tennis and lots of fun! The court is similar in size to a beach volleyball court, 16m long x 8m wide. There are several volleyball courts in Central Park, including the courts near Sheep Meadow. If you walk toward the east side of the park from Sheep Meadow, you will find two asphalt courts and one sand court. The courts are in the center of the park near 70th Street and adjacent to the Mall. There are also asphalt courts in the center of the park at 86th Street, next to the Great Lawn and the Central Park police precinct.

Do you live in Inwood\/Northern Manhattan? We are inviting all writers, of all skill levels, to join a newly formed Writer\u2019s Group. We are two writers who need looking to jump start our own practice and want a group that supports the process. Writing can be a very isolating process so we want a community of writers who can help support and stimulate the writing process. This will include guided critiques, open readings of our work, and exploring genres written by authors of color. Writers will be encouraged to share resources, creative influences, along with individual practices. We will meet once a week for eight weeks. Our goals are to expand as writers, create a space for writers of color, allow for safe critique, and stimulate creative growth. Our workshop will focus on the beginning, middle and conclusion of a written piece for future publication and\/or sheer pleasure. The writers group will host a Public Reading in Inwood\/Northern Manhattan (location to be determined) at the end of the eight weeks.

In just one year, I was able to transform my very overweight body into something much leaner, stronger, and healthier.<\/p> \n<p>It dawned on me that society, as well as the diet and fitness industry, makes healthy living and weight loss seem much harder for people than it really is. With all of the fad diets, expensive supplements, and health myths out there, the average person can hardly be blamed for thinking that healthy living is impossible. It isn't though, and now I want to share my experiences in the hopes of helping others who are looking to make a similar journey.<\/p> \n<p>This group will be easily accessible, with weekend Meetups in cafes and casual eateries where we can all chat in a relaxed setting.

Did the film Ghostbusters inspire your fascination with the paranormal? Do you have a love for film and would like to tackle a new and bold project? There are very few paranormal investigating teams in Brooklyn and I would like to start one. This is also a group for people who enjoy discussing about the paranormal and meeting people who share the same interests. Filmmakers are also welcome (I would also like for us to film our investigations as well) because this is a chance for you to potentially capture something very unique. Whether you are a professional or someone just starting out or a filmmaker looking for a new project to tackle, all are welcome. Ideally we would all meet once a week and plan we will do our investigations and so forth. I would like to go to several haunted locations. The goal of this group is building a team. I would like to not just meet people but hopefully we can all eventually be good friends. I don't care how much experience you have in ghost hunting. I just want to meet people who love the supernatural as much as I do. Hope to see you soon!

Artists curious about exploring public nudity. Gay\/Straight. All those who seek a free and encouraging environment to explore the human form. You will learn something. You will make a friend. Come with a mind open to new experiences. This is a safe space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>$20 cash upon arrival or $15 in advance<\/p>\n<p>All Genders<\/p>\n<p>RSVP - space is limited. A ticket does not ensure entry. You must be on time and on the list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1) What IS Naked Drink n Draw?&nbsp;<br>*** It's an immersive study in figure drawing while under the influence. In short, you get naked, have some drinks, and draw each other. Sound fun? It is! I will generally start off the night as the first model. After that, we take a volunteer from the pool of artists. We'll continue to take turns as models while everyone else draws. The parlor will be set up for drawing, the work room will be set up for painting, and if enough people are in attendance, the bedroom may be made available for additional drawing space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2) I can\u2019t draw...&nbsp;<br>*** I can't draw either. It's not about that. Nobody's going to laugh at you if you suck. You could be god awful, but you may find you're better than you think. I can guarantee you won\u2019t be the only shitty artist in the room. Besides, the only way to improve is with practice, and what better way to learn?!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3) Are the drawings judged?&nbsp;<br>*** There will be a period at the end to critique each others' work, but nobody has to participate. No obligations to share your work. If you are comfortable with your work being photographed, I would like to post it on the group pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4) How much is it?&nbsp;<br>*** It\u2019s $20 at the door, $15 in advance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5) Can I model?&nbsp;<br>*** You are more than welcome to model. Take turns! Ideally, if we're all naked, we all stand an opportunity as model if we so desire. The only rule I have is you must be nude to pose. That is sort of the point, after all.<\/p>\n<p>6) What do I bring?&nbsp;<br>*** Bring supplies and booze. I will provide some art supplies for those without, but I'm afraid I can not supply free booze. But hey, tip generously and I'll think about it ;P&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>7) Can I take photos?&nbsp;<br>*** Nope. You can draw pictures, but you can\u2019t snap them. Why, you might ask? It's kinda creepy, in a room full of naked strangers, to pull out your camera. Even if you ask, putting one \"No\" on the spot in a room full of \"Yes\" is the sort of intimidation and alienation I'm hoping to avoid. Respect this rule, please. Don't be a creep.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>8) Who can come?&nbsp;<br>*** Anyone! with some conditions&nbsp;<br>-If I do not know you, and we have never spoken, shoot me a message first. Let me know who you are before you enter my home.<br>-If you want to bring a guest or three, let me know.&nbsp;<br>-If you want to come but not get naked, I think you may find one of the other hundreds of NY drawing groups a bit more your speed.<\/p>\n<p>9) Anything else I should know?&nbsp;<br>***This is a safe space with supportive people and a free and encouraging energy. While people will be naked, don't just assume that's license to read someone's ass like it's brail. Please be respectful, consensual adults. If you start to creep people out, you leave. Also, please be quiet in the stairwell. My neighbors are real sweet people, you guys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>10) Where is it?&nbsp;<br>*** &nbsp;Ocean ave at Parkside Ave in Brooklyn. Parkside ave Q stop. Three buildings from the subway, on Ocean, across from the park. The address will be sent out the day before the event.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>11) My boyfriend is not comfortable with me coming to this thing. Is this a sex party?&nbsp;<br>*** This is my home. Keep sexpectations to a minimum, and know the line between sex and sexy. We also have couples come to every event. If your significant other is jealous, bring them! That said, if anything grows while you pose, don't sweat it. Appreciate it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>12) How many people will be there? Will it be crowded?&nbsp;<br>*** I'm saying maximum capacity is 30. Won't be crowded.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>13) What kind of poses are we doing?&nbsp;<br>*** ENTIRELY up to you. You can go anywhere from Venus De Milo modesty to spred out and comfy. We're just naked people sketching naked people. For the first few hours we'll be working with short poses. After that we'll move on to longer poses. You can do couple\/group long poses or individual 10 minute poses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>If you have questions feel free to call or text me at 347.409.1220<\/p>","lon":-73.9199981689,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/highres_449555591.jpeg","photo_id":449555591,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/600_449555591.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/b\/0\/7\/thumb_449555591.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":203633253,"name":"Nick Stryker","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/highres_256034501.jpeg","photo_id":256034501,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/member_256034501.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/8\/a\/5\/thumb_256034501.jpeg"}},"members":92,"name":"Naked Drink N Draw (NDND) - All Genders!","id":19905160,"state":"NY","urlname":"NDNDAG","category":{"name":"alternative lifestyle","id":17,"shortname":"lifestyle"},"lat":40.6699981689,"who":"Artists"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462154457000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"punk","name":"Punk","id":450},{"urlkey":"straightedge","name":"Straight Edge","id":1683},{"urlkey":"hardcore","name":"Hardcore","id":3252},{"urlkey":"nondrinker","name":"Alcohol-Free","id":7174},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"punk-rock","name":"Punk Rock","id":16196},{"urlkey":"ladies","name":"Ladies","id":18333},{"urlkey":"female-empowerment","name":"Female Empowerment","id":24461},{"urlkey":"female","name":"Female","id":26399},{"urlkey":"sober-activities","name":"Sober Activities","id":46200}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/New-York-Straight-Edge-Ladies-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Looking to get a straight edge ladies crew started in NYC!

As she grew, she fell in love with the outdoors and people from different cultures. Her passion brought her to places she never imagined she would explore...the jungle villages of Belize, the coasts of West Africa, and the deserts of Arizona. It is in Arizona, in a small national park, where she vowed to start a lifetime adventure with her forever-partner Dan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maria and Dan led a life full of wild outdoor adventures...their favorite place to be together was anywhere under the stars. Fast forward nine years and three kids later, Maria and Dan now call Long Beach, NY their home. They found living a more urban lifestyle in NY created new types of adventure; however, living by the beach offered a home with a nature escape close by. While building their careers and family, time spent exploring their wild earth seemed to be a distant memory.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One day, while driving up an off-ramp of 495 LIE, wild thing #2 yelled, \"Woohoo! We are climbing a mountain.\" As they reached the top of the ramp, wild thing #1 yelled, \"We are ON TOP OF THE WORLD!\" Maria and Dan looked at each other in disbelief that THEIR beautiful, sweet offspring thought that THIS ramp was a mountain! They realized that in the business of life, they were not sharing some of their deepest passions with their children. It was a turning point for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maria and Dan made it a point to get outdoors with their kids and seek new wild experiences. Their most recent adventure took them through the ancient redwood forest and along the coast of Northern California. Returning home from their trip they realize that TIME spent outdoors together was uplifting and priceless. They decided to start \"Into the Wild\" because adventures in nature can be found even in your own backyard. They hope to connect with other families who love nature and desire to give their children more sunshine and less screen time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Come join us and get Into the Wild!<\/p>","lon":-73.6600036621,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/e\/4\/highres_449586116.jpeg","photo_id":449586116,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/e\/4\/600_449586116.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/7\/e\/4\/thumb_449586116.jpeg"},"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":204384535,"name":"Maria Detherage","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/b\/e\/5\/highres_256207141.jpeg","photo_id":256207141,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/b\/e\/5\/member_256207141.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/1\/b\/e\/5\/thumb_256207141.jpeg"}},"members":115,"name":"Into the Wild: Long Beach Family Adventures","id":19905615,"state":"NY","urlname":"Into-the-Wild-Long-Beach-Family-Adventures","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.5900001526,"who":"Wild Things"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Rego Park","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462162499000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"newintown","name":"New In Town","id":1273},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"women","name":"Women's Social","id":10232},{"urlkey":"girlfriends","name":"Girlfriends","id":15144},{"urlkey":"desis","name":"Desis","id":15261},{"urlkey":"girls-night-out","name":"Girls' Night Out","id":16550},{"urlkey":"performing-arts","name":"Performing Arts","id":17558},{"urlkey":"live-theatre","name":"Theater","id":23274},{"urlkey":"cultural-activities","name":"Cultural Activities","id":23884},{"urlkey":"professional-women","name":"Professional Women","id":26273},{"urlkey":"indian-culture","name":"Indian Culture","id":27904},{"urlkey":"desi-girls","name":"Desi girls","id":28333},{"urlkey":"queens","name":"Queens","id":85799},{"urlkey":"ladies-meeting-ladies","name":"Ladies meeting ladies","id":1171272}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Rego-Park-Other-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Hoping to connect with other&nbsp;&nbsp;ladies like myself who are genuinely interested in making friends.

We are an independent group of friends and would be friends who enjoy walking and hiking together. It is designed for people who are fit and in reasonably good shape and who want to get some exercise and learn more about New York City. New York City Hiking Tours is \u201cmore walk and less talk. The hikes and walks vary in length from 4-10 miles and can last anywhere from 2-6 hours or so. These events are fairly fast paced although I will stop on occasion a number of times to talk very briefly about what we see. We cover a lot of ground at a reasonably steady pace and the goal is to see as much of a specific area in New York City as possible.&nbsp;It is my hope that on each and every hiking tour you will not only experience something that will give you a sense of wonder and excitement but you will enjoy yourself as well.<\/p>\n<p>I plan on visiting and exploring many different areas in New York City. For example, I really enjoy exploring Central Park (I have guidebooks from the 1860\u2019s), the lower Manhattan Waterfront, Riverside Park, Prospect Park, Williamsburg, Vinegar Hill, DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Chelsea and the Meat Packing District where I am familiar with a number of art galleries there, Roosevelt Island, Governors Island, Long Island City etc. etc. I tend to focus on certain areas and know some of these areas better than others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;I make it a point to insure that the hikes and walks I lead are a lot of fun. BUT and this is a big BUT, I take the RSVP process very seriously and expect that any participant should do the same. I will often limit registration to keep the group size manageable and I do not like to keep a \u201cWait List\u201d for a lengthy period of time. I want you to be able to plan your day in advance and I want to be able to plan the event as well. If you RSVP for an event and are a \u201cNo Show\u201d and you do not have a good reason for not showing up, I am going to simply delete you from the group. If you make it a habit of withdrawing your RSVP shortly before an event begins, I am also going to delete you from the group. Meeting Details will only be provided to those who RSVP and will not be publicized on the website. I\u2019m just asking that people be considerate to me and the others in the Group and that every one act responsibly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Any activity that I lead for New York City Hiking Tours will be FREE. However, as an Organizer I have to pay Meetup so you are always welcome to give a donation of one or two dollars or whatever you want at the beginning or end of an event.<\/p>","lon":-73.8499984741,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":67975422,"name":"Bruce","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/0\/highres_79800832.jpeg","photo_id":79800832,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/0\/member_79800832.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/3\/4\/0\/thumb_79800832.jpeg"}},"members":312,"name":"New York City Hiking Tours","id":19908188,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Hiking-Tours","category":{"name":"outdoors\/adventure","id":23,"shortname":"outdoors-adventure"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Hikers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"New York","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462216226000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"investing","name":"Investing","id":1307},{"urlkey":"financialchaos","name":"Financial Chaos","id":1731},{"urlkey":"retirement","name":"Investing for Retirement","id":6364},{"urlkey":"financial-planning","name":"Financial Planning","id":15222},{"urlkey":"financial-literacy","name":"Financial Literacy","id":15503},{"urlkey":"financial-independence","name":"Financial Independence","id":16601},{"urlkey":"financial-health-literacy","name":"Financial Health & Literacy","id":16840},{"urlkey":"financial-freedom","name":"Financial Freedom","id":16899},{"urlkey":"financial-education","name":"Financial Education","id":18341},{"urlkey":"success-through-financial-literacy","name":"Success through Financial Literacy","id":19150},{"urlkey":"courses-and-workshops","name":"Courses and Workshops","id":20629},{"urlkey":"finance","name":"Finance","id":22467},{"urlkey":"personal-finance","name":"Personal Finance","id":22979},{"urlkey":"trading","name":"Trading","id":26906},{"urlkey":"creating-financial-freedom","name":"Creating financial freedom","id":33127}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Yope-Financial-Literacy-Workshops\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>There are lots of apps and online literature out there about personal finance.

Bike touring is a wonderful way to travel and see the world. But you don't always have to go very far, or go away for a long time to experience it. In fact, there are many places close by to the New York Metro Region that are perfect for 1- or 2-night bike trips where you either camp or stay in a hotel. You can also do many longer distance one-day rides with friends that can take you to a local winery or microbrewery where you can enjoy the effort it took to get there with a drink and a nice meal. <br><\/p>\n<p>This meet up group is sponsored by Gotham Bicycle Tours, which is a local bike touring company that organizes 1- and 2-night bike tours along with wine and beer-tasting day rides for people looking to escape the city. While many of the listings are tours you can take with Gotham Bicycle Tours, this meet-up group is also intended to be a forum for individuals to meet other people to do their own bicycle adventures. Perhaps you have a lot of camping experience and you aren't an avid cyclist? Or perhaps you've done lots of cycling, but need help coming up with an overnight tour idea.

We want to create a forum, where we support each other and our children during this stressful time.","lon":-74,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":96644082,"name":"Salil Sethi","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/9\/b\/highres_256329371.jpeg","photo_id":256329371,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/9\/b\/member_256329371.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/4\/9\/b\/thumb_256329371.jpeg"}},"members":15,"name":"New York Parents of High Schoolers Meetup","id":19925786,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Parents-of-High-Schoolers-Meetup","category":{"name":"parents\/family","id":25,"shortname":"parents-family"},"lat":40.7200012207,"who":"Members"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Bronx","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462643710000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"quilting","name":"Quilting","id":229},{"urlkey":"learn-to-quilt","name":"Learn to Quilt","id":21611},{"urlkey":"art-quilting","name":"Art Quilting","id":23954},{"urlkey":"machine-quilting","name":"Machine Quilting","id":45475},{"urlkey":"quilters","name":"Quilters","id":62539},{"urlkey":"quilting-for-fun","name":"Quilting for Fun","id":63901},{"urlkey":"quilting-for-beginners-and-experianced-persons","name":"Quilting for Beginners and Experianced Persons","id":63902},{"urlkey":"designing-and-making-quilts","name":"Designing and Making Quilts","id":63904},{"urlkey":"meeting-friends-while-quilting","name":"Meeting Friends while Quilting","id":63905},{"urlkey":"hand-quilting","name":"Hand Quilting","id":90409},{"urlkey":"modern-quilting","name":"modern quilting","id":134146},{"urlkey":"machine-or-hand-piecing-and-quilting","name":"Machine or hand piecing and quilting","id":150964},{"urlkey":"meet-and-discuss-quilting","name":"Meet and discuss quilting","id":165878}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bronx-Southern-Westchester-Quilting-Meetup\/","rating":0,"description":"I am a new quilter and would love to meet others interested in quilting and socializing.

Reiki (pronounced ray-key) is a form of energy healing that is deeply relaxing and promotes the healing of the mind,body, and spirit. The best way to understand Reiki is to breakdown the Japanese kanji: Rei mean Spiritual Wisdom and Ki means Life Energy. So, Reiki means Spiritually Guided Life Energy. Ki is found is all different languages and cultures; in Sanskrit, it is prana, in Chineses it is Chi, and by scientists it is bioenergy field. Reiki is a very special type of Ki that always knows what is good for your best and highest healing because Reiki practitioners do not direct Ki but hold space for Divine Wisdom to guide the Ki. Reiki is done by either light touch or no-touch techniques with the goal of increasing our flow of Ki which causes us to feel better.

A way of life and a set of guiding principles and practical tools for everyday living to transform key areas of your life. A framework for deep self-exploration for each of us to craft our very own extraordinary life.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me, you experienced that by the time we reach our 40s, 50s, and 60s most women seem to be getting a very strong urge to live a more authentic life \u2013 one more in alignment with their heart\u2019s desires. You know the saying: You become like the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. You also become like the people who challenge and support you. This community is committed to success \u2014 to supporting and challenging one another. &nbsp;I\u2019m on this grand adventure, growing and expanding to live an epic life and nothing less. I\u2019m pushing myself and journeying beyond the confines of daily life into terrains of wonder, kindness, acceptance, revelation, delight and transformation to do some pretty awesome things. I want to help inspire and motivate other women to do the same in their life. &nbsp;My greatest gift to you would be to collapse your timeline so you don\u2019t spend another year, five years or another decade trying to figure this all out on your own and without the support and accountability that are crucial elements of success. My mission is to change the conversation around middle aged women. This is a new life phase, a tremendous opportunity for reinvention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whatever it is you are looking to do: write a book, start a business, get healthy and fit once and for all, find a life partner, or just explore and create, surrounding yourself with a community that is willing and able to help you is priceless. My role is to be organizer, strategist, facilitator and connector of human potential. This meetup is based out of Paramus, NJ (my current hometown). Monthly meetups will take place at various locations in Rockland and Bergen counties and maybe NYC.<\/p>\n<p><span>A few rules:<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Please use a facial photo in your profile.

After 3 no-shows, you will be removed from the group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Inactive members are removed from the group after 3 months of no activity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;We ask that attendees please not use our events to promote their business\/products, services.

We will aim to have interesting discussions about what we each value in a community which may lead  us to explore new neighborhoods.\n\nEach guided neighborhood experience will last from 2-3 hours and may include brief stops at local businesses, cafes, green space, and other points of interest to get a more intimate flavor of the neighborhood. Members may make requests and suggestions for future meetups, and we can venture into more obscure sections of the city.\n\nThe group leader, Hank Orenstein, is a licensed NYC Tour Guide, urban historian, visual artist, retired social worker - and also a real estate broker with The Corcoran Group.  The leader will impart his knowledge of the real estate market to provide practical information for members who wish to gain more knowledge of current and future housing stock in each neighborhood.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":79290392,"name":"Hank Orenstein","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/9\/2\/highres_245311634.jpeg","photo_id":245311634,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/9\/2\/member_245311634.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/7\/b\/9\/2\/thumb_245311634.jpeg"}},"members":48,"name":"Thinking of Moving?

It will show you how to live in a healthy and loving way during the grieving process and this temporary separation. We will do guided meditations to be able to sense the presence of your loved one and know that love never dies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is not a mediumship development group and does not require mediumistic ability; it is for anyone who is grieving and wants the reassurance that there is no separation and that the human spirit survives the transition we call death.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"approval","organizer":{"member_id":13188870,"name":"Karen Frances","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/highres_243801950.jpeg","photo_id":243801950,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/member_243801950.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/5\/5\/b\/e\/thumb_243801950.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"NYC Healing Grief with Mediumship","id":19940582,"state":"NY","urlname":"NYC-Healing-Grief-with-Mediumship","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"lat":40.75,"who":"Seekers"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Eastchester","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1462987370000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"knitting","name":"Knitting","id":212},{"urlkey":"sewing","name":"Sewing","id":1111},{"urlkey":"needlework","name":"Needlework","id":1666},{"urlkey":"homedecorating","name":"Home Decorating","id":1674},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"craftswap","name":"Crafts","id":10099},{"urlkey":"handmade-crafts","name":"Handmade Crafts","id":16459},{"urlkey":"paper-crafts","name":"Paper Crafts","id":17320},{"urlkey":"fabric-crafts","name":"Fabric Crafts","id":21827},{"urlkey":"coffee-tea-while-knitting","name":"Coffee\/Tea While Knitting","id":21868},{"urlkey":"knitting-for-beginners","name":"Knitting for Beginners","id":27212},{"urlkey":"makers","name":"Makers","id":43887},{"urlkey":"sewing-for-beginners","name":"Sewing for Beginners","id":50364},{"urlkey":"jewellery-making","name":"Jewellery Making","id":83198}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Westchester-DIY-Crafts-MeetUp\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Calling all crafters!

Meeting for drinks and food, together we will wrestle with ideas around theology, spirituality, justice, peace, hope, life, death, politics, faith, mercy, love, and more. We hope to learn from one another, to grow in relationship with God, and to figure out ways we can work for justice and wholeness in our community and in the world. \n\nWhile this meetup is sponsored by the Presbyterian Church (USA), those of us organizing the meetup recognize that we have more questions than answers about religion and spirituality. We are messy and imperfect and yet we believe the mess is what makes us beautiful and interesting.  We aren't looking for answers but for those who will accompany us on this journey of learning and life. \n\nYou are invited to join our conversation.  Whether you are still connected to a particular religious tradition, have walked away from religion altogether, are spiritual but not religious, are questioning, or simply want an imperfect community of people who will challenge you to be open to God, you are invited.

You spend too much time on your computer. You spend too much time in the office. You should work out but you don't make the time and your life looks and feels the same every day. You need a change in perspective.<\/p>\n<p>One year ago, my wife and I went for a walk. I was too busy and didn't want to go. I had too much work to do and I was inactive and flabby. She encouraged me to try it anyway so I did. It lasted 5.34 miles. At the end, I was exhausted physically, but mentally stimulated beyond belief! It was the best thing I could have done and so I kept going. By the end of that first month, I walked 47.1 miles--mostly on my own.<\/p>\n<p>As an entrepreneur, these walks have helped me grow as a person and a professional. I have a unique perspective that balances my tech-heavy work with the outdoors and nature. I think more clearly and apply my clarity to better focus at work. While I don't take daily walks, I do walk every week--rain or shine. If I can do it, you can do it. Perhaps all you need is a coach to get you started.<\/p>\n<p>One year later and 330.2 miles walked, I am happier, healthier and have a new appreciation for my life and my work. In this time, I have discovered many great paths and would like to invite you to join me in kicking off your own journey of self-discovery. In the process, you will meet new friends, network and push yourself beyond your habitual limits.<\/p>\n<p>Please share this Meetup with friends who are entrepreneurs, small business owners and professionals; your influence could change their lives.<\/p>","lon":-73.9899978638,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/5\/0\/highres_450082352.jpeg","photo_id":450082352,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/5\/0\/600_450082352.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/7\/5\/0\/thumb_450082352.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":122588842,"name":"Sean P.

You are not charged ahead of time. That is, you pay as you go. If you take 1 class, you only pay for that class. This way, you do not have to pay if you missed one class. Classes are affordable and offer a longer duration for the price. That is, Each class is one hour and a half instead of just one hour. You will learn Salsa on2, New York Style, which is what is danced in New York city and other places. So come out and finally learn how to dance salsa.

business professionals interested in 3D printing and learning about how it can be implemented in their businesses today and in the future. Although the landscape is changing there's still not enough resources for first time professionals who want to add 3D Printing or Additive Manufacturing into their business workflow. Whether you already have a printer and are simply looking to learn more about use cases or if you are just starting your exploration into 3D printing, this Meetup is for you. For our in-person sessions in NYC, we want everyone to have the chance to get hands-on experience with a 3D printer and focused trainings on how to go from having a great idea to producing a physical object. We offer live webinars as well so those who cannot make our in-person classes can still learn. In our classes we teach members how a 3D printer works, answer questions, and guide them through the process of creating their first print. No supplies, experience or expertise needed. For those looking for more advanced insights into 3D printing we have some of the most knowledgable professionals from across the industry. Our instructors expertise include CAD\/CAM Design, Polyjet Technologies, FDM Technologies, and insights on how different businesses from across the world are using 3D printing to prototype, produce, and improve their go-to-market strategies. You should join our group if you are interested in learning about 3D printing, meeting other 3D printing professional users, or generally understanding how 3D printing is being used in different industries today. If you have any projects, ideas or tricks for 3D Printing you'd like to discuss please share them with the group as well!

Networking leads to business referrals which are THE fastest way to grow your business. Over 98% of businesses get business from referrals, yet only 3% of those businesses have a plan to consistently get those referrals. Are you ready to join the 3%? For 30 years BNI has used a simple but elegant philosophy that exemplifies membership, \"Givers Gain.\" Whether you're new to BNI or have some experience, chances are you've never seen anything like Revenue Raisers before. We're 28 (and growing) highly motivated, enthusiastic and generous professionals that genuinely care about each other and growing each others business from consistent warm referrals. Our members span from fields as diverse as real estate, legal, marketing, finance, and health and wellness. Best of all, we only allow one person per profession. If your profession isn't yet represented in our chapter, you could quickly become the go-to guy or gal. Imagine what having 28+ hungry salespeople looking for new business for you around the clock could do for your business. Are you our next success story? RSVP to our next meeting (Thursdays at 9:30am) and see for yourself how BNI can change your business and your life for the better. Because, who couldn't use a smoking hot referral RIGHT NOW?!

You will also need to be prepared to tell the room who you are, what you do, and who a perfect referral for you would be. The more specific you are in asking for the referral the greater chance you have in receiving that life changing referral on the spot.<\/p>","lon":-74,"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/6\/9\/highres_450332361.jpeg","photo_id":450332361,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/6\/9\/600_450332361.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/e\/6\/9\/thumb_450332361.jpeg"},"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":153186592,"name":"Marie Ingrisano Isner","photo":{"photo_id":206739442,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/a\/1\/2\/member_206739442.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/9\/a\/1\/2\/thumb_206739442.jpeg"}},"members":11,"name":"BNI Confidence Weekly Networking Meeting","id":19988165,"state":"NY","urlname":"BNI-Confidence-Weekly-Networking-Meeting","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.6800003052,"who":"Businessmen and women"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public","city":"Englewood","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1464046993000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"latinmusic","name":"Latin Music","id":130},{"urlkey":"salsa","name":"Salsa","id":1122},{"urlkey":"bachata","name":"Bachata","id":20160},{"urlkey":"social-dancing","name":"Social Dancing","id":24854},{"urlkey":"bachata-dominican-style","name":"Bachata Dominican Style","id":63200},{"urlkey":"dancing-bachata","name":"Dancing Bachata","id":63426},{"urlkey":"bachata-dancing","name":"Bachata dancing","id":87267},{"urlkey":"bachata-socials","name":"Bachata Socials","id":107937}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bergen-Bachata\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Do you love to dance bachata?

Initially the group will be limited to Caucasian women and Afro American men and women as this seems to be a nearly IMPOSSIBLE group to establish. I don't think I've ever actually seen an Afro American woman at a nudist camp. We need to change this! If successful, we will broaden the invite to include others. Both nudism and clothing optional is permitted. There is a dearth of groups that cater specifically to the over 50's crowd that enjoy both the concept behind naturism, and when they exist, they are horribly segregated by race and gender and usually over represented by white Caucasian men. Hence my brilliant idea for this group. :)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Oftentimes, older people feel intimidated by younger, fitter nude bodies and hopefully this group will offer a welcome alternative to that atmosphere. No body judging in this group! Naturism is about celebrating the loveliness of us all and how the variations inspire awe and respect. All types are welcome as long as they are honest, fun loving and most important- intelligent. This group has absolutely nothing to do with sexuality. To anyone conversant with naturism, nudity is anything but sexual. It brings everyone down to the same, happy level of openness, vulnerability and sharing.<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>Activities will be both indoors and out, weather permitting, and are all about socializing.

Each presentation will be followed by up to 90 minutes of networking and group discussions about Corporate wellbeing, employee engagement and related HR best practices.","lon":-73.9899978638,"join_mode":"open","organizer":{"member_id":7481797,"name":"Nancy","photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/b\/a\/highres_256870938.jpeg","photo_id":256870938,"photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/b\/a\/member_256870938.jpeg","thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/member\/2\/a\/b\/a\/thumb_256870938.jpeg"}},"members":14,"name":"New York Corporate Wellbeing & Employee Engagement Meetup","id":19995915,"state":"NY","urlname":"New-York-Corporate-Wellbeing-Employee-Engagement-Meetup","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Wellbeing enthusiasts"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"country":"US","visibility":"public_limited","city":"Woodside","timezone":"US\/Eastern","created":1464204267000,"topics":[{"urlkey":"workathome","name":"Work At Home","id":589},{"urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking","id":4422},{"urlkey":"freelance","name":"Freelance","id":9876},{"urlkey":"social","name":"Social","id":10581},{"urlkey":"activities","name":"Activities","id":15116},{"urlkey":"fun-times","name":"Fun Times","id":15117},{"urlkey":"weekday-actitivies","name":"Weekday Actitivies","id":16479},{"urlkey":"new-york-city","name":"New York City","id":16809},{"urlkey":"make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life","name":"Make New Friends","id":17225},{"urlkey":"matinee","name":"Matinee","id":18404},{"urlkey":"nyc","name":"NYC","id":39508},{"urlkey":"hangout","name":"Hangout","id":62663},{"urlkey":"weekday-daytime-social-group","name":"Weekday Daytime Social Group","id":80232},{"urlkey":"daytime-activities","name":"Daytime Activities","id":97507},{"urlkey":"shift-workers-seeking-new-day-friends","name":"SHIFT WORKERS SEEKING NEW DAY FRIENDS","id":140433}],"link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/9-to-5-Friends\/","rating":0,"description":"<p>Hi there, my name is Alan and I created this group hoping to find other people like me who are free to do fun activities during the day on weekdays.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Going to matinee shows with no lines and having the whole theater to yourself; trying the lunch specials at good, hard-to-get-in restaurants; seeing your favorite celebrities at live tapings of talk shows\u2014these are just some of the great things that NYC has to offer during the day.
