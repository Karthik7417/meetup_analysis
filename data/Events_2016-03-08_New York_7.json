In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which Don approaches all things, he designs the Wife Project to find his perfect partner: a sixteen-page, scientifically valid survey to filter out the drinkers, the smokers, the late arrivers.

Jersey City is now offering a weekly poetry workshop.\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThis workshop will start by critiquing 3-4 poems, one by each person signed up ahead of time. The workshop will end, if time permits, with one 10 minute writing prompt (an idea to incorporate into a poem written on the spot). \u00a0Poets who sign up to be workshopped must bring printed copies of their poems for the group (recommended: 10 copies). To sign up for a workshop in advance, please contact Sarah Jewell at [masked].\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nWhile workshopping poems, we will \u201cmind our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s\u201d by Praising first what works in a poem, and then Questioning what might be improved. This helps to keep the feedback positive and constructive. If you are new to critiquing poetry, please see these guidelines:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/triadwriters.org\/inspiration\/guidelines-critique-of-poem\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/triadwriters.org\/inspiration\/guidelines-critique-of-poem\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p> <p>\n\n\nThe workshop will be held in an upstairs room in the Brightside Tavern (upon arrival, go up the stairs to your left).

A grandfather (occasionally it\u2019s a grandmother) imparting a life lesson to his grandson tells him, \"I have two wolves fighting in my heart. One wolf is vengeful, fearful, envious, resentful, deceitful. The other wolf is loving, compassionate, generous, truthful, and serene.\" The grandson asks which wolf will win the fight. The grandfather answers, \"The one I feed.\u201d\u00a0<\/p> <p>\u2015\u00a0Sharon Salzberg,\u00a0Real Happiness: The Power of Meditation<\/p> <p>Hello\u00a0John, \u00a0<\/p> <p>Hope you've had a good week. \u00a0We will continue our investigation of Mindfulness tomorrow and take a look at emotions and our relationship to them.<\/p> <p>Working with emotions can be tricky for many of us. We fear being carried away or controlled by them. Often we create stories with rationalizations, causes and blame to help us stay far away from the emotion itself. We opt to just live with the discomfort in our hearts or in the places where they have left traces or pain or even sickness in our bodies.<\/p> <p>What can we do instead? Well, with practice, as soon as emotional energy begins to rise, we can take a beat, a pause, before our stories begin. \u00a0Then, setting the stories aside, free of the added intensity they add, we can turn our attention to the emotion itself, by itself. How does the emotion feel? Where am I feeling it in my body? Leaving the story out doesn't mean it won't sometimes be painful to be with the energy of emotions, but we will have disarmed a good portion of the optional suffering the stories provide.<\/p> <p>In meditation it's important to focus our attention on all of the emotions that arise in their basic, energetic state.\u00a0 Any time we leave an emotion out of our awareness, it doesn't really go away. The emotional parts of ourselves we ignore or push away because we don't like them or don't want to deal with them become an low-level, but constant buzz in our ears that overtime can become destabilizing or corrosive.<\/p> <p>It's also helpful to remember that everyone has to deal with emotions. It's important because in a way we can know it's not personal and it's not a moral failing. \u00a0We can begin to see our emotions are part of the human experience. \u00a0We can get curious about them without judgment.\u00a0 We can treat ourselves with compassion and kindness.<\/p> <p><b>Foundations of Mindfulness<\/b> Mindfulness is more than just paying attention. It is powered by intention, but we also have to get out of our own way to experience clearly what\u2019s actually appearing. We have to find an openness of heart and mind and suspend our judgements and theories and rationales so we can see more than what we always see. We have to begin to relinquish the \"I\" and \"mine\" kinds of ownership over what arises in our experience. We also have to unhook from the time line that may bind us to the past or project us to the future and be mindful now.<\/p> <p>Over the next few weeks we will explore of the traditional Foundations of Mindfulness.<\/p> <p>Introduction to Mindfulness<br\/>Mindfulness of the Breath<br\/>Mindfulness of the Body<br\/>Mindfulness of Emotions<br\/>Mindfulness of Thinking<br\/>Mindfulness of the Mind<br\/>Mindfulness in Daily Life<\/p> <p>I hope you'll share your Saturday morning with us.<\/p> <p><b>Class Structure: \u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>Each class begins with a very brief guided meditation of gathering and quieting followed by a\u00a0topical teaching and an expanded guided mindfulness meditation.

Details below:<\/p> <p>Join us for an exciting Pok\u00e9mon Celebration on 2\/27! The New Nintendo 3DS Pok\u00e9mon 20th Anniversary Edition will be available along with exclusive Pok\u00e9mon 20th merchandise. Event festivities will start at 11AM. We will have game demoes, Pok\u00e9mon themed activities, a photo booth, giveaways and more. Pikachu will be here to take photos with fans. Color-coded wristbands will be distributed at 9AM to those waiting in line to attend the event. The wristbands will designate what time attendees can enter the celebration. There will be five<br\/>time slots for entry. Each time slot will allow guests one hour to participate in the event. The last two hours of the event will allow guests who did not receive a wristband to enter.<\/p> <p>9AM : New Nintendo 3DS Pok\u00e9mon 20th Anniversary Edition &amp; Pok\u00e9mon 20th merchandise will go on sale<br\/>11AM - 12PM : First time slot open to attendees with color coded wristbands<br\/>12PM - 1PM : Second time slot open to attendees with color coded wristbands<br\/>1PM - 2PM : Third time slot open to attendees with color coded wristbands<br\/>2PM - 3PM : Fourth time slot open to attendees with color coded wristbands<br\/>3PM - 5PM : Guests who did not receive a wristband may attend during this time<\/p> <p>However, that doesn't mean the fun will stop, because after their event ends, our TOURNAMENT begins!!!<\/p> <p>That's right, we said TOURNAMENT! Full disclosure: We wanted to do a tournament of only the original 151 Pokemon, but The Pokemon Company beat us to the punch with it's Kanto Classic Online Competition! So our tournament will use the same rules as the Kanto Classic, with one slight addition: #150, Mewtwo, and #151, Mew, will be allowed in our version! So bring your teams and test 'em out at our event!

My Website<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.simondeacon.com\/<\/a> Vortex Healing\u00ae is a energy therapy modality that works with divine healing energy and divine consciousness that is channeled through my being into the client. When this happens a form of multi-dimensional healing occurs that becomes literally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and even karmically transformational. Vortex Healing\u00ae works directly from the realm of divine consciousness. When you receive a healing you receive from a multitude of energetic and divine frequencies simultaneously. There are many levels to our consciousness, some containing the deepest and hardest to reach levels of negative conditioning, karma, and trauma. Vortex Healing\u00ae reaches all these levels. Vortex Healing\u00ae creates powerful and accelerated healing for the deepest of blocks, negative patterns and emotional trauma. It heals and transforms the very fabric of your reality. All negativity, disharmony, struggle, and even negative karma fall away to bring about incredible breakthroughs, freedom from the deepest of trauma, and a great opening to the flow of fulfillment and abundance. The divine frequencies used can reprogram core belief systems and negative emotional patterns that will bring more harmony and fulfillment both in your inner and outer reality. It also releases the illusion of separation consciousness, so each healing session brings you even deeper into your most highest divine expression. Hope to see you there!

We'll also be looking at some of the newer buildings including\u00a0a\u00a0salmon-colored stucco palazzo,\u00a0Mediterrean-style\u00a0palaces with red Spanish tiled roofs,\u00a0Afghan Mosque made partly of mable, Greek Orthodox Church with multiple round domes,\u00a0Korean Buddhist Temple made of wood, and\u00a0Russian Orthodox Church with an onion-shaped blue dome.<\/p> <p>The neighborhood of Malba doesn't have any commercial establishments, multi-family homes,\u00a0or public transportation; therefore,\u00a0people living in Malba usually travel around by automobile or boat\/yacht.\u00a0Some call Malba the \"Beverly Hills of the East Coast.\" We'll first look at some of the houses in Northern Flushing and then head to Whitestone, which has some lovely Victorian-era houses and new\u00a0churches. However, we'll have to walk (about 15 to 20\u00a0blocks)\u00a0through a mostly ordinary-looking\u00a0section of Whitestone\u00a0to get to an interesting section of\u00a0Whitestone and ritzy Malba.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> The cost of this event is $2 per person, which is paid at the start of the walk. This is for the organizer\u2019s Meetup preparation costs and fees.<\/p> <p><b>Meeting Time\/Place:<\/b>\u00a0 The meeting time is <i>(after lunch)<\/i> <b>at 1:45 PM<\/b>. The meeting place is <b>outside of the entrance to McDonalds Restaurant\u00a0at[masked] Roosevelt Avenue (on the north side of the street between Main Street and Union Street)<\/b>. Before the walk, restrooms are available in Macy's Department Store, which is\u00a0directly across the street from McDonald's Restaurant. The restrooms in Macy's are located on the second floor, next to the Shoe\/Sneaker Department.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation by subway:<\/b> <b>Take the No. 7 subway train to Main Street, Flushing. This is the last stop on the No. 7 train subway.<\/b>\u00a0Allow extra time because this train makes local stops to Main Street, Flushing.<\/p> <p><b>Public Transportation by the LIRR:<\/b> You can also take the Long Island Railroad from Nassau County to Flushing, Queens\u00a0<b>OR<\/b> the Long Island Railroad from Penn Station in Manhattan to Flushing, Queens.

At that point, we'll be taking a bus, the Q 44\u00a0(which is\u00a0a NYC bus) back to Main Street\/39th Avenue\u00a0in Flushing. The Q 44 has frequent service on Saturdays, running every 8 or 9 minutes.<\/p> <p>Because the Q 44 is a select bus service (SBS), passengers will have to pay the fare at a machine (which is at the bus stop) before boarding the bus and then get a receipt of payment from the machine. Paying the fare this way speeds up the boarding process. You can also buy a Metrocard at another machine located at this bus stop.<\/p> <p>The bus ride from 14th Avenue\/Parsons Boulevard to Main Street, Flushing takes about 14 minutes. You can then use the Metrocard to transfer from the city bus\u00a0\u00a0to the subway (No. 7 train). This is only\u00a0one fare.<\/p> <p>Rainy\/snowy weather or\u00a0cold\/windy conditions will\u00a0cancel this walk.

Anna\u2019s approach to the market is unique. She takes a three dimensional view, based on technical, fundamental and relational analysis. This powerful approach, when combined with price action and candle patterns, has given her a deep and detailed knowledge of the forces that drive the financial markets, which is then reflected in the underlying market sentiment.<\/p> <p><br\/>David Coulling day trades most markets including the indices, commodities and forex. David also develops and programs trading tools and indicators. Anna has written many books (all available on Amazon), but if you could read just one, she recommends \u2018A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis\u2019. The reason being is that once you have mastered this methodology, it can be applied to all markets and all instruments and will then underpin your approach to trading using other technical indicators. In other words, this is the foundation on which your trading analysis is built \u2013 everything else just helps confirm your analysis.<\/p> <p><br\/>In this TSAA-SF webinar, Anna and David will go over their trading approach and go into detail on how to use Volume Price Analysis (VPA) in your own trading.

Yet, although we concede that knowledge is power, most of us have only a rudimentary understanding of what we\u2019re in for when we go off in search of true love.\u00a0<\/p> <p>LOVE demystifies this all-important predictor of happiness, defining the nature of true love and outlining the commitment it takes to keep it alive. This telecourse is taught by two distinguished doctors: Dr. Pat Love, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and relationship consultant, and Dr. Jon Carlson, a university professor and Psychologist. Both instructors are practicing clinicians and have authored books and articles that have attracted national recognition. They challenge students to confront assumptions on the nature of love and to critically analyze the ideals perpetuated by popular culture in order to realize the wisdom it takes to find lasting love.\"<\/p> <p>Suggestions:<\/p> <p>A. Listen to understand while suspending judgment.<\/p> <p>B. Make one point at a time and allow others to respond. Speak from personal experience.<\/p> <p>C. Identify the underlying assumptions. Look for new insights.<\/p> <p>Note \u2013 Meetup nor the participants neither screens participants, nor supervises or controls meetings, and we have no special involvement with any of the individuals who participate.

We learn about famous pieces\u2014from Michelangelo\u2019s Cupid to Picasso\u2019s portrait of Gertrude Stein\u2014but in addition we explore lesser-known artists and works that are often ignored. And we delve into the fascinating forms of homosexuality in other cultures, such as same-sex initiation rites in New Guinea, represented in the Met\u2019s Oceania collection. It\u2019s all part of the hidden gay story in our city's great art museum, and I promise it will change your view of the Met!<\/p> <p>I apologize in advance for charging so much ($35 regular, $15 students and Met members) but sadly the museum charges a steep admission for group members.

This telecourse is taught by two distinguished doctors: Dr. Pat Love, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and relationship consultant, and Dr. Jon Carlson, a university professor and Psychologist. Both instructors are practicing clinicians and have authored books and articles that have attracted national recognition. They challenge students to confront assumptions on the nature of love and to critically analyze the ideals perpetuated by popular culture in order to realize the wisdom it takes to find lasting love.\"<\/p> <p>Suggestions:<\/p> <p>A.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713468\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713468","time":1456599600000,"updated":1456605122000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11237","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"135 Thames St.","name":"La Luz","lon":-73.927383,"id":12154822,"state":"NY","lat":40.70583,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.48819828033,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455215580000,"fee":{"amount":30,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/laluznyc.com\">La Luz<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireflysociety.guru\">Firefly Society<\/a> present a one of a kind immersive healing experience\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Sponsored by: The East Meets West Medicine Fest, Yarah Formation and Evolve and Ascend\u00a0<\/p> <p>To remove your stress and fatigue, your Winter blues.

Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers.<\/p> <p>Closest analogy I could come up with = a mix of basketball and football, but played with a frisbee.

Great minds, ideas and art crossed the strait of Gibraltar (Jabal Tariq) back and forth and created a rich mix that transcended the boundaries of religion, ethnicity and language. It is in this esthemus, this land in between, that giants such as Averroes, Maimonides, Alfonso El Sabio and Zyriab emerged. Thirteen centuries later, six musicians and dancers, who have been working together for a decade, strive to recreate this era through their music as immigrants in New York City. Both the time and the place of this encounter are significant as New York becomes the New Andalucia with an afternoon of convivencia.<\/p> <p><b>THE PERFORMERS of NEW ANDALUSIA<\/b>\u00a0<br\/>Alfonso Cid: Vocals, Flute and Caj\u00f3n<br\/>Arturo Mart\u00ednez: Guitar<br\/>B\u00e1rbara Mart\u00ednez: Vocals and Dance<br\/>Taoufiq Ben Amor: Vocals, Oud and Percussion<br\/>Ramzi Eledlebi: Percussion and Dance<br\/>Zafer Tawil: Oud and Violin<\/p> <p>For more information, contact the office at Good Shepherd,[masked], or email [masked]<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Reserved seating for performance, open seating at Soul Cafe afterwards","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club\/events\/228334933\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"Andalucian\/Arabic music: Flamenco at Art on the Corner!","id":"228334933","time":1456605000000,"updated":1456706112000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1291650343000,"name":"Bay Ridge Book, Game and Social Club","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":1747047,"urlname":"Bay-Ridge-Book-Game-and-Social-Club","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Bayside","address_1":"38-42, Ball Blvd","name":"Caffe Bene","lon":-73.772209,"id":24323371,"state":"NY","lat":40.765476,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.4716396332,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453637066000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><i>Join us for an exciting weekend filled with a bazaar &amp; open house for practitioners , therapists , yoga \u00a0teachers , yoga \u00a0studios , health colleges \u00a0from our experts \u00a0at the gorgeous Bayside . \u00a0Make \u00a0fun \u00a0loving \u00a0energetic \u00a0friends \u00a0and \u00a0shop at our resourceful holistic bazaar.\u00a0Bring your friends and family for this special event.

Great minds, ideas and art crossed the strait of Gibraltar (Jabal Tariq) back and forth and created a rich mix that transcended the boundaries of religion, ethnicity and language. It is in this esthemus, this land in between, that giants such as Averroes, Maimonides, Alfonso El Sabio and Zyriab emerged. Thirteen centuries later, six musicians and dancers, who have been working together for a decade, strive to recreate this era through their music as immigrants in New York City. Both the time and the place of this encounter are significant as New York becomes the New Andalucia with an afternoon of convivencia.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>THE PERFORMERS of NEW\u00a0ANDALUCIA\u00a0<\/b><br\/>Alfonso Cid: Vocals, Flute and Caj\u00f3n<br\/>Arturo Mart\u00ednez: Guitar<br\/>B\u00e1rbara Mart\u00ednez:\u00a0Vocals and Dance<br\/>Taoufiq Ben Amor: Vocals, Oud and Percussion<br\/>Ramzi Eledlebi: Percussion and Dance<br\/>Zafer Tawil: Oud and Violin<\/p> <p><br\/><i>For bios, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artonthecorner.org\/new-andalucia.html\">here<\/a>.<\/i><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Subway: R to 77 Street;  Bus: B4, B37, B63","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brooklyn-Live-Performance-Meetup-at-Art-on-the-Corner\/events\/228335838\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"See and hear Flamenco & Arabic music [and dancing!]","id":"228335838","time":1456606800000,"updated":1456677724000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1366254847000,"name":"The Brooklyn Live Performance Meetup @ Art on the Corner","group_lon":-74.0299987793,"id":8114962,"urlname":"Brooklyn-Live-Performance-Meetup-at-Art-on-the-Corner","group_lat":40.6199989319,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"176 Smith Street","name":"Red Star Sandwich Shop","lon":-73.991364,"id":24165285,"state":"NY","lat":40.685749,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":8,"headcount":0,"distance":4.44899177551,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456127901000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello, all you intermediates, let's get talking!

The Band doesn'tstart until closer to 9-9:30pm.\u00a0This is a non-stressful Saturday night out-Plenty of people to join dancing if your so moved and if not you will enjoy the company and a night out with live music. We get separate checks and they serve appetizers to full course meals. Terrific bread with oil and dried roasted peppers and lots of garlic.<\/p> <p>This is Stacey Gregg- I posted the flyer information regarding W2. Gina, Julie and Mariana will be hosting this wonderful event and Ash is attending as well. \u00a0I look forward to being able to meet up with you all very soon. This Saturday I have a Sweet 16 Birthday Party to attend and will not be able to make Marco Polo or Pavinci's. \u00a0I will be attending Every Thursday at \u00a0Charlie Browns and perhaps we can meetup there!

Our mission at satsearch is to build an independent, curated search tool for satellite parts that helps level out the playing field and resolves inefficiencies in the market. Developed by Kartik Kumar and Alberto Vaccarella, satsearch came out of Startup Weekend Space held in Bremen in April, 2015. The original idea for satsearch came from Kartik's frustration of not being able to easily find and compare satellite parts for preliminary mission design. Why can't we search, sort, filter and compare satellite parts like we can for laptops, cars and TVs? Kartik and Alberto realized quickly that this is a problem that can be solved. During Startup Weekend Space in Bremen, they discovered that the problem of spending hours \"Googling\" for parts resonates with engineers across the board.<\/p> <p><br\/>Currently, satsearch (<a href=\"https:\/\/satsearch.co\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/satsearch.co<\/a>) is in beta and Kartik and Alberto are looking for feedback. This presentation will focus on reviewing some of the problems in the space industry related to systems engineering, procurement and market analysis. Additionally, the talk will present some of the ideas being explored using satsearch to try to make it easier to design, build and operate satellites. Join us in our quest to open up the space industry!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"At the NYIT Incubator: Room 403, fourth floor, straight down the hallway.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NewSpace-NYC\/events\/228015120\/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":7200000,"name":"satsearch: moving towards a transparent space industry","id":"228015120","time":1456612200000,"updated":1456676681000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1311034937000,"name":"NewSpace NYC","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":2195371,"urlname":"NewSpace-NYC","group_lat":40.7200012207,"who":"astropreneurs"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"137 Greene Street","name":"Pomegranate Gallery","lon":-73.998932,"id":16524572,"state":"NY","lat":40.725861,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.73586988449,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454119116000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>InspiredWordNYC\u00a0&amp; PoetryTeachersNYC\u00a0present SPECIAL EDITION X; 10 NYC POETS, 10 NEW POETRY BOOKS @ the Pomegrante Gallery in downtown SoHo Manhattan - a book launch extravaganza of 10 poets handpicked by The Inspired Word and PTNYC and sponsored by Pomegranate Gallery Press.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe 10 poets who will be reading and selling signed books on this night, as well as the names of their new books, are:<\/p> <p>\n\nRich Alexandro - Unfazed in the teeth of a microscope<\/p> <p><br\/>Skye Cabrera - Meet Me At the Cube<\/p> <p><br\/>Rachel Brown - atop the staircase<\/p> <p><br\/>Jonathan Cherlin - Let's Go For A Walk<\/p> <p><br\/>Jennifer &amp; Patricia Harmon - Celebrating Sound<\/p> <p><br\/>Kevin Marquez - Towards the Question Mark<\/p> <p><br\/>Graham Wilner - Blashlight Flattery<\/p> <p>\n\n\nYi Wu - A Fistful of Moss and Poppy Seeds<\/p> <p><br\/>Jasmine Farrell - Pheonix Groomed as Genesis Doves<\/p> <p>\n\n\nYesenia Guerra - A Hike of the Self<\/p> <p>*****<br\/>Special Guest: Singer\/Songwriter Olithea<br\/>*****<\/p> <p>Discounted tickets (including a $6 Early Bird until Feb. 13 online via<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnycpoetrybooks.eventbrite.com%2F&amp;h=dAQGbrEYM&amp;enc=AZP-fzxrrC2GcPbmhRLyOchU1JZE1zjNC2OVJM5U0Kdi_5_vXPPAwQKuO5rr3gADX18&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nycpoetrybooks.eventbrite.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/nycpoetrybooks.eventbrite.com\/<\/a><\/a>, $10 per person @ the door.<\/p> <p>100% of any donations made through this event page goes evenly to the featured poets amd singer.<\/p> <p>ALL AGES welcome.<\/p> <p>*****<br\/>Pomegranate Gallery Press is located in New York City, founded by world renowned sculpture artist and poet Oded Halahmy.

All registrations must be done online via the Eventbrite link below before the event. No exceptions.<\/p> <p>*RSVPing through meetup does not guarantee admission. You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.\u00a0 Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people. What does that mean?<\/b><\/p> <p>That number represents the RSVPS (not registrations) that have come in through our other pages listed below. It is NOT the total number of people pre-paid. The typical number of people per event is 16-20.<\/p> <p><b>What should I wear?<\/b><\/p> <p>Business casual attire is perfect. No sneakers or athletic wear, please.<\/p> <p><b>What if I want to give someone my contact info at the event?<\/b><\/p> <p>Go for it! That's the whole point. Do whatever you are comfortable doing.<\/p> <p><b>Can I see photos of other attendees?<\/b><\/p> <p>Most people do not RSVP on meetup for privacy reasons. They only pre-pay and therefore do not share their photo.<\/p> <p><b>Where are all the RSVPs?<\/b><\/p> <p>About 50% of the registrations come through Eventbrite and our <a href=\"http:\/\/andthatswhyyouresingle.com\/\">main events website<\/a>. They are not Meetup members. Many people prefer not to post their Meetup profile or photo for privacy reasons. We often remove the event from the calendar once it has started so that people can't contact attendees without the attendee's expressed permission.<\/p> <p><b>What's The Refund Policy?<\/b><\/p> <p>Since we need to try and ensure a gender ratio as close to even as possible, our policy is that all registrations are final. We can not offer refunds or transfers to last minute cancellations. However, if you notify us at least 3 days in advance, we can give you a credit to another event.<\/p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend for moral support?<\/b><\/p> <p>You'd be surprised how many people arrive alone. We actually prefer that guests do not bring friends or \"spectators.\" It makes the other attendees uncomfortable. Fun fact: The people who sign up and arrive alone tend to get more matches than those who attend with friends.<\/p> <p><b>Will there be equal numbers of men or women?<\/b><\/p> <p>That's the goal.

Kiribatgoda Gnanananda Thero, and after two years of study and practice, attained High Ordination in 2009. After three more years of study, he had begun to develop a deep understanding of insight and tranquility techniques. In 2012 he was asked to begin and to organize a meditation center in Tampa, Florida to provide training to all those who wished to learn. The center was to be non-denominational; anyone of any religion could come and study the practices. Bhante Saddhasara also offered a Recovery Program for those suffering from addiction; an introductory mindfulness program for children; a prison program; and, throughout Florida and throughout the U.S.A, he also gave lectures and provided mindfulness and meditation teaching, as well as private counseling to adults and to youths of all ages.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713483\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713483","time":1456614000000,"updated":1456619382000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Ramsey","address_1":"Route 17 North by the Franklin Turnpike exit (old TGIF)","name":"Shannon Rose Irish Pub","lon":-74.140976,"id":5198982,"state":"NJ","lat":41.05732,"repinned":false},"headcount":30,"distance":22.6962547302,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454187457000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us at 6pm as we have a drink social with MEETUP members, then at 8pm, we will watch and hear a local band that was recommended to me by a MEETUP member called ''Love Revolution'' as they perform the sounds from the 60's through the new millennium.

Seriously, this movie's going to\u00a0make Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) the next household name when it comes to superheroes\u2014presuming that household doesn\u2019t mind a smidge of bad words or a smattering of\u00a0excessive violence by an masked lunatic mercenary.\u00a0In DEADPOOL, Wade Wilson undergoes an experiment that leaves him with a warped appearance, wicked sense of humor and personal vendetta against the scientist who disfigured him. It\u2019s going to take all three, along with the help of some X-Men, to exact his revenge... but it'll be a fun ride getting there.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Gods of Egypt - 2D \u00a0- 4:15 and 7:30\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p>The GODS OF EGYPT go head-to-head in this intense action film that pits Set (Gerard Butler), the God of Darkness, against the unlikely combination of Bek, a mortal, and the deity Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an epic battle for the throne to the land. Up against a powerful evil, our heroes must overcome their differences to stand up in the face of danger and survive the evil god\u2019s wrath in their efforts to save Bek\u2019s true love and the\u00a0world itself from a dark fate.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Hail Caesar! \u00a04pm and 7pm<\/b><\/p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/drafthouse.com\/nyc\/show\/hail-caesar\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p>The Coens have entertained audiences for years with their films, dense gifts to cinema that slyly wrap comedy in whichever genre they choose to inhabit at that time. HAIL, CAESAR! looks to bring the laughter back to the forefront, a film that tips its hat to the golden age of cinema while its clueless characters try to make sense of the caper they\u2019ve unwittingly become involved in. Actors line up to work with the Coen Brothers and HAIL, CAESAR! is no different, boasting an A-list cast of current Hollywood\u2019s heavy hitters. Their track record speaks for itself and this film hopes to reach the lofty expectations of any film attached to these auteurs. We can\u2019t wait to see the results.<\/p> <p><b>It happened One Night - 4pm<\/b><\/p> <p>The comedies of the '30s and '40s are filled with runaway heiresses and the rambunctious cads that fall in love with them, but few manage to capture the sparkling chemistry achieved in this seminal\u00a0Oscar-winning Claudette Colbert\/Clark Gable production.<\/p> <p>Colbert plays a spoiled, rich girl desperate to escape her father's overbearing clutches and return to the arms of the man she loves, aviator King Westley. On the run from Miami to New York, she meets up with Peter Warne (Gable), a down-on-his-luck reporter who's stumbled upon the story of the century.<\/p> <p>Though his initial intentions are strictly geared toward his journalistic salvation, romance soon rears its head and the whole affair soon blooms into a semi-sweet adventure of legendary proportions.<\/p> <p><b>The Witch - 6:30 and 9pm<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>An impressive and award-winning debut by writer\/director Robert Eggers that has garnered him well-deserved praise for his vision AND one of the breakout films of Fantastic Fest 2015, THE WITCH is a return to form for the horror genre, serving up blood-curdling fright by building a dread-inducing ambiance that will leave fans of classic horror movies screaming\u2014for more. Rather than easy scares, THE WITCH takes its time to paint a portrait of a colonial-era family being torn apart by evil forces and the disappearance of their son and the build up pays off: long after you\u2019re done squirming in your theater seat, THE WITCH will have you looking over your shoulder.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Where to Invade Next - 7:45 and 9:45<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/>Where to Invade Next is an expansive, rib-tickling, and subversive comedy in which Moore, playing the role of \u201cinvader,\u201d visits a host of nations to learn how the U.S. could improve its own prospects. The creator of Fahrenheit 9\/11 and Bowling for Columbine is back with this hilarious and eye-opening call to arms. Turns out the solutions to America\u2019s most entrenched problems already exist in the world\u2014they\u2019re just waiting to be co-opted.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Zoolander 2 - 5pm, \u00a07pm, and 10pm<\/b><\/p> <p>ZOOLANDER 2 reunites Derek and Hansel (Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson) and, lucky for us, they\u2019ve brought all the laughter of 2001\u2019s original film back with them.

St. Petersburg<br\/>Musical direction by Valery Gergiev<\/p> <p>Featuring Diana Vishneva and members of the Mariinsky Ballet Diana Vishneva dances Carolyn Carlson\u2019s intimate solo Woman in a Room, and then performs Alberto Alonso\u2019s Carmen Suite with members of the Mariinsky Ballet.<\/p> <p>For decades, the legendary Maya Plisetskaya (1925\u20132015)\u2014muse to choreographers Yuri Grigorovich, Alberto Alonso, and Maurice B\u00e9jart\u2014was synonymous with Russian ballet. A star in the truest sense of the word, she is remembered for the ravenous intensity of her hyperphysical dancing and the spitfire personality that captivated audiences around the world, onstage and off. Following her passing in May 2015, the Mariinsky presents an extended tribute to this iconic performer, comprising four distinct mixed programs featuring the incomparable Diana Vishneva and longstanding principal Uliana Lopatkina, performing with live accompaniment by the Mariinsky Orchestra.<br\/>Program C opens with Vishneva performing Carolyn Carlson\u2019s Woman in a Room, an intimate solo commissioned specifically for her and inspired by the films of Andrei Tarkovsky. In the second half of the program, she is joined by members of the Mariinsky Ballet for Alberto Alonso\u2019s Carmen Suite, a sensuous, electrifying work originally choreographed for Plisetskaya.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Brodyaga\/events\/228245609\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"The Mariinsky at BAM \/A Tribute to Maya Plisetskaya:","id":"228245609","time":1456618500000,"updated":1457356307000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1372387976000,"name":"Brodyaga \/ Russian adventure group","group_lon":-73.9800033569,"id":9125272,"urlname":"Brodyaga","group_lat":40.6399993896,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10012","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"107 MacDougal St","lon":-74.000957,"phone":"212.529.3808","name":"The Grisly Pear ","id":709407,"state":"NY","lat":40.72992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.50437867641,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455496739000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hi All,\u00a0<\/p> <p>I'm getting folks together for a comedy show and hang at the Grisly Pear in the West Village and we're giving everyone free pizza!

Japas 38 is a karaoke lounge in the city that's made with the shy singer in mind. It's Korean-style karaoke, so we will have a large private room for our group with couches, much like a large living room. There's no need to be embarrassed because you'll be safe with friends :) And if you're still embarrassed, you'll have a steady supply of all you can drink alcohol to help you out! The cost of this event is $35\/person. That includes two hours in the room, all you can drink white wine, red wine and sake (maybe beer, but don't quote me on that), a group sushi platter and a group appetizer platter (From previous experience, they offer enough to nosh on but maybe not enough to fill a grown man's belly, so pre-gaming a sandwich for dinner might not be a horrible idea.) For anyone who wants to stay past the two hour mark, the cost is $15\/person for one extra hour and $25\/person for two extra hours. The base cost of $35 will cover you from 8p-10p! (If you show up late, your two hours still start at 8p, just a head's up!) If you stay after (even as a spectator) be prepared to pay up. Any one who's done the K-town karaoke knows that this is a great deal and ALWAYS an amazing time. We have lots of awful singers among us, so come serenade us with pride!

They also have THE BEST hot apple cider you will ever taste.<\/p> <p>This is a great chance to make new friends and to hang out with some old friends. A bunch of my friends (all different ages) come to this show as well as locals and comedy lovers. We also have an Instagram photo contest. Whoever takes the coolest photos of the event and posts them on Instagram with #hashtagcomedy will win TWO free tickets to an upcoming show! We will chose 2 winners the Monday after the show!<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there!!<\/p> <p>Hashtag Comedy invites some of the best comics to comment on today's hottest issues. We choose the funniest up and coming stand ups to dissect the trending topics of today's world. The show is a great opportunity to laugh and learn.

Money\" and see where all the money is going. \u00a0If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought. \u00a0Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. \u00a0WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE. \u00a0IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/events\/229003869\/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am!","id":"hssxjlyvdblc","time":1456668000000,"updated":1456680362000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1284434687000,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":1706490,"urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11104","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Queens","address_1":"46-09 Queens Boulevard","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.918266,"id":1550476,"state":"NY","lat":40.74329,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.79100322723,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454897312000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's head out for a\u00a0<i>MidPackers Long, Slow Distance<\/i> (MPLSD)\u00a0<i>Run<\/i>.

The ski area receives an average of 450 inches of snowfall each year and boasts a vertical of more than 4,000 feet. The resort may be known for having extreme terrain, but there are plenty of options for beginners and intermediates.

Rendezvous Mountain is home to some of the most extreme terrain in North America. It has a continuous vertical rise of 4,139 feet with endless steeps, powder filled open bowls, chutes, gullies, cliffs, ridges and trees \u2013 an expert snow rider's dream! The best powder runs at Jackson Hole are from the summit down Rendezvous Bowl to the bottom of the Hoback chutes.<\/p> <p>Apres Vous Mountain is the tamer of the two mountains, home to the majority of Jackson Hole's groomed intermediate trails, Casper and Saratoga Bowls. The trails under the Apres Vous Chairlift are wide, not too steep and are often groomed. In windy conditions the Saratoga Bowl remains sheltered and is suitable for competent intermediates. This is the place to tackle some fun powder tree skiing and snowboarding. The lower slopes on Apres Vous Mountain house gentle sheltered beginner trails excellent for learning. The Mountain Sports School at Jackson Hole have professional instructors for all ages and ability levels. The 2006\/2007 winter season saw the introduction of the Sweetwater Chairlift which links gentle beginner terrain to intermediate terrain at mid-mountain level creating a gradual transition from green slopes to blues.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.powdertravel.com\/ski_jackson_hole.htm\">(via PowderTravel.com)<\/a><\/p> <p>Lodging<\/p> <p>Located in downtown Jackson, Wyoming and set amid Jackson\u2019s wonderful restaurants, shops, art galleries, and nightspots, the newly-renovated 49er Inn features 30 beautiful fireplace suites, and has a great location and many amenities.<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.mmssc.org\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/49er_renovated-150x150.jpg\" \/> With 140 rooms and suites, extended continental breakfast, 35 person indoor hot tub, 12 person outdoor hot tub, fitness room, sauna, and 2 conference rooms, the 49'er Inn and Suites easily accommodate your lodging needs.<\/p> <p>The Inn is three blocks west of Jackson's Town Square - within \u201ccrawling\u201d distance of the World Famous\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.milliondollarcowboybar.com\/\">Million Dollar Cowboy Bar<\/a>!<\/p> <p>New guests and returning visitors will appreciate all of the Inn's brand new updates and renovations to one of Jackson Hole Wyoming's favorite properties.

It is possible to know and live from your True Self with a deep sense of well-being, creativity and unconditional love.<\/p> <p>Loch will draw from the ancient wisdom of Sutra Mahamudra and other nondual traditions, as well as current neuroscientific research to point us beyond our ego-centered identity in order to live from an open-hearted awareness.<\/p> <p>We will learn how to know your true nature and live from open-hearted awareness through contemporary versions of ancient wisdom practices such as effortless mindfulness, nondual awareness, embodied presence and small glimpses many times.

The Sunday School Graduation Rite of Passage, completed by our 8th graders, allows them to present to the community how their Sunday School experience has informed their moral and ethical development.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/EthicalFocus\/events\/229044557\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Sunday School at the Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County","id":"qcmtklyvdblc","time":1456675200000,"updated":1456687484000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1202088040000,"name":"The Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":991158,"urlname":"EthicalFocus","group_lat":40.8899993896,"who":"humanists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"distance":9.08166980743,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446386739000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Philip Roth rarely fails to entertain, and his darkly comic <i>Sabbath's Theater<\/i> should live up to our expectations. It is also the first longer read of the year, weighing in at over 400 pages.\u00a0<\/p> <p>The central character of the novel, Mickey Sabbath, is a 64-year-old forced into retirement because of arthritis. The theater of the novel's title refers to Mickey's puppet act from the 1960s that was performed by his middle finger while his other fingers deftly set about disrobing female members of the audience.<\/p> <p>Lechery, it seems, is Mickey's vocation in life and Roth is blithely indifferent to political correctness. Most of the novel is a gleeful recounting of Mickey's many infidelities. Even his grief at the death of his latest mistress is a motivated more by anxieties about this failing powers of seduction than by any romantic longing. Mickey plunders the underwear drawer of his best friend's daughter in search of an aid to masturbation, he sneers at his wife's attempts to combat alcoholism, and he urinates on the grave of a former mistress.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Like Alexander Portnoy, the famously self-abusing character in Roth's 1969 novel <i>Portnoy's Complaint<\/i>, Sabbath has an appetite for acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, and auto-eroticism. But while Portnoy's antics were usually comical and liberating, Sabbath often feels imprisoned by his own acts of self-indulgence. Though his frantic pursuit of sex is a desperate attempt to abate his anxieties about death, it only serves to obliterate any semblance of real life he could have had.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck\/events\/226458322\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Philip Roth's Sabbath's Theater--Winner of the National Book Award","id":"226458322","time":1456675200000,"updated":1456701396000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1368808221000,"name":"NYC Prize-Winning Book Club & Vegan Potluck","group_lon":-73.9199981689,"id":8526662,"urlname":"The-NYC-Prize-Winning-Book-Club-Vegan-Food-Potluck","group_lat":40.8699989319,"who":"Awesomesaucers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"1290 Sixth Ave enter on 52nd St betw 5th & 6th","name":"Starbucks","lon":-73.833504,"id":20656452,"state":"NY","lat":40.782001,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":6,"headcount":5,"distance":8.4998216629,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456026632000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>NOTE:\u00a0 DATE IS SUN FEB 28, NOT SUN MARCH 6 PER ORIGINAL LISTING<\/p> <p><br\/>\"Jackson Pollock:\u00a0 A Collection Survey\" is a sweeping exhibit of about 50 pieces, using assorted techniques and materials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Let's start by meeting at Starbucks, to\u00a0introduce ourselves over coffee.<\/p> <p>Then we'll go over to MOMA, to see the show.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Here's a link to the exhibition page:<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1553\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1553\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.moma.org\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1553<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>I'm hoping we can more or less synchronize our viewing pace, so that we can see--and share--and comment on--this exhibit.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Attendees are responsible for paying for any purchases from Starbucks, and for the special $5 guest rate to enter MOMA on my membership pass.\u00a0 That's right, you will save $20 vs. the normal $25 admission price!\u00a0<\/p> <p>If something comes up and you can't attend, please change your RSVP status as soon as possible.\u00a0 Given the small size of this meetup group, no-show's would be a big loss.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Meet inside Starbucks at 1290 Sixth Ave, entrance on 52nd St, between 5th & 6th Ave.  I will display a red Meetup sign.","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Experience-Share-Group\/events\/229009757\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Connect by Seeing the Jackson Pollock Exhibit at MOMA","id":"229009757","time":1456675200000,"updated":1456758069000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1391144665000,"name":"NYC Experience Share Group for 40-Somethings & 50-Somethings","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":12625032,"urlname":"NYC-Experience-Share-Group","group_lat":40.75,"who":"NYConnectors"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"07666","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Teaneck","address_1":"687 Larch Ave","lon":-74.026237,"phone":"201-836-5187","name":"Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County","id":340694,"state":"NJ","lat":40.888088,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.74703216553,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455997615000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/6\/6\/b\/600_447034411.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>What if corporations are people, and the Citizens\u2019 United ruling a good thing?

(Professional in-house lights, props,\u00a0various\u00a0seamless backdrops, actual commercial photography sets, kitchen, waiting room, meeting\/presentation room, the works!)\u00a0It's\u00a0conveniently located to major highways and a 20-30 minute public transportation ride to and from NY.<\/p> <p><b>Check-in Procedure and Disclaimers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Check-in<\/b>\u00a0- When you arrive, there will be a quick check-in. This will mostly be so you can read and adhere to the studio\/group shoot guidelines and make payment for the shoot before we start. This will also let us send you the release forms in PDF format if we don't have physical copies available.<\/p> <p><b>Releases<\/b>\u00a0- We will have one non-commercial release signed by the model through the studio only. (No additional releases will be signed.) If you need a commercial release signed, you can make arrangements with the model directly. Additional compensation for this is between the model and photographer.<\/p> <p>Right to Refuse\u00a0- We have the right to refuse a member's RSVP to the Meetup. It's a small community and models keep detailed info on photographers also. If we feel there is justifiable reason to refuse a RSVP, we will exercise that right.<\/p> <p><b>Signups<\/b>\u00a0- Please signup when you know you will attend. If the signup passes the point to book another model and then we get no shows it's not fair to your fellow photographers who would be on a waiting list. It also puts the organizers in a tough spot, financially after booking an additional model to compensate for a bigger group. In case of no show, we will have to remove you from the group. When emergencies come up, followup with an email and we can make exceptions on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Deposit<\/b>\u00a0- We have implemented a deposit system to insure that the minimum RSVP is met to hold the shoot. (Which varies from shoot to shoot.) This will ensure that the financials are or will be in place for the model\/s beforehand. This deposit will be non-refundable, so make sure you sign up and pay the deposit when you are sure you will be able to attend. Signing up to the Meetup page does not ensure your spot until the deposit is made at the Paypal link provided on each event page. As the shoot date comes closer, if you have not paid the deposit, we will fill the unconfirmed spot immediately. You will receive a confirmation message or a confirmation comment on the Meetup page you are signing up for. Two days before the shoot, if the minimum RSVP has not been met then we will opt to cancel the shoot and refund any deposits already sent. This will give the model some time to book another gig if possible. But as usual, always check the Meetup page up to the date of the shoot for any updates.<\/p> <p><b>Model Cancellation<\/b>\u00a0- If a model cancels\/no show or a last minute model change occurs, you will have the option to cancel beforehand or not attend the Meetup on the day of, if it happens upon arrival to the Meetup. (Any refunds will be given or credit toward a future Meetup as per your request.)<\/p> <p><b>Waitlist<\/b>\u00a0- When you are on a waitlist, please be mindful as this is also considered a RSVP of availability. So, if we add another model or someone cancels, your wait list status may upgrade to a \"Yes\" automatically. Please be on the lookout for updates on the Meetup page as Meetup sometimes takes longer to notify of a status change.<\/p> <p><b>Updates<\/b>\u00a0- Updates will be made on this page up to the date of the Meetup or the night before. Emails will also be sent but Meetup emails are not always reliable to be sent to a receiver right away. (I've heard of emails arriving 3 hours later if at all.)<\/p> <p><b>Postponements<\/b>\u00a0- Weather considerations will be made the night before a shoot or on the day of and the Meetup page will be updated as well as emails sent if a postponement occurs due to inclement weather or some other emergency.

You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>MORNINGSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Morningside location is at the corner of 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue. The best way to get there is to take the C local (B on weekdays) to 110th Street. You can also take the 1 train to 110th street at Broadway and then walk East. We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball\/softball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p>","why":"It's fun and you like it...","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCUltimate\/events\/229046842\/","yes_rsvp_count":12,"name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 12PM, Riverside Park","id":"gjrzflyvdblc","time":1456678800000,"updated":1456690895000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1164744359000,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":374316,"urlname":"NYCUltimate","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"3009 Broadway (at 118th Street)","name":"Barnard College, Barnard Hall, 4th Floor, James Room","lon":-73.963348,"id":24279620,"state":"NY","lat":40.809551,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.35315990448,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1451804050000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com\/\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/10\/cropped-header_2016_fzf.jpg\" \/> <\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com\/2015\/12\/19\/excitement-brews-for-fzf-2016\/\">Excitement brews for FZF\u00a02016!<\/a><\/p> <p>We were thrilled to have almost 100 applications for this year\u2019s zinefest!<\/p> <p>We\u2019re super looking forward to February 28th \u2013 a cozy winter day, when the air is filled with the excitement of fresh zines and new folks.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/img_6487.jpg?w=500\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/img_6487.jpg?w=500<\/a><\/p> <p>Also, photos from last year are\u00a0now up!\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com\/photos\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com\/photos\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com\/photos\/<\/a><\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/RadFemActivists\/events\/227796981\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":21600000,"name":"NYC FEMINIST ZINEFEST, Barnard College, 2\/28","id":"227796981","time":1456678800000,"updated":1456701328000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1450383349000,"name":"Radical Feminist Activists","group_lon":-74.0100021362,"id":19220431,"urlname":"RadFemActivists","group_lat":40.7299995422,"who":"RadFem Activists"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"10026","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"46 West 116th Street","name":"Mist Harlem","lon":-73.94854,"id":11397342,"state":"NY","lat":40.801228,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.15973949432,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453184862000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We invite you to join us at the premier of AFROJAM BRUNCH.<br\/>Featuring Anthony Morgan &amp; The Harlem Spirit of Gospel<br\/>on Sunday February 28 2016.

We believe that the best way to learn is through practical experience, and therefore our unique interactive workshop model will focus on active participation, hands-on problem solving, and cooperative teamwork. Through this workshop, you will learn all you need to realize your consultant dream.<\/p> <p>The workshop will include two areas:<br\/>(1) Case study framework<br\/>(2) Case interview (The workshop will focus more on case interview)<\/p> <p>COURSE CONTENT\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/4\/d\/600_447003917.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>The case interview is a mystery to many. We\u2019ve all heard about it, but yet do not really quite understand what it is, much less how to answer one. Lucky for you, we are here to demystify the case interview and give you the skill sets to ace a case interview. The idea of a case interview is to test your problem solving skills. It emphasizes both structure and creativity. A case interview will be divided into multiple sections that test different sets of skills, namely your ability to understand data, conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis, and effectively synthesis. We will be working through all of those areas.<\/p> <p>Some of you might be under the impression that there are an infinite number of possible cases, and therefore do not know where to start or have resorted to Case in Point for their frameworks. Neither of those are good ideas. If you want to get into management consulting and you are using Case in Point, you\u2019ve already failed. While there theoretically can be infinite types of cases, the majority fall under two categories, the business case interview and the profitability interview. The cases that we will be going over are real cases that were used in first and final rounds at McKinsey, Bain, and BCG to give you a real feel of what to expect on interview day. We will work through the cases from beginning to end, from initial problem structuring to synthesizing a recommendation to the CEO. For this portion of the workshop, you will be organized into teams of 4-5 to work on the case together. This is a very important test of your team-working abilities. After working through the cases, you will have both the confidence and the skill set to dominate the case interview.<\/p> <p>AGENDA<br\/>13:00-14:00 How to Crack a Case<br\/>14:00-16:00 One-on-One Case Interview<\/p> <p>WHEN<br\/>Sunday, February 28, 2016 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM (EST)<\/p> <p>WHERE<br\/>1270 Broadway, Suite 505 New York, NY 10001<\/p> <p>RSVP:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/consulting-case-interview-training-class-tickets-21535950608\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/consulting-case-interview-training-class-tickets-21535950608\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/consulting-case-interview-training-class-tickets-21535950608<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/f\/6\/5\/600_447003941.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Let\u2019s work together to get you one giant leap closer to your goal, to your dream!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYC-Career-Advice-Networking-Events-for-Young-Jobseekers\/events\/228957866\/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":10800000,"name":"Consulting Case Interview Training Class","id":"228957866","time":1456682400000,"updated":1456694958000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1455643495000,"name":"NYC Career Advice & Networking Events for Young Jobseekers","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":19579590,"urlname":"NYC-Career-Advice-Networking-Events-for-Young-Jobseekers","group_lat":40.75,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"distance":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1437805745000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/8\/3\/c\/600_359279452.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b>Note: Only RSVP if you are planning to show up.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>First Timers, READ details before you RSVP.\u00a0<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Where:<\/b>\u00a0The Cliffs at LIC,\u00a0[masked]th Drive,\u00a0Long Island City,\u00a0NY<\/p> <p><b>When:<\/b> We usually climb between 1:00pm and 4:00 pm.

You can enter on 88th street and take the elevator to the mezzanine level once in the store. The escalators don't even go to this in between mezzanine level, only to levels 1 and 2. There is also a small opening to pass near the check out lines but that can be hard to find.<\/p> <p>Please avoid wearing fragrances as several people in our group are sensitive to them including myself.<\/p> <p>I will post my cell phone number in the comments the day before the event so you can contact me if you have trouble finding us or want to know if we are still there. :)<\/p> <p>Please note this is different than a common past location on the east side.\u00a0 It is NOT the East 57th street one, it's at 88th Street and 3rd Avenue.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"If taking subway, the closest one is 86th and Lexington and the 4,5 and 6 stop there.

Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, a parent may choose to retroactively get rid of a child through a process called \"unwinding.\" Unwinding ensures that the child's life doesn\u2019t \u201ctechnically\u201d end by transplanting all the organs in the child's body to various recipients. Now a common and accepted practice in society, troublesome or unwanted teens are able to easily be unwound.<\/p> <p>With breathtaking suspense, this book follows three teens who all become runaway Unwinds: Connor, a rebel whose parents have ordered his unwinding; Risa, a ward of the state who is to be unwound due to cost-cutting; and Lev, his parents\u2019 tenth child whose unwinding has been planned since birth as a religious tithing. As their paths intersect and lives hang in the balance, Shusterman examines complex moral issues that will keep readers turning the pages until the very end.\"<\/p> <p>Sorry about this being the first in a series again!<\/p> <p><br\/>LOCATION<br\/>We will be meeting at the Citigroup Atrium.<\/p> <p>\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/3\/1\/600_42060561.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>There is an entrance at 53rd and Lexington Avenue off of the 53rd and Lex subway stop.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713502\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713502","time":1456686000000,"updated":1456691121000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"Lower East Side","name":"Private Residence","lon":-73.984276,"id":24352941,"state":"NY","lat":40.715034,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":5,"distance":2.43947863579,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454863142000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Eric Asimov, wine critic for The New York Times, has been running a monthly wine \"school\" column for the newspaper's readers. He selects a region, does a little write-up, and identifies three wines to try. After drinking the wines, people go to the newspaper's on-line comments section to have a conversation about what they've learned and liked. I've had fun doing this for several months, but thought it might be even better with some of you. Let's meet together from time to time, to drink and talk!<\/p> <p>The point of this group is to teach and learn from each other. \u00a0All levels are welcome, though we do want participation in tasting and discussing the wines from all. \u00a0We keep the group small so we can focus on the wines! \u00a0Good behavior is a must, as we will be meeting in a private residence.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>What to bring<\/b>: Each participant will be expected to read Asimov's monthly wine write-up and bring one bottle of wine recommended in the article. He generally identifies three specific bottles, and also lists alternates if the three are not available. I find snooth.com and wine-searcher.com helpful in figuring out which wine shops might have the bottle you are looking for. \u00a0But they're not foolproof: calling the shop to confirm is recommended. \u00a0I generally have had good luck at Astor Wines, Flatiron Wines, 67 Wines, Union Square Wines and Sherry-Lehmann Wines. Please make every effort to find the specific bottles listed by Asimov. Be sure to post a comment with which wine you will be bringing so that we can have a variety of bottles. Some bottle duplication is fine when our group is large, but we don't want all the same bottle.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Because wine needs food, each participant should also bring something tasty to eat and share.\u00a0<\/p> <p><b>RSVP and Waitlist:<\/b>\u00a0 If the Meetup is full, you will be offered the option of placing your name on a Waitlist. \u00a0<b>Be aware that the Meetup platform will automatically change your RSVP from \"Waitlist\" and \"Yes\" if a spot opens.<\/b> The expectation is that you will monitor your status on the Waitlist, and remove your name if you no longer want to attend. \u00a0<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b>\u00a0 The cost of the Asimov Wine School meetups will vary depending on the cost of that month's wine. \u00a0Generally it's been somewhere between $15-$70 for the bottle you bring plus the cost of whatever snack you select to share.<\/p> <p><b>February's details<\/b>: \u00a0We'll be drinking from Etna Rosso region of Sicily\u00a0this month.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/03\/dining\/wine-school-assignment-etna-rosso.html\">Click here to read Asimov's Etna Rosso writeup and see which wines we will be drinking!<\/a><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The address will be sent to attendees near date of event","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NYCwinetastingschool\/events\/228680896\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":18000000,"name":"Etna Rosso Wine","id":"228680896","time":1456686000000,"updated":1456937036000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1190320947000,"name":"Wine Tasting \"School\" of New York and more!","group_lon":-73.9499969482,"id":697965,"urlname":"NYCwinetastingschool","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Wine Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"zip":"11217","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Brooklyn","address_1":"620 Atlantic Avenue","name":"Barclays Center","lon":-73.976028,"id":12040182,"state":"NY","lat":40.683487,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.66314029694,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452444914000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/8\/8\/a\/600_445787242.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><br\/>*Shooting animals to death when the intense, unnatural confinement causes them to engage in aggressive or self destructive, stereotypical behaviors<\/p> <p>*Continuously\/routinely inflicting painful punishments on animals who do not perform under a diabolical mixture of stress, fear and deprivation of all that is natural, as \"necessary\" to keep the animals obedient, the crowds entertained and the million$$$ rolling in.<\/p> <p>*Cynically scoffing in the face of USDA *minimal* requirements of animal welfare, including adequate veterinary care, reasonable opportunities to engage in natural behavior, sufficient space, exercise and drinking water.<\/p> <p>The atrocities go on and on and on.<\/p> <p>What you should know about Ringling Bros:<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.mediapeta.com\/peta\/PDF\/RinglingFactsheet.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>STEP RIGHT UP, Ladies and Gentlemen, to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ringlingbeatsanimals.com\/\">Cruelest Show on Earth!

From the extra pounds and unrelenting bullies that left Jasmin Singer eating lunch alone in a bathroom stall at school, to the low self-esteem that left her both physically and emotionally vulnerable, Jasmin spent her younger years feeling completely lost.<\/p> <p>Most people think there\u2019s no such thing as a fat vegan. Most people don\u2019t realize that deep-fried tofu tastes amazing and that Oreos are, in fact, vegan. So, even after Jasmin discovered her passion in advocating for the rights of animals, she defied any \u201cskinny vegan\u201d stereotypes by getting even heavier. More importantly, she realized that her compassion for others didn\u2019t extend to her own body, and that her low self-esteem was affecting her health. She needed a change.<\/p> <p>Told with humble humor and heartbreaking honesty, ALWAYS TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH: A Memoir is Jasmin\u2019s story of how she went from a bullied kid who found solace in a box of cheese crackers to becoming an empowered activist and finding peace with herself, her body, and her sexuality.<\/p> <p>By committing to monthly juice fasts and a diet of whole, unprocessed foods, Jasmin lost almost a hundred pounds, gained an understanding of her destructive relationship with food, and even learned some hard truths about how intensely our society values thinness.<\/p> <p>In a relatable memoir about finding one\u2019s true identity and what that really means, Jasmin Singer\u2019s debut is a raw and powerful account of self-realization. Above all ALWAYS TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH is an inspiration to create one\u2019s best self.<\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/5\/6\/b\/4\/600_445702196.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><b> About Jasmin:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jasmin Singer is the executive director of Our Hen House, a non-profit organization aiming to change the world for animals.

This question has fueled a long-running debate. Some have argued that humans are fundamentally competitive, and that pursuing self-interest is the best way to get ahead. Others claim that humans are born to cooperate and that we are most successful when we collaborate with others.<\/p> <p>In FRIEND\u00a0<i>AND<\/i>\u00a0FOE, researchers Galinsky and Schweitzer explain why this debate misses the mark. Rather than being hardwired to compete or cooperate, we have evolved to do both. In every relationship, from co-workers to friends to spouses to siblings we are both friends\u00a0<i>and<\/i>\u00a0foes. It is only by learning how to strike the right balance between these two forces that we can improve our long-term relationships\u00a0<i>and<\/i>\u00a0get more of what we want.<\/p> <p>Here, Galinsky and Schweitzer draw on original, cutting edge research from their own labs and from across the social sciences as well as vivid real-world examples to show how to maximize success in work and in life by deftly navigating the tension between cooperation and competition. They offer insights and advice ranging from: how to gain power and keep it, how to build trust and repair trust once it\u2019s broken, how to diffuse workplace conflict and bias, how to find the right comparisons to motivate us and make us happier, and how to succeed in negotiations \u2013 ensuring that we achieve our own goals and satisfy those of our counterparts.<\/p> <p>Along the way, they pose and offer surprising answers to a number of perplexing puzzles: when does\u00a0<i>too much<\/i>\u00a0talent undermine success; why can acting\u00a0<i>less<\/i>competently gain you status and authority, where do many gender differences in the workplace\u00a0<i>really\u00a0<\/i>come from, how can you use deception to\u00a0<i>build<\/i>\u00a0trust, and why do you want to go last on\u00a0<i>American Idol<\/i>\u00a0and in many interview situations, but make the first offer when negotiating the sale of a new car.<\/p> <p>We perform at our very best when we hold cooperation and competition in the right balance. This book is a guide for navigating our social and professional worlds by learning when to cooperate as a friend and when to compete as a foe\u2014and how to be better at both.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for the ANSI Suite","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Behavioral-Economics-Meetup-NYC\/events\/228592203\/","yes_rsvp_count":41,"name":"Feb MeetUp: Friend & Foe","id":"228592203","time":1456691400000,"updated":1456882768000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1399873683000,"name":"Behavioral Economics Reading & Discussion Group @ NYC","group_lon":-73.9700012207,"id":14398962,"urlname":"Behavioral-Economics-Meetup-NYC","group_lat":40.7999992371,"who":"Behavioral Researchers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"rsvp_limit":9,"headcount":0,"distance":5.53888320923,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455542496000,"fee":{"amount":273.820007324,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/b\/2\/a\/600_20611530.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Hello everyone!

If you\u2019re like most people, chances are you react with fear and confusion, falling back on timeworn strategies: anger, self-judgment, and addictive behaviors. Though these old, conditioned attempts to control our life may offer fleeting relief, ultimately they leave us feeling isolated and mired in pain.<\/p> <p>There is another way. Beneath the turbulence of our thoughts and emotions exists a profound stillness, a silent awareness capable of limitless love. Tara Brach, author of the award-winning <b>Radical Acceptance<\/b>, calls this awareness our true refuge, because it is available to every one of us, at any moment, no exceptions. In this book, Brach offers a practical guide to finding our inner sanctuary of peace and wisdom in the midst of difficulty.<\/p> <p>Based on a fresh interpretation of the three classic Buddhist gateways to freedom\u2014truth, love, and awareness\u2014<b>True Refuge<\/b> shows us the way not just to heal our suffering, but also to cultivate our capacity for genuine happiness. Through spiritual teachings, guided meditations, and inspirational stories of people who discovered loving presence during times of great struggle, Brach invites us to connect more deeply with our own inner life, one another, and the world around us.<\/p> <p><b>True Refuge<\/b> is essential reading for anyone encountering hardship or crisis, anyone dedicated to a path of spiritual awakening. The book reminds us of our own innate intelligence and goodness, making possible an enduring trust in ourselves and our lives. We realize that what we seek is within us, and regardless of circumstances, \u201cthere is always a way to take refuge in a healing and liberating presence.\u201d<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAll prices listed are publisher's prices.<b>\u00a0The Astoria Bookshop will be offering a 10% discount<\/b> for anyone in our group who purchases the eventual selection through them. Please email Emily to let her know if you would like to have a copy ordered for you. It will take the bookshop about a week to get the books in. Our book discussion will be Sunday, January 10th at 5pm.

He is also the founder of Gaiaville\u00ae, the first sustainable intentional community of its kind. Pierre started his journey toward ascension at the age of 11, and strives to explain with science the \u2018magic\u2019 of the spiritual and supernatural. He was initiated in Mystery Schools, studied all world religions, belief systems and spiritual movements. Throughout his extensive studies and travels, he discovers that no matter how we express it, we all have the same desires: find love, fulfill our purpose, leave a positive footprint behind and ultimately experience merger back to God.<\/p> <p>A gifted healer, spiritual teacher and counselor, Pierre is also a certified life coach and hypnotist, regression therapist, channel, and Minister. He pioneered the groundbreaking Celestial Light Healing\u00ae method and specialized in healing the healers and energy workers. Believing that \u201cthe path toward illumination is a solo act, but not a lonely road\u201d, Pierre has helped countless people on their journey of healing, expansion and ascension, by teaching classes weekly, from the very heart of his home in New York City, and offering workshops and lectures throughout the country.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iammonad.com\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iammonad.com\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.iammonad.com\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/><i>Blessings<\/i><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Esoteric-Vision-Healing-NYC\/events\/229055715\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Ascension Classes for Beginners - In person or conference call","id":"vpnzflyvdblc","time":1456700400000,"updated":1456712876000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1379803756000,"name":"Esoteric Vision & Healing NYC","group_lon":-74,"id":10367332,"urlname":"Esoteric-Vision-Healing-NYC","group_lat":40.7400016785,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"150 W 46","name":"The Sacred Light Fellowship","lon":-73.984283,"id":17614742,"state":"NY","lat":40.757992,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":0.629292488098,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1385764747000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>\"Psychic &amp; Spiritual Development\"<\/b><br\/>The class meets every Sunday of each month from 6 to 7:30pm.<\/p> <p>This class will be an in-depth study of psychic reading, healing and developing further your clairvoyant abilities.

In 1929, John Ringling ordered the execution of a majestic bull elephant named Black Diamond after the elephant killed a woman who had been in the crowd as he was paraded through a Texas city. Twenty men took aim and pumped some 170 bullets into Black Diamond's body and then chopped off his bullet-ridden head and mounted it for display in Houston. Ringling Bros.' cruel treatment of animals continues today.<\/p> <p>Elephants in Ringling's possession are chained inside filthy, poorly ventilated boxcars for an average of more than 26 hours straight\u2014and up to 100 hours at a time\u2014when the circus travels. Even former Ringling employees have reported that elephants are routinely abused and violently beaten with bullhooks (weapons that resemble a fireplace poker) in order to force them to perform tricks.<\/p> <p>To learn more about Ringling's lengthy history of abusing animals, check out PETA's factsheet. <a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\"><a href=\"http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/circuses.com\/pdfs\/RinglingHiddenTruthFSetc.pdf<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>There will also be protests every day Ringling's will be at the Barclay Center.<\/b><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/227713507\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":3600000,"name":"The Animals\u2019 Battalion: Ringling Brothers Circus Protest @ Barclays Center","id":"227713507","time":1456700400000,"updated":1456705090000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1080381341000,"name":"NYC Animal Rights","group_lon":-73.9899978638,"id":8458,"urlname":"Animals","group_lat":40.7599983215,"who":"Animal Lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"New York","address_1":"48 Wall Street, 5th Floor","name":"Hope Hill","lon":-74.009041,"id":24232115,"state":"NY","lat":40.706566,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":3.16892170906,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452622050000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>IMPORTANT MESSAGE:<br\/>Event postponed to Sunday 2\/28\/16, 6pm due to emergency travel and weather restrictions this weekend (1\/24) AND Super Bowl Sunday events (2\/7).

I believe that we can all expect some great things from God this year and I would like this group to be a committed group of enterprising believers! A brief introduction, I'm Grace and one of the new Co-organizers of this meetup along with Nicole M. After the Organizer stepped down, Nicole took up the baton and asked me if I'd like to join her as Co-Organizer, to which I thoughtfully agreed. We look forward to meeting you all soon!<\/p> <p>I think it would be great to meet in January to start to build the personal connections that God-willing with grow within the year. We are currently planning some events but would love to hear about the needs, interests and preferences of the group!<\/p> <p>On Sunday, 1\/24\/16 at 6pm, I'm hosting a communal dinner party at Hope Hill and you are all invited to attend. As a seated communal dinner we really have a chance to connect. I'd ask that you come with your business cards and be prepared to share one of your favorite books or scriptures that helps or has helped you in your faith-filled Entrepreneurial journey. This will be one of our few meet &amp; greet events to start off the year.<\/p> <p>If any of you are doing the Daniel Fast then you may find this event more interesting as it is a meal inspired by the Daniel Fast and is Vegan in nature.

It is set just before World War I and chronicles the tragedy of Edward Ashburnham, the soldier to whom the title refers, and his own seemingly perfect marriage and that of two American friends. The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique that formed part of Ford's pioneering view of literary impressionism. Ford employs the device of the unreliable narrator[1] to great effect as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads the reader to believe.

Were gonna continue doing this as long as the club lets us. I met some of the most fun and amazing people, the comics were a full top Comedy Central line up too. For those of you who havent been to this, This is a special Meetup, we finally got a deal with Stand Up New York the hottest club in New York City to let us in free of charge and see comics like Amy Shumer, Godfrey, Kevin Brennan and top names, this is NOT an amateur show like alot of the meetups. I just ask that everyone who Rsvp's really do their best to show up AND MAKE IT ON TIME. as you know I dont charge for this meetup so come out see the hottest comedy show and maybe even make some new friends. this sundays line up includes the below.<\/p> <p>This week, Ashley Morris hosts a show with: Gary Vider, Seaton Smith (Comedy Central), Chris Distefano (MTV), Vlad Camaano (NBC), Jon Laster (Comedy Central) and pretty much any comic you see on Comedy Central these days drops by and shows up on the lineup who knows who might drop by usually its Amy Shumer or Judah Friedlander.<\/p> <p>I will be at the front end of the bar by the iphone charger as usual to meet with everyone and give you tickets for free admission and have everyone sit together so we can all share laughs. Try to be early the show starts at 8 and everyone sits at same table but i do this earlier so all of you can meet your fellow meetup members. This is a 2 show ticket, so if you show up for the 8 you can stay for the ten also which has a different but also comedy central lineup.
