Lights=safety, as any six-year old with a monster under the bed will happily attest. Baltimore City is showing its' fellow commitment to safety, and so in solidarity we want everyone to remember, safety is our third priority! Wear ALL your blinkie lights from old proms that you keep locked in a keepsake drawer because they still smell like Hunter from AP Biology; wear your Christmas lights that only work intermittently when you screw them (in) just right; wear LED Lights because you ARE the brightest even if you only got waitlisted at Dartmouth; wear your hard hat from that Village People costume where you wanted to be the hot leather daddy, or at least the hot cowboy, but you got stuck with the tepid construction worker and the only good thing about that scenario was that now you knew, unequivocally, where you were in the social pecking order of that particular group of friends; wear your safety vests for safety dancing; wear your cranium lamps (bring these 4 real), and NEON. Neon shorts, neon shirts, neon pants, neon hats, and neon underwear. But don't wear neon condoms because we don't want to overdo it, that would be tacky. Just wear regular condoms, duh.

The market continues to stand in its original site. The land for this historical market was donated by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_John_Eager_Howard\">General John Eager Howard<\/a>, famous colonial Revolutionary War commander of Maryland Line regiment of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Continental_Army\">Continental Army<\/a>. from his estate \"Belvedere\" (also known as \"Howard's Woods) west and north of Baltimore Town. The market originally operated without sheds and stalls. Farmers would load up their horse drawn wagons with ham, butter, eggs and produce. The farmers would travel from Towson and Reisterstown to sell their goods at the market. They would usually start work by dawn.<\/p> <p>In 1803 the market had increased in size.

Pre-registered Vegan Pledges pledge to live vegan for the duration of the program (approximately one month) with the help of volunteer Vegan Coaches, the VLP educational sessions and materials, and the supportive, encouraging community that forms at each year's program. The goal of the VLP is to springboard participants into lifelong vegan living. OTCA runs a program in Baltimore, Maryland in early Spring, and a program on Long Island in New York in late Spring\/early Summer. If you're vegan-curious, we encourage you to register as a Vegan Pledge at www.VeganLivingProgram.org. If you've lived vegan for a year or more, and would like to help someone else make the transition, please join us as a Vegan Coach: www.VeganLivingProgram.org. Participation in the program is FREE and open to all. Vegan Pledges and Coaches need to pre-register, but anyone may drop by and participate in a VLP educational session, so be sure to invite your vegan-curious friends and family!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1261297063886384\/\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1261297063886384\/<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/20s-and-30s-Vegans\/events\/229385565\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":7200000,"name":"(VLP) Vegan Nutrition & Meal Planning with Dr. Ruby Lathon","id":"229385565","time":1459612800000,"updated":1459621665000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1449375441000,"name":"20s and 30s Vegans of Baltimore, Columbia, and DC Meetup","group_lon":-76.8799972534,"id":19185955,"urlname":"20s-and-30s-Vegans","group_lat":39.2099990845,"who":"Vegans"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Parkville ","address_1":"North Plaza Shopping Center, 8810 Waltham Woods Rd","name":"Bill Bateman's Bistro","lon":-76.5425,"id":24419649,"lat":39.399006,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":8.61257362366,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457638115000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We came in 2nd place during the 10 week tournament, now help us compete for the $1000 grand prize!!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/York-Young-Professionals-Happy-Hour\/events\/229493602\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":10800000,"name":"$1000 Triva Finals","id":"229493602","time":1459616400000,"updated":1459628171000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1370827255000,"name":"York Young Professionals Happy Hour","group_lon":-76.6900024414,"id":8855462,"urlname":"York-Young-Professionals-Happy-Hour","group_lat":39.9799995422,"who":"Young Professionals"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21234","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Parkville","address_1":"2175 Cromwell Bridge Rd","name":"Cromwell Valley Park","lon":-76.542671,"id":669717,"state":"MD","lat":39.416641,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.69621658325,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457278323000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Let's meet at the Nature Center at Cromwell Valley Park for their Spring Adventure Trek.

The room was jammed pack, the conversations were real. We realized that there was just more discussing we had to do. Thus the #afterthedress 4-part series was birthed.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Hear from your sister friends who can share a thing or two about surviving 10, 15, 20, 25 years and beyond. Hear how they\u2019ve coped, how they\u2019ve lasted, how they\u2019ve managed and how they\u2019ve survived. Married women hear from single women who desire to be married but have a hard time finding healthy marriages to emulate. Hear from single women who want to get married but are afraid to. Hear from divorced women who\u2019ve been there and done that and can share with you what marriage is and what it isn\u2019t.\u00a0<\/p> <p>While there are overarching topics we plan to discuss the conversation is meant to flow organically. We think its better that way. We have women attending from a variety of backgrounds. (married, single, mothers, divorce.)<\/p> <p>This is a time for self-reflection, healing, sharing, learning, relating, hearing, being transparent, and being real, raw and authentic. We dare not walk around thinking we have all the answers but have realized that when you can remain open, you can receive exactly what it is that you need.\u00a0<\/p> <p>We are not on an island by ourselves. We need each other. Our families, our livelihood, our love lives, the healing of our community depend on this discussion.

This will give us an opportunity to use what we learn on March 21 about shooting night photography. To see more about the event, go to\u00a0&lt;a&gt;LightCity&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p> <p>There is a pamphlet (<a href=\"http:\/\/lightcity.org\/map\/\">Map<\/a>)\u00a0that you can download from that site, but it's sized\u00a0for a 19\"x13\" paper; if you do print it on regular 8.5\"x11\" paper, the type will be so small you won't be able to read it.\u00a0I've put together a map with sites listed that you can easily print on regular paper (<a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/11932242\/Baltimore%20Photowalk.pdf\">LightShow map<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Well, finally here are the details:<\/p> <p><br\/>There are several options for this event. You can drive yourself, but parking may be a problem since the Light Show is a large event. If you want to carpool, make your request below in the comments so you can get together. The light rail is a good alternative: you may join me for the ride or come at a later time and meet up with the group.<\/p> <p>I am going to Hunt Valley to ride the light rail into Baltimore at 3:30 PM. The station's address is\u00a098 Shawan Rd, Hunt Valley, MD. The train will arrive at the Convention Center, the closest station to the Inner Harbor, at approximately 4:20.\u00a0Cost for a ticket is $1.70 one way; for anyone over 65, it's only 70\u00a2 one way. I've included an abbreviated light rail schedule with the above <a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/11932242\/Baltimore%20Photowalk.pdf\">LightShow map<\/a>.<\/p> <p>I plan to walk around to scout what's going on and if you haven't come along on the train, we will meet at the southwestern side of the Harborplace Waterfront Pavilions (click on \"Harborplace Pavilions\" above) at 5 PM to touch base. Look for a group of people with cameras and red ribbons tied on their equipment (be sure to tie a red ribbon on yours).<\/p> <p>Sunset is supposed to be at 7:32 with civil twilight going until 7:59. The light shows are supposed to go into the night. I'm not sure about tripods\u2014they'll definitely be an asset, but I'm not sure how they'll work if there are crowds. One alternative is to make a string tripod that you can use in a pinch. Bring along a small flashlight to help you see your camera settings. Be sure to download the <a href=\"http:\/\/files.meetup.com\/11932242\/Baltimore%20Photowalk.pdf\">LightShow map<\/a> (a map of the area and an abbreviated light rail schedule), so you can print them at home\u2014don't forget to bring them along.\u00a0<\/p> <p>At the moment, I think that I'll stay in Baltimore until the 9:06 train that gets back into Hunt Valley at 10 PM.<\/p> <p>Note that if it's supposed to rain on Saturday, I reserve the right to postpone this event. If that happens, I'll post it here and email anyone who has signed up.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/York-County-Camera-Club\/events\/229078185\/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"PhotoWalk: Baltimore Inner Harbor","id":"229078185","time":1459630800000,"updated":1459733035000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1389199719000,"name":"York County Camera Club","group_lon":-76.5999984741,"id":11932242,"urlname":"York-County-Camera-Club","group_lat":40.0200004578,"who":"Photographers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21212","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"5851 York Road, 21212","lon":-76.60994,"phone":"410-889-6005","name":"Amazing Spiral","id":18099092,"state":"MD","lat":39.362984,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"distance":5.08164262772,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454280216000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Guided Meditations will be offered on the first Saturday of the month.<\/p> <p>Can you improve your health by taking some time to meditate?<\/p> <p>YES!

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather. I assume we're all capable of making that decision as each of us sees fit.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>If you decide to respond \"Yes\" to this event and later change your mind for whatever reason, please,please go in and change your RSVP to a \"No\".

If you guys have any suggestions, please let me know.\u00a0<\/p> <p>Languages confirmed for this meetup will be the following; Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Creole, Krio\/Pidgin, and Swahili. That said, I'd also like to encourage new members who speak other languages to come out as well; the more variety the better.\u00a0<\/p> <p>HOSTS: The idea is to eventually have hosts designated for each language. This way everyone will have an opportunity to practice their language. Imagine being able to practice 10 or more languages in one place; that is the direction in which this group is headed! If you'd like to be a host for this meetup, or have an idea for a future meetup, please let me know. I look forward to seeing you guys next week!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"There will be a meetup sign at our table(s).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Language-Exchange\/events\/229769903\/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":7200000,"name":"Weekly Meetup at Panera","id":"mjhjmlyvfbkc","time":1459710000000,"updated":1459720950000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1440870217000,"name":"Baltimore Language Exchange","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18879933,"urlname":"Baltimore-Language-Exchange","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Language lovers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21044","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Columbia","address_1":"Hyla Brook Road","name":"Wilde Lake","lon":-76.86171,"id":1533706,"state":"MD","lat":39.224598,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":12,"headcount":9,"distance":13.7260370255,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1459626809000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Sunday will be 48 degrees &amp; sunny with 20 mph wind at 3:00 p.m. Bring your jacket &amp; a hat that won't blow off and go in the water! \u00a0 Great day for a doggy walk :)<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><img src=\"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/1\/2\/f\/600_433576687.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\u00a0Wilde Lake is a little gem of Columbia, 1.49 miles long, often we walk it twice to make it longer.<b>Directions: Coming from south of the mall.....Travel North on Little\u00a0Patuxent\u00a0Pkwy past the Columbia Mall.

We should be. It's difficult to find someone up to our standards and who will return our affections. In these budding romantic months we often think about how the future will unfold with this person and how lucky we are. Then as time goes by we naturally learn more and more about our choice. Often the effort put forth at the beginning of the relationship wains. However, at this point, we are invested emotionally in our storyline about who this person is and sometimes that storyline tends to break with reality. The exhilaration felt at the beginning of the relationship becomes elusive when you realize this person isn't who you thought they were. If you decide to make a longer commitment in any romantic relationship you will undoubtedly run into the serious topics of where to live, money, religion, child care, sex and the larger family. In at least some of those categories you can expect some major differences between all people no matter how perfect they seemed at first. Some couples avoid these topics which can lead to undue suffering. A healthier alternative is learning to vocalize the discrepancies and agree to disagree. The skill of respecting and validating our partners ideas is a must have in any committed relationship. This can be a challenging skill when our partners opinions directly affect us. Please join us on April 4, 2016 where Bob Gordon will be presenting on respecting your partners points of view and how to handle the conflicts which can arise in romantic relationships.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainEllicottCity\/events\/228247135\/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"name":"Love's Points of View","id":"228247135","time":1459810800000,"updated":1459823046000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347632348000,"name":"Single Again - Columbia\/Ellicott City","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4927242,"urlname":"SingleAgainEllicottCity","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21037","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Edgewater","address_1":"2517 Solomons Island Rd","lon":-76.54341,"phone":"(410) 573-0201","name":"Elks Lodge","id":223729,"state":"MD","lat":38.969654,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":22.5571899414,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438023553000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Monday(s) -<\/b> Every Monday.<\/p> <p><b>Cost:<\/b> Pay As You Go<\/p> <p><b>Description:<\/b> BRIDGE ANYONE ??? \u00a0We are reverting to playing party bridge on Monday evenings at 7pm at the Elks Lodge #622.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

By contrast, Argentine tango is danced for personal enjoyment - not an audience. It is completely improvisational - and quite unlike any other type of social dance. Often compared to learning and speaking a foreign language, the dance is a conversation between leader and follower -- one that is unpredictable from one step to the next. It is also a dance that attracts and incredible diversity in age, backgrounds - even style. It is a dance where you find your own style -- and you can dance it forever.

Please understand this is an intermediate ride due to this terrain.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Waiver:<\/b> Mountain biking is a risky sport, By signing up for this meetup you are agreeing to our waiver located here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/MVD-Mountain-Bikers\/pages\/Standard_Waiver_for_Meetup_Rides\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>With the days being shorter we will probably need lights on the way out. Please be prepared! If you are looking for a cheap decent light see \"what to bring\" below.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>Where\/Directions<\/b>: Rockburn Elementary School<\/p> <p><b>What time:<\/b> Meet between 5:45 and 6:00 at parking lot. Wheels rolling by 6:00. We will not wait past 6:00.<\/p> <p><b>Pace:<\/b> Pace will be Intermediate, approx. 6.5 to 7 mph. Appropriate for average to riders, but not for beginners, or people who are not riding at least once a week. Attitude is laid-back and friendly, but please ensure you can handle the pace and length of this ride before committing. This is a no-drop ride, i.e., we wait up for everyone at intersections. (Please survey your current fitness, as no one likes to be the one person holding up a larger group). Please also note Ptap rides tend to be about 1 mph slower than Rosy, or Fairland, due terrain.<\/p> <p><b>Terrain:<\/b> Ranges from Easy to Difficult. Most trails are in great shape, but plan on some mud spots. There are a few very steep climbs, rocks and technical sections, log overs (up to 10\" logs, and 3' stacks), tight single track (12\" wide in spots), and a stream crossing or two. A strong\/advanced rider will be able to clean most sections, others will need to get off of their bikes in spots. This is a friendly ride, so we will wait up for everyone, just be advised that the terrain can be somewhat difficult in places. This is a video edit I made from last fall through winter. We won't hit all of this terrain, but gives you a feel for Patapsco:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M\" class=\"embedded\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-DLM17FYo3M<\/a><\/p> <p><b>Distance:<\/b> With days starting shorter, the rides will be a little shorter, but I'm still trying to maintain about 12 to 15 miles. Exact route will change depending on group dynamics, trail conditions, daylight, etc. I will typically have route planned in my head at the beginning of the ride, but will modify as needed to get us back at a reasonable time. Distance will grow with more daylight.<\/p> <p><b>Duration:<\/b> I shoot to have us back around 8:30, so around 2 1\/2 hours. This can change with mechanical issues, and group dynamics though. As this is a weekday ride, the stops will be just long enough for the last rider to catch their breath. Note: wheels roll at stated time, so please don\u2019t be late.<\/p> <p><b>Bring:<\/b> Helmet (required), water (as much as you can carry), spare tube\/patch kit, pump\/CO2, multi-tool, I.D., emergency contact info where it can be easily located on your person, and a good attitude, as this ride is as much about camaraderie as it is about riding. Take a look at your bike and make sure it is in good working condition (Ptap will take its toll on the bike). Bring a light, as you will probably need it with the days starting off shorter. There are ton of acceptable lights under $20 on Amazon right now. Just look for a T6 Cree LED Bike light, with minimially 1000 lumens.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!

The opera takes place in the Japanese port city of Nagasaki at the turn of the last century, at a time of expanding American international presence. Japan was hesitantly defining its global role, and Nagasaki was one of the country\u2019s few ports open to foreign ships. Temporary marriages for foreign sailors were not unusual.<\/p> <p>Puccini achieved a new level of sophistication with his use of the orchestra in this score, with subtle colorings and sonorities throughout. But the opera rests squarely on the performer of the title role: on stage for most of the time, Cio-Cio-San is the only character that experiences true (and tragic) development. The singer must convey an astounding array of emotions and characteristics, from ethereal to fleshly to intelligent to dreamy-bordering-on-insane, to resigned in the final scene.<\/p> <p>Kristine Opolais reprises her acclaimed portrayal of the title role, opposite Roberto Alagna as Pinkerton, the naval officer who breaks Butterfly's heart. Hei-Kyung Hong, Roberto De Biasio, and Gwyn Hughes Jones star in a second set of performances.

These interests include, among others, Dominance &amp; submission, bondage &amp; discipline, leathersex, fetishism, cross dressing, and roleplay. BESS is multi-sexual. All genders and orientations are welcome to attend.<\/p> <p><br\/>Our goal is to provide a safe, friendly, and discreet environment for the education and encouragement of adults interested in Safe, Sane, and Consensual expressions of BDSM sexuality.<\/p> <p><br\/>Orientation Meetings are free and ensure that you understand the basic ethical values of the Baltimore BDSM community. They also provide information about BESS and gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. The orientations are held at the same location as the BESS Educational meetings and there is no need to reserve in advance. Just be sure to arrive promptly at 7:10pm and inform the BESS staff that you wish to attend an orientation.<\/p> <p><br\/>Educational Meetings are generally held the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, starting at 7:30 pm. They cover a wide range of topics related to BDSM, from play techniques to lifestyle issues and more. These meetings are open to all who wish to attend; there is a small fee for each meeting.<\/p> <p><br\/>For more information see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bess-md.org\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.bess-md.org<\/a><\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BESS-MD\/events\/227879657\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Educational Meeting!

Brown attended Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship and earned an engineering degree. \"I knew right out of college that three geeks in a basement with a silicon chip could create some very dangerous products,\" he told a Forbes interviewer in 1994. \"I don't mind being a geek. It's easier than farming.\"<\/p> <p>With $20,000 in savings Brown, then 26, started a company called IDEAS, Inc. to design computers for the government. He was acting as a consultant for MKD, an electronic cash-register company, when its vice-president, Bernie Silverman, suggested there was a future in making \"smart\" cash registers, that is, point-of-sale terminals. Brown founded PICOS Manufacturing in 1977 to produce these machines for restaurants; the company was renamed Micros Systems the following year.<\/p> <p>After graduating from the Johns Hopkins University with a BSEE degree in 1966, Mr. Brown started his engineering career with Hewlett Packard. In 1970 Mr. Brown and a few colleagues formed IDEAS, Inc. Mr. Brown was the founding President\/CEO of IDEAS, Inc.<\/p> <p>Mr. Brown is one of Washington\u2019s most successful high-tech entrepreneurs.\u00a0 Over the past 45+ years, Mr. Brown led a family of high-tech companies whose success is measured in double-digit growth.\u00a0 The technologies span telecommunications and fiber optic systems; leading-edge information technologies for hospitality information and retail systems; geospatial intelligence; big data analytics; cyber security; M2M and other technology-enablers for the 21st century.\u00a0 All together, these companies now employ over 7,000 people worldwide with combined corporate sales exceeding $2 Billion.<\/p> <p><b>Sponsored By:<\/b><\/p> <p><b><br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/innovate.techcombustion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/gNfOYc6RCmIsp69CVT2j-rand16.jpg\" \/><\/p> <p>South River Technologies provides companies in the Financial, Healthcare and Education verticals with solutions for securely transferring, sharing and collaborating on files over the Internet (think DropBox for Business and that's what we do!).

We believe they convey critical concepts to inspire you and allow you to get to the next level. If you go to only one event this month . . . . . . you should get out more often! \u263a (And you should go to THIS one).<\/p> <p>We\u2019ve edited the videos to show you the best parts in the shortest amount of time.<\/p> <p>The first short video is an interview with psychologist Roger Gould Ph.D., one of the most prominent authorities on emotional eating. He shares the practical solutions that he\u2019s developed throughout his career.<\/p> <p>Next is well-known psychologist Douglas Lisle Ph.D., co-author of \u2018The Pleasure Trap.\u2019 (We have already shown a presentation by his co-author, Dr. Alan Goldhamer). He addresses psychological factors but emphasizes the role of unprocessed plant-based food, which currently makes up about 7% of the American diet.<\/p> <p>Lastly, to break the tie, is an interview with Chef AJ who shares a lot of wisdom in her high energy style. She is a recovering food addict and points out that most people need to address emotional eating AND \u201cgetting the food right.\u201d i.e., you have to do both.<\/p> <p>In total there is about 40 minutes of video to stimulate the discussion, leaving plenty of time for sharing our own challenges and solutions. People find this kind of sharing to be extremely helpful, and there will be plenty of specific ideas and suggestions. There will also be plenty of awesome food - with recipes!<\/p> <p>Your four organizers, Joe, Vlad, Emily and Jamila, will be on hand to help and advise you during and after this meeting. Vlad and Jamila are experienced and inspiring coaches. Joe is an M.D. and Emily is an R.D. (Registered Dietitian). We're not looking for paying clients. In fact, Joe and Emily don't accept paying clients. We just want to help, as volunteers.<\/p> <p>Please bring a dish that is vegan (no dairy, egg, fish or meat of any kind), and not too much, if any, SOS (salt, oil, sugar).<br\/>It's not mandatory to bring food, but please try to bring something to share that fits these criteria, so that we don't run short.<\/p> <p>You can get some ideas at www.NutritionAsMedicine.org.<\/p> <p>If no time to cook, you can just bring some fruit, etc. If you're not in a position to bring anything for some reason, that's OK, just bring yourself (and friends).<\/p> <p>And if you're new to all of this, you're especially welcome.<\/p> <p>If you are bringing a dish, PLEASE bring a piece of paper with your name, the name of the dish AND INGREDIENTS (or recipe, even better, but at least ingredients - for those who are food-sensitive or following certain diets). Your name, and name of the dish, is so people can ask you for the recipe.<\/p> <p>We raffle off great kitchen items each time; no cost to participate. \u00a0The raffle is open to anyone who is attending their first, second or third Meetup here, AND ALSO to anyone who has brought food with a list of ingredients, or the recipe.<\/p> <p>If anyone has questions or wants to chat, please call Joe Adams M.D. at[masked] if you're not sure this is right for you, or if you're looking for a little help on how to break out of whatever barriers you might be facing.<\/p> <p>Please join the free, twice-monthly conference calls for extra support and information, with some of the organizers and other participants. They\u2019re always on the Third Thursday and First Tuesday of each month, at 7:30 pm. \u00a0The dial-in number is always:[masked], and the access code is always[masked]#.

Used in ancient Chinese palaces and temples, and also in the tradition of Kundalini Yoga, <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/angelablueskies\/sets\/gong-samples\"><b>Gong Meditations<\/b><\/a>, also called Gong Baths, are deeply nourishing and restorative. Similar to an extended savasana, the softer sounds are soothing on a deep level, and as the sound level builds, the body and energy are cleared in profound ways. Through the intense vibrations of the sound, the body and mind are able to relax and surrender to the healing energies of the Gong, and as the waves of sound wash over participants, a deep energetic clearing occurs, leaving the participant feeling balanced, peaceful, and light.

A lifelong musician, she received her training as a classical flutist at the prestigious <i>Peabody Institute<\/i> in Baltimore. In her performing career, she began to long for a deeper sense of connection and presence with her audiences. It was while travelling in South America that Angela first encountered traditions that worked with songs and music for healing and transformation. Deeply influenced by sacred ceremonies from Peru and the traditions of bhakti yoga and kirtan, she began to experiment with creating music for healing and meditation. Expanding beyond her background as a classical flutist, in her sound healing sessions, Angela also works with voice, toning, and mantra, as well as frame drum, rattles, flutes from around the world, singing bowls, and the gong. Her <b>Sound Medicine Journeys<\/b> are intuitively guided energy healing sessions that use song, music, and sound to bring clearing, balancing, and a higher vibration of peace and joy to all those present. In addition to her work with <b>Sound Medicine Journeys<\/b>, she also leads kirtan with several wonderful musicians in the Baltimore\/Washington area, including her band <b>Bhakti Tree<\/b>.

We will start on top of Spruce Knob, the highest place in WV and walk a few miles out the ridge, then a couple miles down to Upper Seneca Creek Falls in one of the prettiest locations as well! Total elevation drop the first day is 1800' over about 5 1\/2 miles. This is one of the prettiest campsites you will ever run across! The next day is a 5 mile walk up the valley for a total elevation gain of 500'. Seneca Creek is the quintessential mountain stream with many watefalls along the way. This is a great walk and a trip you will never forget. Pictures for those more visually oriented are here:<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/6\/4\/event_110584452.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midatlantichikes.com\/id146.html\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midatlantichikes.com\/id146.html\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.midatlantichikes.com\/id146.html<\/a><\/a> Maps are also included as well. I have done this trip since the 70's and I never get tired of it and I think you will agree with me after doing it! Please note this is as close to the \"High Country\" as you can get in the Midatlantic, so come prepared for wind and rain or do not come! That being said, this is one great trip even in the rain with views that make anything from Shenandoah NP seem like flatland! If you have not backpacked with me before, please contact me beforehand as I must be sure you are prepared...I have a group to look after! As always this trip is crossposted from Washington Backpackers Meetup Group, seeya there!<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hikebaltimore\/events\/228636437\/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"name":"Spruce Knob\/ Seneca Creek Backcountry Backpacking Trip","id":"228636437","time":1460158200000,"updated":1460170537000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1134352213000,"name":"The Baltimore Hiking Meetup Group","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":216157,"urlname":"hikebaltimore","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"Hikers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21204","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Towson","address_1":"125 York Rd","name":"American Legion in Towson","lon":-76.603523,"id":716307,"state":"MD","lat":39.396397,"repinned":false},"headcount":180,"distance":7.41901063919,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1456941964000,"fee":{"amount":15,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person Cash or Check","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"0"},"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><i><b>Good Rockin' Daddies<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p>Formerly part of \u201cBig Cam and The Lifters\u201d, Sam and his group have been rockin\u2019 our dances for years!

If the Jonas Green lot fills up, you can try the nearby Severn Inn parking lot.<\/p> <p><b>Walk Across the Severn River to Annapolis<\/b><\/p> <p>From Jonas Green Park, our group will go up a short incline to the foot of the Rt. 450 bridge where we can use the sidewalk that crosses the Severn River. To the left are beautiful vistas of the Chesapeake Bay and the Naval Academy. To the right, there's a scenic view of the Severn River and the many lovely houses and boats along its shoreline.<\/p> <p>Once we're on the Annapolis side, we'll continue walking on Baltimore\/Annapolis Blvd. to King George St. that leads to the U.S. Naval Academy near City Dock.

In addition to its huge array of interesting and rare historical artifacts, the Museum displays an awesome collection of highly-detailed model ships that are accurate in every detail.

But perhaps you also wonder how plants might help in this sometimes overwhelming world where it seems nearly all our food is awash in chemical toxins, deficient in nutrients, and generally grown with disrespect. Perhaps you also have concerns about what seems to be an avalanche of chronic medical conditions in our country, like diabetes, depression, auto-immune diseases, allergies, GI problems, and chronic fatigue, and seek answers beyond the pharmacy prescription. Perhaps you have concerns about how our communities can become more truly self-sufficient, and rather than simply sustainable, resilient and regenerative, and your own household less dependent upon purchased products and materials.<br\/>Perhaps you are also concerned about the daily loss of forests, streams, animals, insects, and plants that seems to be happening at an unimaginable rate everywhere in the world, just to keep our lights on and gas in our tanks. How can we find a way out of this tangle that, frankly, we rely on for almost all our needs? Can we transition, as individuals and communities, towards a more connected and harmonious way of life?<\/p> <p>Questions so big require many ways. This is the plant way. If your heart pulls you to the forest and the sidewalk cracks, then this course can give you the traction to pursue that yearning in its many and diverse applications, and to begin a path of deep apprenticeship to nature itself, for the benefit of the healing of one\u2019s self, one\u2019s community, one\u2019s home-land, and all inner and outer places.<\/p> <p><br\/>Foundations in Botany &amp; Plant Taxonomy<br\/>Keeping a Nature Journal<br\/>Identification &amp; Harvesting of Wild Edible Plants<br\/>Cooking Wild Plants<br\/>Language of Field Guides<br\/>Fundamentals of Western Herbal Medicine<br\/>Drying &amp; Preservation of Plant Material for Food &amp; Medicine<br\/>Seasonal Observation for Harvest Inventory<br\/>Understanding Ecosystems<br\/>Indigenous Cultivation Techniques (Intro to Ethnobotany)<br\/>When Harvesting Ethics Becomes Ecosystem Participation<br\/>Integrating Wild Plants into the Home Garden, Farm, or Food Forest<br\/>Making Simple Medicines<br\/>Intro to Mushrooms<br\/>First Aid &amp; Hygiene Using Plants<br\/>Plants as Material: Fiber, Dye, Fire, Vessels, Tools<br\/>Sensory Exercises &amp; Nature Grounded Meditation<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Foragers-of-Baltimore\/events\/226384264\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"The Forager's Apprentice Course- Spring 2016","id":"226384264","time":1460210400000,"updated":1460221932000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1340392286000,"name":"Foragers of Baltimore","group_lon":-76.6500015259,"id":4145332,"urlname":"Foragers-of-Baltimore","group_lat":39.4300003052,"who":"Foragers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21201","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"901 W.

The road becomes a recreational area for walking, running, biking, and the like.\u00a0 In the warmer months, many people picnic or just relax on blankets and chairs along the water.\u00a0 The views of the water and the surrounding\u00a0wooded areas\u00a0are wonderful all year round.<\/p> <p>It is an \"out and back\" hike, can't possibly get lost, bite off as much as you want to chew.<\/p> <p>The total distance is approximately 3 and 1\/2 miles which we complete in roughly 1 hour, so that you can probably be home before noon, if you want to. But also feel free to stay as long as you like.<\/p> <p>\u00a0<b>Loch Raven is city reservoir property. It, technically, is not a park at all. In other words, no potty facilities, no pavilions, etc. What you see is what you get. So......take care of business before you get there.<\/b><\/p> <p>To get there, if you are travelling north on Dulaney Valley Rd. from the Beltway, the road splits just after crossing a large bridge over the lake. Dulaney Valley Rd. is the one that continues to the right toward the east. That's what you want. Don't go up the hill which is Jarrettsville Pike.<\/p> <p>Travel on Dulaney Valley Road for roughly another mile or so. You will enter the park from the north. To do so, you bear right\/make a right hand turn from Dulaney Valley Rd onto Loch Raven Drive at the corner where Peerce's Plantation\/Landing\/Grille (the name depends on who owns it this week; it's had some turnover in recent years)\u00a0is located.\u00a0 Peerce's address is 12460 Dulaney Valley Road 21131. <b>If your GPS is telling you to go farther north on Dulaney Valley\u00a0Rd past Peerce's, it's just plain wrong !!!<\/b>\u00a0Once you enter the park, the meeting place is about a mile down the road.<\/p> <p>This hike will begin at the road closure gate at the corner of Loch Raven Drive and Morgan Mill Road. Parking is allowed on the west side of Loch Raven Drive and there is a sort of a parking lot on Morgan Mill Road.<\/p> <p>When you see this sign, you've found the right place.\u00a0\u00a0We'll meet right behind it, by where you see the guy\/rock.\u00a0<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/7\/8\/8\/event_139178792.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>Loch Raven Drive\u00a0is a normal, well paved road, so there is no need for \"off road\" footwear unless you choose to get adventurous and challenge the rather steep hills that surround the lake.\u00a0 That is certainly an option for those who are more experienced and confident.\u00a0 However, I am not aware of any sanctioned,\u00a0prepared trails in that area of Loch Raven and can't recommend it.\u00a0 It would be free style.<\/p> <p><b>I will not post cancellations because of the weather.

To request it you must have your own Cold Water Gear as defined in the link above. \u00a0Just send me a Meetup message if that's you.<\/p> <p>Of course this gets us in the Annapolis area to attend the special EMS private sale event at 6:00 PM. \u00a0We'll probably gather at Gordon Biersch's which is just around the corner from EMS for a drink before attending the sale.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Best bet us to search for Truxton Park Boat Ramp on your GPS.

Translated into Hebrew, the title could be ''The Family Paradise.'' The word for ''orchard'' in Hebrew is pardess, which is derived from the ancient Persian pairi daeza, but it can also refer to that first divine orchard and its famous tree in the Garden of Eden, or Paradise, from which man was forever expelled. Set almost entirely in Israel, the book spans 160 years of tumultuous Israeli and family history, from the 1830's, when Palestine was part of the Turkish Empire, through the three major waves, or aliyahs, of Jewish immigration, the British mandate, modern statehood and warfare, up to the present. Historical figures and events flit past in the background of the characters' lives. Unlike most conventional triple-decker novels in this genre, ''The Family Orchard'' is stripped clean of nostalgia and honeyed sentimentality, and the family romance presented here is anything but a paradise. Despite the chronological timeline, reams of plot and a dizzying cast of characters, ''The Family Orchard'' is very much a postmodern novel, heavily indebted to the fabulist, phantasmagorical fiction of I. B. Singer and David Grossman and the esoteric, now fashionable, legends and stories of the cabala.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Baltimore-Jewish-Book-Club\/events\/228959699\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"book discussion of The Family Orchard","id":"228959699","time":1460309400000,"updated":1460564964000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1331755463000,"name":"The Baltimore Jewish Book Club","group_lon":-76.6900024414,"id":3479352,"urlname":"The-Baltimore-Jewish-Book-Club","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Baltimore Bookniks"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21234","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Parkville","address_1":"9621 Harford Road","name":"Atlas Personal Trainers","lon":-76.5215,"id":8882512,"state":"MD","lat":39.39592,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":9.03296852112,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1457360667000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Fitness is an important part of whole-body wellness.

Many people adapt the word to encompass all levels of dependence from fervent addiction to complete independence. Clearly there is a level of dependence in a relationship which is appropriate. However, this balance needs to be found and re-evaluated when you find your life circumstances changing. Personally I like the definition of co-dependence put forth by Charles L. Whitfield in his 1990 paper entitled \"A Gift to Myself\". His definition is \"Suffering and dysfunction associated with or due to focusing on the needs or behaviors of others.\" This is usually accompanied by an unconscious entanglement and inequality in an unchanging relationship. In addition, attempts to change the inequality are met with extreme resistance. Co-dependency removes our agency and reduces our autonomy. Join us on 11 April 2016 where Bob Gordon will be presenting about how to identify co-dependent patterns in relationships and what to do about them.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/SingleAgainEllicottCity\/events\/228247182\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"name":"Am I Co-dependent?","id":"228247182","time":1460415600000,"updated":1460428265000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1347632348000,"name":"Single Again - Columbia\/Ellicott City","group_lon":-76.8300018311,"id":4927242,"urlname":"SingleAgainEllicottCity","group_lat":39.2000007629,"who":"Support Group Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Annapolis","address_1":"333 Dubois Rd","name":"Unitarian Universalist Church of Annapolis","lon":0,"id":23586128,"state":"MD","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":20.9286556244,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421786096000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Community Drum Circle in Annapolis.

Promise, no rocks. None! (there is one section of busted-up concrete, but it's not rocks, and it's only 10-15 feet long). Anyway, there are a couple good places to stop and practice log-overs, and balance on the boardwalks, and some good flow trails.<\/p> <p>First loop (About 5 Miles) Moderate\/Fast:<\/p> <p>This pace will try to not stop often, only to let the last rider catch up or mechanicals. This pace is for those that are intermediate riders wishing to push themselves a bit further the average pace of that category. Normally I average 9mph on this loop. So you've been warned!<\/p> <p>2nd Loop will be beginner friendly and as much as 8-9 miles total, depending on group, pace will be Casual\/Moderate (but it depends on how many beginners we have attending):<\/p> <p>This pace is for regular riders who consider themselves slower than the intermediate category. At times, the pace will be a bit faster than casual rides. We wait up at intersections to let all riders catch up. True beginners may find this pace a bit faster than a casual ride. We're really patient people, at least most of us.\u00a0Please keep in mind that this loop is to encourage beginners to join us, patience is needed from the faster riders, if you wish for a fast competitive pace, this is not the ride for you.<\/p> <p>2nd loop shooting for wheels rolling at 6:30pm.<\/p> <p>Group splitting is very likely if we have 15+ riders joining us.

I'll have my laptop and will try to put together a Vagrant setup with some OpenSource projects, just in case anyone wants to see some code in action.<\/p> <p><br\/>\u2022\u00a0Those driving to the event: Tir Na Nog will validate parking tickets for the parking garage at 100 East Pratt St.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>Those taking the train from D.C.:\u00a0MTA Penn Line Trains leave from DC Union Station:\u00a0<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/mta.maryland.gov\/schedules\/display.php?route=penn_northbound.xls\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mta.maryland.gov\/schedules\/display.php?route=penn_northbound.xls\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/mta.maryland.gov\/schedules\/display.php?route=penn_northbound.xls<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Cabs from Baltimore Penn Station to the Inner Harbor are about $11, but you can also take the free Charm City Circulator:<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcitycirculator.com\/route\/purple\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.charmcitycirculator.com\/route\/purple\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.charmcitycirculator.com\/route\/purple<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>Catch the Circulator by going out the front door of Penn Station and hanging a left onto St Paul St. The Circulator comes about every 10 minutes, and the last bus is about 8:00 PM.\u00a0<\/p> <p><br\/>A special thanks to Red Hat for sponsoring this event!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nHope to see you all there!<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"The back of the bar (where we belong :-).","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Software-Defined-Networking-Group-Baltimore-Washington\/events\/229479545\/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"duration":10800000,"name":"Pub Night (\"I'm not dead yet\")","id":"229479545","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460558209000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1383836741000,"name":"Software Defined Networking Group - Baltimore\/Washington","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":11007622,"urlname":"Software-Defined-Networking-Group-Baltimore-Washington","group_lat":39.2900009155,"who":"SDNuts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"zip":"21210","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"4800 Roland Avenue","name":"Johnny's","lon":-76.635536,"id":16848292,"state":"MD","lat":39.350529,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":4.27246570587,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458049702000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.67000007629},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"how_to_find_us":"thematchpro.com 410-773-9585 or c-410-602-1683","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Singles-Support-Group\/events\/229606168\/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"duration":5400000,"name":"Introduction to the group and support each other as we navigate the dating world","id":"229606168","time":1460500200000,"updated":1460551054000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1457920467000,"name":"Baltimore Singles Support Group","group_lon":-76.6900024414,"id":19704752,"urlname":"Baltimore-Singles-Support-Group","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Singles Support Group"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"distance":1.60778737068,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1380750678000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/c\/7\/c\/event_254928252.jpeg\" \/><b>Attention Musicians &amp; Music Lovers<\/b><\/p> <p><b>ACOUSTIC OPEN MIC AT THE GORDON<\/b><\/p> <p><b>2nd Tuesdays<\/b><\/p> <p><b>7:00-9:00 PM<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Gordon Center Lobby<\/b><\/p> <p>Signup 6:30 PM<\/p> <p>7:00 PM start<\/p> <p>Three songs per performance slot<\/p> <p><b>Hosted by Joanne Gerber and Mark Shapiro<\/b><\/p> <p>Great acoustics!, PA provided, refreshments, mentoring environment with a few local well known musicians involved...

Dr. Mitchell was the 6th man to walk on the surface of the moon, during the Apollo 14 mission in 1971. During the return space trip to Earth, Dr. Mitchell experienced what is known as \u2018samadhi\u2019, which in Sanskrit means a feeling of oneness. \u201cAs he approached the planet we know as home, he was filled with an inner conviction as certain as any mathematical equation he'd ever solved. He knew that the beautiful blue world to which he was returning is part of a living system, harmonious and whole\u2014and that we all participate, as he expressed it later, \"in a universe of consciousness.\"\u201d\u201cThis experience radically altered his worldview: Despite science's superb technological achievements, he realized that we had barely begun to probe the deepest mystery of the universe\u2014the fact of consciousness itself. He became convinced that the uncharted territory of the human mind was the next frontier to explore, and that it contained possibilities we had hardly begun to imagine. Within two years of his expedition, Edgar Mitchell founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973.\u201d IONS continues to perform cutting edge research into the nature of consciousness, transformative learning, and expanding human potential.<\/p> <p>For the April Friends of IONS meeting, we will view a few videos to learn about Dr. Mitchell, about the mission and research of IONS, with time left for discussion. How has expanded consciousness research impacted your life? What life experiences change or transform your consciousness and your perspectives on life. Is there more to life than simple material, mechanical routines in life? Are humans connected to one another, the planet, and the universe or are we just physical, mechanical beings inhabiting a bag of skin and bones?<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are spiritual beings having a human experience\u201d<\/p> <p>~ Alfred Einstein<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS\/events\/230007572\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"IONS Meeting: IONS Mission and Dr. Edgar Mitchell","id":"230007572","time":1460502000000,"updated":1460514779000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1421254044000,"name":"Baltimore Friends of IONS","group_lon":-76.6200027466,"id":18334650,"urlname":"Baltimore-Friends-of-IONS","group_lat":39.3699989319,"who":"Psychonauts, Explorers, Friends"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","city":"Baltimore","address_1":"2400 Boston St, Suite 201","name":"OrderUp HQ","lon":-76.58149,"id":23548959,"state":"MD","lat":39.281616,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":65,"headcount":0,"distance":2.14400482178,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1449665438000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Join us for another round of Ruby, Rails, and more!

Urban Exploration is a very popular activity, but it can be difficult to do legally. Don will explore the risks and pitfalls of this type of photography as well as discuss how you can safely and legally add this type of photography to your portfolio. Don first picked up a camera during his teenage years, shooting mostly black and white film and doing his own darkroom work. His interests shifted to color film in his early twenties, then he did the unexpected, he quit photography. With the advent of Digital Photography, he started shooting again with a passion that had been missing in earlier years. Today Don is drawn to a variety of work, but he considers landscape photography to be at his core. It is his hope that his images bring others to that same level of appreciation.<\/p> <p>Today Don considers himself a professional amateur. The amateur aspect allows him to pursue photography with a passion that many with a 9 to 5 job lack and the professional aspect constantly pushes him to improve his craft. Don tries to capture images in new and unique ways.

For those of you that have never participated in dragon boating before, here are a few handy things to know to make your experience more enjoyable:\u00a0<\/p> <p>- The club has never flipped a boat during practice so the odds of you going completely into the water are very low but please keep in mind that there can be a significant amount of splashing on board. Chances are good that you will get a bit wet while we're out there so you should dress accordingly. Wear clothes that you won't mind getting wet in.<\/p> <p>- As far as footwear goes, some people like to paddle barefoot, some like to wear flip flops and others like water shoes of some sort. Sneakers and shoes like that are usually a bad idea since they can get pretty wet and uncomfortable pretty quickly. - Although the club normally tries to have a cooler available with bottled water, it's not a bad idea to bring a bottle with you to practice to take on the boat. During the summer months especially, it can get pretty warm out there and we like to hydrate regularly.<\/p> <p>- The seats on the boat are not the softest in the world and your butt will most likely be a bit sore after practice. To soften the seat a bit, it is recommended that you bring some sort of pad. There are many different options that our club members use and some of the most popular are gardening knee pads and folded up bath mats. A bunched up towel will suffice as well. - Other handy items that you may want to bring with you are sunglasses, sunscreen, gloves and a hat.<\/p> <p>- Life jackets and paddles are provided to everyone.<\/p> <p>- There is not room on the boat to bring much else with you so please leave everything in your car\/on land.<\/p> <p>- There is a secure waterproof bag available to collect everyone's car keys when we get on the boat.<\/p> <p>- The point of our open practices, is to get people familiar with the sport of dragon boating while demonstrating proper technique and timing. Our coaches are excellent at explaining the mechanics of paddling a dragon boat and working towards the ultimate goal of having all twenty paddlers working as a single unit to move as efficiently through the water as possible, all while having a whole lot of fun!
